The information in the electronic format of the Sequence Listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to synthetic promoter and a synthetic gene which confers broad-spectrum disease resistance to Xanthomonands in plants. The present invention also relates to transgenic plants containing the synthetic gene and plants derived by crossing plants with such transgenic plants. More specifically, the synthetic promoter is a synthetic Xa10 promoter and the synthetic gene is a synthetic Xa10 gene which contains the synthetic Xa10 promoter. The resistance is resistance to bacterial blight and the plants are rice plants. The publications and other materials used herein to illuminate the background of the invention or provide additional details respecting the practice, are incorporated by reference, and for convenience are respectively grouped in the Bibliography. Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria employ a type III secretion system (TTSS) to translocate effector proteins into plant cells where they modulate host cell functions for the benefit of the invasion process (Alfano and Collmer, 2004; Kay and Bonas, 2009). Members of the large AvrBs3 effector family are unique kind of type III effectors produced by pathovars of Xanthomonas and Ralstonia solanacearum (Bonas et al., 1989; Yang and White, 2004; Heuer et al., 2007). AvrBs3-like effectors, also recently referred to as transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors (Yang et al., 2006; Bogdanove et al., 2010), have in common an N-terminus required for type III secretion and a C-terminus containing nuclear localization signals (NLS) and an acidic activation domain (AAD). TAL effectors differ in the middle, a region of typically 33-35 amino acid (aa) long, near-perfect repeats that ends in a 20 aa long truncated repeat. The two hypervariable amino acids at position 12 and 13 of repeats, also termed as repeat-variable di-residue (RVD) (Moscow and Bogdanove, 2009), contribute to repeat polymorphism, whereas the number and order of repeats with polymorphic RVDs in a TAL effector determine the specific activity (Herbers et al., 1992; Yang et al., 2005). Individual TAL effectors activate transcription of specific host susceptibility (S) genes for promoting disease development (Yang et al., 2006; Kay et al., 2007; Sugio et al., 2007; Antony et al., 2010). In order to counteract the disease-promoting strategies, plants have evolved mechanisms that exploit the transcription inducing ability of the TAL effectors (Gu et al., 2005; Romer et al., 2007). Thus, a subset of TAL effectors functions as avirulence effectors and activates the transcription of disease R genes. TAL effectors bind specific DNA sequences in the promoters of S or R genes (Kay et al., 2007; Romer et al., 2007; Romer et al., 2009; Antony et al., 2010). Each RVD from the central repeats of TAL effectors specifically recognizes a nucleotide in the target DNA element with a conserved T at the 5′ end (Boch and Bonas, 2010; Bogdanove et al., 2010). Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice (Nino-Liu et al., 2006). Individual strains of X. oryzae pv. oryzae harbor 11 to 19 TAL effectors (White et al., 2009). TAL effectors from X. oryzae pv. oryzae target to rice genes for either susceptibility (Yang et al., 2006; Sugio et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2010) or resistance to bacterial infection (Gu et al., 2005). TAL effector PthXo1 from X. oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99A targets Os8N3/Xa13/OsSWEET11 in rice (Yang et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2010). The recessive allele of Xa13 (xa13) is unresponsive to PthXo1, and plants with xa13 are resistant to strains of the pathogen that rely solely on the PthXo1 as the essential effector for virulence (Yang et al., 2006). The xa13-mediated resistance to rice bacterial blight can be defeated by induction of the S gene Os-11N3, another member of the N3 gene family, by strains of the pathogen utilizing the TAL effectors AvrXa7 and PthXo3 (Antony et al., 2010). PthXo6 and PthXo7 are two other TAL effectors from PXO99A and target respectively to two transcription factor genes, OsTFX1 and OsTFIIA γ1, in rice (Sugio et al., 2007). OsTFX1 encodes a bZIP transcription factor whereas the gene product of OsTFIIA γ1 is the small subunit of the transcription factor HA (Sugio et al., 2007). The induction of OsTFIIA γ1 located on chromosome 1 by PthXo7 may reflect the adaptation of PXO99A to the resistance mediated by xa5 (Iyer and McCouch, 2004), an allele of OsTFIIA γ5 encoding a second form of the TFIIA small subunit on chromosome 5 of rice (Sugio et al., 2007). The DNA target sequences of PthXo1, EBEPthXo1(Effector Binding Element for PthXo1), has been identified in the promoter of Os8N3 (Antony et al., 2010), whereas the DNA target sequences of PthXo6 and PthXo7 remain to be identified or verified in the promoters of OsTFX1 and OsTFIIA γ1, respectively, although the putative target sequences were predicted (Boch et al., 2009). Three TAL effectors, AvrXa7 and AvrXal10 from PXO86 (Hopkins et al., 1992) and AvrXa27 from PXO99A (Gu et al., 2005), activate disease resistance when rice plants carried the cognate R genes Xa7, Xa10 or Xa27. So far, only the Xa27 gene has been isolated and published (Gu et al., 2005). Xa27 is induced by AvrXa27 and the gene can provide non-specific resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae if the AvrXa27-inducible promoter is replaced with a stress-inducible promoter from the rice PR1 gene (Gu et al., 2005; Tian and Yin, 2009). The full induction of Xa27 by AvrXa27 requires OsTFIIA y5, the gene product of Xa5 on chromosome 5 (Gu et al., 2009). A 16- to 18-bp DNA cis-element, designated as UPTAvrXa27 (UPregulated by TAL effector AvrXa27or EBEAvrXa27), was identified in the promoter of Xa27 to be specifically induced by AvrXa27 (Boch et al., 2009; Romer et al., 2009). Xa10 confers narrow-spectrum race-specific resistance to a few Philippine races of X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Yoshimura et al., 1995). The R gene was introgressed from rice cultivar Cas 209 into susceptible rice variety IR24 (Mew, 1982; Yoshimura et al., 1983). Xa10 was finely mapped to a genetic region of 0.28 cM between proximal marker M491 and distal marker M419 on the long arm of chromosome 11 and co-segregated with markers S723 and M604 (Gu et al., 2008). The Xa10 gene was recently cloned by map-based cloning and genetic transformation approaches (International Published Application No. WO 2012/033462). A functional target sequence of AvrXa10, EBEAvrXa10 was identified in the promoter of Xa10 (International Published Application No. WO 2012/033462). The Xa10 gene product, XA10, is functional in both monocots and dicots by inducing hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death (unpublished). The resistance specificity of TAL effector-dependent R gene to bacterial blight is determined by the R gene promoter rather than the R gene products (Gu et al., 2005). Meanwhile, the spectrum of TAL effector-dependent R genes to bacterial blight varies greatly, which is depended on the availability of the avirulence TAL effectors in the X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains (Gu et al., 2004; Gu et al., 2008). Romer et al (2009) demonstrated that multiple functionally distinct DNA elements targeted by separate TAL effectors retain their function and specificity when combined into one promoter. It is desired to generate broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight in rice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to synthetic promoter and a synthetic gene which confers broad-spectrum disease resistance to Xanthomonands in plants. The present invention also relates to transgenic plants containing the synthetic gene and plants derived by crossing plants with such transgenic plants. More specifically, the synthetic promoter is a synthetic Xa10 promoter and the synthetic gene is a synthetic Xa10 gene which contains the synthetic Xa10 promoter. The resistance is resistance to bacterial blight and the plants are rice plants. By “isolated” is meant a biological molecule free from at least some of the components with which it naturally occurs. As used herein, “gene” refers to a nucleic acid sequence that encompasses a 5′ promoter region associated with the expression of the gene product, any intron and exon regions and 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions associated with the expression of the gene product. As used herein, “genotype” refers to the genetic constitution of a cell or organism. As used herein, “phenotype” refers to the detectable characteristics of a cell or organism, which characteristics are the manifestation of gene expression. The terms “polynucleotide,” “nucleotide sequence,” and “nucleic acid” are used to refer to a polymer of nucleotides (A, C, T, U, G, etc. or naturally occurring or artificial nucleotide analogues), e.g., DNA or RNA, or a representation thereof, e.g., a character string, etc., depending on the relevant context. A given polynucleotide or complementary polynucleotide can be determined from any specified nucleotide sequence. A nucleic acid or polypeptide is “recombinant” when it is artificial or engineered, or derived from an artificial or engineered protein or nucleic acid. For example, a polynucleotide that is inserted into a vector or any other heterologous location, e.g., in a genome of a recombinant organism, such that it is not associated with nucleotide sequences that normally flank the polynucleotide as it is found in nature is a recombinant polynucleotide. A protein expressed in vitro or in vivo from a recombinant polynucleotide is an example of a recombinant polypeptide. Likewise, a polynucleotide sequence that does not appear in nature, for example a variant of a naturally occurring gene, is recombinant. The term “nucleic acid construct” or “polynucleotide construct” means a nucleic acid molecule, either single- or double-stranded, which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or which has been modified to contain segments of nucleic acids in a manner that would not otherwise exist in nature. The term nucleic acid construct is synonymous with the term or “expression cassette” when the nucleic acid construct contains the control sequences required for expression of a sequence of the present. invention. A “vector” is another type of nucleic acid construct. The vector may be an expression vector, a replication vector or a transformation vector. The term “control sequences” is defined herein to include all components, which are necessary or advantageous for the expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention. Each control sequence may be native or foreign to the polynucleotide sequence. At a minimum, the control sequences include a promoter and transcriptional stop signals. The control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences to the nucleotide sequence. The term “operably linked” is defined herein as a configuration in which a control sequence is appropriately placed at a position relative to the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid construct such that the control sequence directs the expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention. In the present context, the term “expression” includes transcription of the polynucleotide. In the present context, the term “expression vector” covers a DNA molecule, linear or circular, that comprises a polynucleotide of the invention, and which is operably linked to additional segments that provide for its transcription. “Protein modifications” are provided by the present invention which include one or more amino acid substitutions. Substitutional variants typically contain the exchange of one amino acid for another at one or more sites within the protein, and may be designed to modulate one or more properties of the polypeptide, such as stability against proteolytic cleavage, without the loss of other functions or properties. Amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. Preferred substitutions are ones which are conservative, that is, one amino acid is replaced with one of similar shape and charge. Conservative substitutions are well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art and typically include, though not exclusively, substitutions within the following groups: glycine, alanine; valine, isoleucine, leucine; aspartic acid, glutamic acid; asparagine, glutamine; serine, threonine; lysine, arginine; and tyrosine, phenylalanine. Certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids in a protein structure without appreciable loss of interactive binding capacity with structures such as, for example, antigen-binding regions of antibodies or binding sites on substrate molecules or binding sites on proteins interacting with a polypeptide. Since it is the interactive capacity and nature of a protein which defines that protein's biological functional activity, certain amino acid substitutions can be made in a protein sequence, and its underlying DNA coding sequence, and nevertheless obtain a protein with like properties. In making such changes, the hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. The importance of the hydrophobic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is generally understood in the art. Alternatively, the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity. The importance of hydrophilicity in conferring interactive biological function of a protein is generally understood in the art (See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101). The use of the hydrophobic index or hydrophilicity in designing polypeptides is further discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,691,198. The term “plant” includes whole plants, shoot vegetative organs/structures (e.g. leaves, stems and tubers), roots, flowers and floral organs/structures (e.g. bracts, sepals, petals, stamens, carpels, anthers and ovules), seed (including embryo, endosperm, and seed coat) and fruit (the mature ovary), plant tissue (e.g. vascular tissue, ground tissue, and the like) and cells (e.g. guard cells, egg cells, trichomes and the like), and progeny of same. The class of plants that can be used in the method of the invention is generally as broad as the class of higher and lower plants amenable to transformation techniques, including angiosperms (monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants), gymnosperms, ferns, and multicellular algae. It includes plants of a variety of ploidy levels, including aneuploid, polyploid, diploid, haploid and hemizygous. The term “heterologous” as used herein describes a relationship between two or more elements which indicates that the elements are not normally found in proximity to one another in nature. Thus, for example, a polynucleotide sequence is “heterologous to” an organism or a second polynucleotide sequence if it originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is modified from its original form. For example, a promoter operably linked to a heterologous coding sequence refers to a coding sequence from a species different from that from which the promoter was derived, or, if from the same species, a coding sequence which is not naturally associated with the promoter (e.g. a genetically engineered coding sequence or an allele from a different ecotype or variety). An example of a heterologous polypeptide is a polypeptide expressed from a recombinant polynucleotide in a transgenic organism. Heterologous polynucleotides and polypeptides are forms of recombinant molecules. The term “transfecting” as used herein refers to the deliberate introduction to a nucleic acid into a cell. Transfection includes any method known to the skilled artisan for introducing a nucleic acid into a cell, including, but not limited to, Agrobacterium infection, ballistics, electroporation, microinjection and the like. The term “broad-spectrum disease resistance” as used herein refers to resistance to a wide variety of strains of a causative agent. As an example, a wide variety of strains may be strains of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and the disease bacterial blight in rice. TAL effectors from xanthomonads target host genes for promoting disease or triggering disease resistance. They bind to the effector binding elements (EBEs) in the promoters of host genes and induce their expression. Xa10 is an R gene in rice that confer race-specific resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, the causal agent of bacterial blight in rice. The Xa10 gene product, XA10, is functional in both monocots and dicots by inducing hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death. In accordance with the present invention, novel resistance specificity and increased resistance spectrum of the Xa10 genes are accomplished by synthesizing a modified Xa10 gene with an engineered promoter containing 5 EBEs targeted by either virulent or avirulent TAL effectors (termed Xa10E5 herein). The Xa10E5 gene was generated and used for production of transgenic rice. A stable transgenic rice line, L2, was obtained. L2 had two copies of the Xa10E5 gene and conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight. The Xa10E5 gene in L2 plants was specifically induced by X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains expressing one of the corresponding TAL effectors and conferred broad-spectrum resistance to 27 of the 28 field strains of X. oryzae pv. oryzae tested. Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a synthetic promoter comprising a rice Xa10 promoter that has been modified to contain multiple Effector Binding Elements (EBE) each of which binds a different transcription activator-like (TAL) effector. In one embodiment, the synthetic promoter contains an EBEpthXo7 sequence. In another embodiment, the synthetic promoter contains an EBEpthXo1 sequence.

In accordance with the present invention, the method comprises transfecting a synthetic Xa10 gene described herein or a vector comprising a synthetic Xa10 gene described herein into a plant cell or into plant cells and producing a transgenic plant from the transfected plant cell or transfected plant cells. In accordance with the present invention, the synthetic Xa10 gene is expressed in the transgenic plant. Transfecting the synthetic Xa10 gene or vector into a plant cell or into plant cells is also sometimes referred to herein as transforming a plant cell or plant cells with the synthetic Xa10 gene or vector. In one embodiment, the plant cell or cells is a rice cell or cells. Such methods are well known to the skilled artisan or described further below. In a fifth aspect, the present invention provides a transgenic plant having at least one copy of a synthetic Xa10 gene described herein stably incorporated into its genome. In one embodiment, the transgenic plant contains two copies of the synthetic Xa10 gene. In another embodiment, the transgenic plant contains three copies of the synthetic Xa10 gene.

In accordance with the present invention, the transgenic plant or plants of the present invention can be used in conventional breeding programs. In one embodiment, the transgenic plant used in a breeding program is the transgenic rice plant referred to herein as the L2 plant or L2 line or progeny thereof. Generally, the vector or expression cassette may additionally comprise a selectable marker gene for the selection of transformed cells. Selectable marker genes are utilized for the selection of transformed cells or tissues. Usually, the plant selectable marker gene will encode antibiotic resistance, with suitable genes including at least one set of genes coding for resistance to the antibiotic spectinomycin, the streptomycin phosphotransferase (spt) gene coding for streptomycin resistance, the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) gene encoding kanamycin or geneticin resistance, the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt or aphiv) gene encoding resistance to hygromycin, acetolactate synthase (als) genes. Alternatively, the plant selectable marker gene will encode herbicide resistance such as resistance to the sulfonylurea-type herbicides, glufosinate, glyphosate, ammonium, bromoxynil, imidazolinones, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D), including genes coding for resistance to herbicides which act to inhibit the action of glutamine synthase such as phosphinothricin or basta (e.g., the bar gene). See generally, International Publication Nos. WO 02/36782 and WO 2008/094127, U.S. Pat. No. 7,205,453 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006/0218670, 2006/0248616, 2007/0143880 and 2009/0100536, and the references cited therein. See also, Jefferson et al. (1991); De Wet et al. (1987); Goff et al. (1990); Kain et al. (1995) and Chiu et al. (1996). This list of selectable marker genes is not meant to be limiting. Any selectable marker gene can be used. The selectable marker gene is also under control of a promoter operable in the plant species to be transformed. Such promoters include those described in International Publication No. WO 2008/094127, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0245339, and the references cited therein. See also, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0313773 and 2010/0199371 for an exemplification of additional markers that can be used in accordance with the present invention. Alternatively, the vector or expression cassette may additionally comprise a Cre-lox recombination marker free system, such as described herein. Such a system is useful for producing selection marker free transgenic plants. In preparing the vector or expression cassette, the various DNA fragments may be manipulated, so as to provide for the DNA sequences in the proper orientation and, as appropriate, in the proper reading frame. Toward this end, adapters or linkers may be employed to join the DNA fragments or other manipulations may be involved to provide for convenient restriction sites, removal of superfluous DNA, removal of restriction sites, or the like. For this purpose, in vitro mutagenesis, primer repair, restriction, annealing, resubstitutions, e.g. transitions and transversions may be involved. Once a nucleic acid, such as a synthetic Xa10 gene described herein, has been cloned into a vector or an expression vector, it may be introduced into a plant cell using conventional transformation procedures. The term “plant cell” is intended to encompass any cell derived from a plant including undifferentiated tissues such as callus and suspension cultures, as well as plant seeds, pollen or plant embryos. Plant tissues suitable for transformation include leaf tissues, root tissues, meristems, protoplasts, hypocotyls, cotyledons, scutellum, shoot apex, root, immature embryo, pollen, and anther. “Transformation” means the directed modification of the genome of a cell by the external application of recombinant DNA from another cell of different genotype, leading to its uptake and integration into the subject cell's genome. In this manner, genetically modified plants, plant cells, plant tissue, seed, and the like can be obtained. The nucleic acids, vectors or constructs may be introduced into the genome of the desired plant host by a variety of conventional techniques. Techniques for transforming a wide variety of higher plant species are well known and described in the technical and scientific literature. Transformation protocols may vary depending on the type of plant or plant cell, i.e., monocot or dicot, targeted for transformation, as is well known to the skilled artisan. For example, the DNA construct may be introduced directly into the genomic DNA of the plant cell using techniques such as electroporation and microinjection of plant cell protoplasts, or the DNA constructs can be introduced directly to plant tissue using ballistic methods, such as DNA particle bombardment. Alternatively, the DNA constructs may be combined with suitable T-DNA flanking regions and introduced into a conventional Agrobacterium tumefaciens host vector. The virulence functions of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens host will direct the insertion of the construct and adjacent marker into the plant cell DNA when the cell is infected by the bacteria. Thus, any method, which provides for effective transformation/transfection may be employed. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,241,937, 7,273,966 and 7,291,765 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2007/0231905 and 2008/0010704 and references cited therein. See also, International Published Application Nos. WO 2005/103271, WO 2005/017158, WO 2008/094127, WO 2012/033462 and references cited therein. Transformed plant cells which are derived by any of the above transformation techniques can be cultured to regenerate a whole plant which possesses the transformed genotype and thus the desired phenotype, e.g., a transgenic plant. A “transgenic plant” is a plant into which foreign DNA has been introduced. A “transgenic plant” encompasses all descendants, hybrids, and crosses thereof, whether reproduced sexually or asexually, and which continue to harbor the foreign DNA. Regeneration techniques rely on manipulation of certain phytohormones in a tissue culture growth medium, typically relying on a biocide and/or herbicide marker which has been introduced together with the desired nucleotide sequences. See for example, International Published Application No. WO 2008/094127 and references cited therein. The foregoing methods for transformation are typically used for producing a transgenic variety in which the expression cassette is stably incorporated. After the expression cassette is stably incorporated in transgenic plants, it can be transferred to other plants by sexual crossing. In one embodiment, the transgenic variety could then be crossed, with another (non-transformed or transformed) variety, in order to produce a new transgenic variety. Alternatively, a genetic trait which has been engineered into a particular cotton line using the foregoing transformation techniques could be moved into another line using traditional backcrossing techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach could be used to move an engineered trait from a public, non-elite variety into an elite variety, or from a variety containing a foreign gene in its genome into a variety or varieties which do not contain that-gene. As used herein, “crossing” can refer to a simple X by Y cross, or the process of backcrossing, depending on the context. Any of a number of standard breeding techniques can be used, depending upon the species to be crossed. Once transgenic plants of this type are produced, the plants themselves can be cultivated in accordance with conventional procedures. Transgenic seeds can, of course, be recovered from the transgenic plants. These seeds can then be planted in the soil and cultivated using conventional procedures to produce transgenic plants. The cultivated transgenic plants will express the synthetic Xa10 gene to provide broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight. The cultivated transgenic plants can also be used in conventional breeding programs to derive additional plants that will express the synthetic Xa10 gene to provide broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight. The practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, recombinant DNA, genetics, immunology, cell biology, cell culture and transgenic biology, which are within the skill of the art.

EXAMPLES The present invention is described by reference to the following Examples, which is offered by way of illustration and is not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Standard techniques well known in the art or the techniques specifically described below were utilized. Example 1 Materials and Methods TAL effectors and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) strains: TAL effector genes, avrXa10 , avrXa27, pthXo1, pthXo6 and pthXo7, have been reported previously (Hopkins et al., 1992; Gu et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2006; Sugio et al., 2007). TAL effector genes were cloned into vector pBluescript and placed under lacZ promoter. The intermediate construct were then fused with cosmid vector pHMl (GenBank Accession No. EF059993) at the Hind III site. Cosmid constructs carrying the TAL effectors were introduced into X. oryzae pv. oryzae strain 1947 by electroporation. Twenty-eight field strains of X. oryzae pv. oryzae, which were collected from 11 countries were used in this study. Plants and growth conditions: IRBB10A is an improved near-isogenic line (NIL) of Xa10 in the IR24 genetic background (Gu et al., 2008). Nipponbare is a japonica rice cultivar. Rice plants, including transgenic plants, were grown in a greenhouse at a temperature of 32° C. and 25° C. for 12.5 h (light) and 11.5 h (dark), respectively. Binary construct: Binary construct pCXA10E5 carrying Xa10E5 (FIG. 1) was made based on pCAS4671, which harbors 4671-bp AvrII-SacI genomic clone of Xa10 in binary vector pC1300. A 661-bp synthetic BamHI-NruI DNA fragment containing EBEpthXo7, EBEpthXo1, EBEAvrXa10, EBEpthXo6 and EBEAvrXa27 were used to replace the 657-bp BamHI-NruI fragment in the native promoter of Xa10 gene. The pCXA10E5 was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 by electroporation. Rice transformation: Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Nipponbare was carried out using the method described previously (Hiei et al., 1994) with slight modification. Briefly, vigorously growing embryogenic calli derived from the scutellum of mature embryos was co-cultured with A. tumefaciens strains harbouring binary plasmids for 2 days. After co-culture, the rice tissues were washed and then cultured on selection medium comprising NB basal medium (NB0 medium; contains the macronutrients described by Chu (1975) and the micronutrients described by Gamborg et al. (1968)) containing 2 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 250 mg/L cefotaxime and 50 mg/L hygromycin at 26° C. in the dark. After 4 weeks selection, the hygromycin-resistant calli were excised from co-cultivated callus and transferred to regeneration medium comprising NB0 medium containing 2.0 mg/L kinetin (KT), 0.02 mg/L α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 50 mg/L hygromycin. Three weeks later the regenerated hygromycin-resistant plantlets were transferred to plantlet medium comprising ½ strength MS basal medium (½ MS0 medium; MS basal medium defined by Murashige and Skoog (1962)) containing 50 mg/L hygromycin for shoot and root elongation. Regenerated plantlets were subsequently transplanted to the soil in pots and grown in a greenhouse. Bacterial blight inoculation and disease scoring: Bacterial inoculation was carried out using the leaf-clipping method (Kauffman et al., 1973). Briefly, X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains were grown on PSA medium (10 g/l peptone, 10 gl sucrose, 1 g/l glutamic acid, 16 g/l bacto-agar, and pH 7.0) for 2 days at 28° C. The bacterial cells were collected and re-suspended in sterile water at an optical density of 0.5 at OD600. The bacterial cell suspension was applied to the two youngest, but fully expanded, leaves of each tiller by clipping 5-6 cm, from the tip of the leaf using a pair of scissors dipped in the inoculum. Lesion length (LL) was measured 2 weeks after inoculation. The disease symptom was scored as resistant (R, LL≦3.0 cm), moderately resistant (MR, 3.0 cm<LL≦6.0 cm), moderately susceptible (MS, 6.0 cm<LL≦9.0 cm) and susceptible (S, LL>9.0 cm) (Gu et al., 2004). Southern blot analysis: Rice genomic DNA was isolated from leaf tissues according to the procedures described previously (Dellaporta et al., 1983). About 2 μg of DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, separated on 0.8% agarose gel and blotted to Hybond™−N+nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, GE healthcare, USA). DNA hybridization was conducted according to standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989). DNA probes were labeled with DIG system (Roche Applied Science, USA). The DNA probe for the Hpt gene was amplified by PCR using DNA primers Hpt-F (5′AAAAAGCCTGAACTCACC GCG3′; SEQ ID NO:18) and Hpt-R (5′TACTTCTACACAGCCATCGGT3′; SEQ ID NO:19). The DNA probe for the Xa10 gene was amplified by PCR using DNA primers Xa10-F (5′CACGGGCCCCCTCCTGTTTGC3′; SEQ ID NO:20) and Xa10-R (5′CCTCGTCGTCTTCA CCAATGCAG3′; SEQ ID NO:21). The primers used for recovering the Xa10E5 gene from the L2 line were Seq F5 (5′CTAGGTTTATTGGCTGAGCAATG3′; SEQ ID NO:22); Seq R5 (5′TCTAACTGTCGCCGATCTGCTG3′; SEQ ID NO:23), Seq F4 (5′TTCTTCTTCCTTCCT CTCTCTAC3′; SEQ ID NO:24), Seq R4 (5′TCACTCGCCATGTCTCTACTTC3′; SEQ ID NO:25), Seq F3 (5′AGGAAAGGTGAGAAGGGAATTG3′; SEQ ID NO:26), Seq R3 (5′GTTT AGCTCGACTTTCGACCCAG3′; SEQ ID NO:27), 4686F (5′CTGGGTCGAAAGTCGAGCT AAAC3′; SEQ ID NO:28), Xa10H5R (5′CCATCGTGATATATATGGGCCTCAGACG3′; SEQ ID NO:29), Seq F1 (5′GCCATACTCTTCTACCTCTCTG3′; SEQ ID NO:30), Seq R1 (5′TTATTCTTTTCATATCATTTGATTC3′; SEQ ID NO:31), Seq F2 (5′GTAAAACTATAT GTGTACATGG3′; SEQ ID NO:32) and Seq R2 (5′TCCTCGCTAAATTAAAGTGATG3′; SEQ ID NO:33). Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR): qRT-PCR was carried out in accordance with the procedures described previously (Gu et al., 2011) using a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad). Total RNA was extracted from rice leaves at 24 hours post inoculation (hpi) with X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains. The total RNA samples were first treated with DNase I, and then reversely transcribed to first-strand cDNAs using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To ensure maximum specificity and efficiency during quantitative PCR, oligo primers were further tested for linearity by constructing standard curves on five or six serial 10-fold dilutions. A standard reaction mixture (15 82 l) contained 2 μl cDNA template, 1× SsoFast EvaGreen supermix (Bio-Rad) and 500 nM forward and reverse primers. The PCR reaction was conducted at an initial denaturing step of 98° C. for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 98° C. for 5 s, 55° C. for 5 s. A melting-curve reaction was subsequently performed for 5 s, starting at 75° C. with 0.2° C. increments. PCR product specificity was confirmed by melting-curve analysis and separation on a 2% agarose gel to ensure that the PCR reactions were free of primer dimers. The rice ubiquitin gene 1 (Ubi1) was used as an internal reference to normalize the relative amount of total RNA for all samples. The qRT-PCR experiments were repeated for three times. Rice Ubi gene was used as an internal control. The specific primers for Xa10 were 10RTF2 (5′GGCATCATCTTCTCCGGCG3′; SEQ ID NO:34) and 10RTR2 (5′GCAGCTATACGGGCATAAG3′; SEQ ID NO:35). The specific primers for Ubi1 were RBQ3 (5′CCAGTAAGTCCTCAGCCATG3′; SEQ ID NO:36) and RBQ4 (5′TTTC AGACACCATCAAACCAG3′; SEQ ID NO:37). Example 2 Production of Transgenic Lines Carrying Xa10E5 Transgenic rice plants were produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Nipponbare (Hiei et al., 1994). After one month subculture of co-cultivated calli on selective medium, 1,896 hyromycin-resistant calli were obtained. However, most of the hyromycin-resistant calli turned brown and eventually died after they were transferred onto regeneration medium and cultured under light. Only a few of the hyromycin-resistant calli remained healthy and eventually regenerated transgenic plantlets. Finally, 8 independent transgenic lines were obtained. Some lines might have more than one T0 plants derived from a single transformed cell. T0 plants were transplanted to soil and grown in greenhouse. Five-week-old T0 plants were inoculated with X. oryzae pv. oryzae strain 1947 expressing AvrXa10. Disease evaluation at two weeks after bacterial blight inoculation indicated that only T0 plants from two lines, L2 and L5, conferred complete resistance to 1947(pHMlAvrXa10). Other T0 plants were susceptible to the Xa10-incompatible strain. Eight T0 plants of L2 were obtained and they all displayed normal morphological phenotype and growth duration compared to that of wild-type plants. One T0 plant of L5 was obtained and the plant showed slightly stress-related phenotypes, such as stiff leaves and longer growth duration, compared to that of wild-type. The stress-related phenotypes were more severe in homozygote in the T2 or T3 generations. L5 was abandoned for further study. There were at least 6 copies of T-DNA in the T0 plants of L2 detected by Southern blot analysis using Hpt probe. They could be separated in the T1 generation (FIG. 2A). However, only one copy of T-DNA, which showed the hybridized band at about 5.0 kb detected by Hpt probe, carried functional Xa10E5 gene and co-segregated with the resistant phenotype. T2 plants that only carried the functional Xa10E5 gene were obtained from T2 progeny of T1-80 (FIG. 2B). One of the T2 plants, T2-36 carried homozygous Xa10E5 gene. T2-36 had two copies of Xa10E5 gene with hybridized bands at about 5.2 kb and 7.4 kb, respectively, detected by Xa10 probe (FIG. 2C). The two hybridized bands were greater than the expected 2866-bp band of the BamHI-XbaI fragment from the Xa10E gene (FIG. 1). In addition, the two copies of Xa10E5 gene co-segregated in the subsequent generation (FIG. 2C). The results indicated that the two copies of Xa10E5 gene were parts of the two truncated T-DNAs which were integrated into Nipponbare genome in the same or closely-related location after illegitimate T-DNA integration. The intact Xa10E5 gene, consisting of the Xa10E5 promoter (2456 bp), the Xa10 coding region (381-bp), the Xa10 terminator (378 bp) and a 434-bp 3′ region flanking the Xa10 terminator, were recovered from the T2-36 plant and its progeny by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. The genomic sequence of Xa10E5 recovered from L2 is set forth in SEQ ID NO:12. The regions of the genomic sequence of Xa10E5 are as follows: nucleotides 1-2456 is a Xa10E5 promoter; nucleotides 2457-2837 is the Xa10 ORF; nucleotides 2838-3215 is a Xa10 terminator; and nucleotides 3216-3649 is a 3′ region flanking the Xa10 terminator. T2-36 progeny were still designated as L2 that carries functional Xa10E5 genes for the further studies. Example 3 Xa10E5 Was Induced by X. oryzae pv. oryzae Strains Expressing the Corresponding TAL Effectors L2 plants conferred resistance to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains 1947(pHM1avrXa10), 1947(pHM1avrXa27), 1947(pHM1pthXo1), 1947 (pHM1pthXo6) and 1947(pHM1pthXo7), whereas Nipponbare plants were susceptible to all these strains (FIG. 3). In control experiments, both L2 and Nipponbare were susceptible to X. oryzae pv. oryzae strain 1947 (FIG. 3). qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the Xa10E5 gene in L2 plants was activated after inoculation with incompatible X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains (FIG. 4). The expression levels of Xa10 transcripts in L2 plants inoculated with 1947(pHM1avrXa27), 1947(pHM1pthXo1), 1947(pHM1pthXo6) or 1947(pHM1pthXo7) were comparable to that of Xa10 transcripts in IRBB10A plants inoculated with 1947(pHM1avrXa10) (FIG. 4). The expression level of Xa10 transcripts in L2 plants inoculated with 1947(pHM1avrXa10 ) was only 13% to that of Xa10 transcripts in IRBB10A plants inoculated with 1947(pHM1avrXa10) (FIG. 4), which was still sufficient to provide complete resistance to the incompatible strain (FIG. 3). Likewise in IRBB10A plants, the Xa10 transcript was not detected in the L2 plants after mock inoculation or inoculation with 1947(pHMl) (FIG. 4). Example 4 Xa10E5 Conferred Broad Spectrum Resistance to Multiple Field Strains Collected from Different Countries Twenty-eight field strains of X. oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) collected from different rice growing countries around the world (Table 1) were used to test the resistant spectrum of Xa10E5 in L2 plants to bacterial blight disease. Non-transgenic Nipponbare plants were susceptible or moderate susceptible to most of the X. oryzae pv. oryzae strains tested and only showed moderate resistance to GD1358 from China and CIAT1185 from Columbia (Table 1). IRBB10A is an improved near-isogenic line of Xa10 in IR24 genetic background (Gu et al., 2008).
