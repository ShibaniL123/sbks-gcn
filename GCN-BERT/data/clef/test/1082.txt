Preparation of compound 45-d.
Compound 45-e (7.5 g, 40 mmol) was dissolved in chloroform (300 mL) at 0°C. Activated manganese dioxide (35 g, 400 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring was continued for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered through diatomite and the filter cake was washed with chloroform (100 mL × 3). The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure to delivera white solid 45-d (6.6 g, yield: 89%). This product was used without further purification.
