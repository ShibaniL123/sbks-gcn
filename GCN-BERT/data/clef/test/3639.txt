COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR CAPTURE OF CELLULAR TARGETS OF BIO ACTIVE AGENTS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/736,426 filed December 12, 2012; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/883,313 filed September 19, 2013; both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. FIELD The present invention provides compositions and methods for capture and identification of the cellular targets of a bioactive agent. In particular, provided herein are bioactive agents tethered to capture ligand, cellular targets (endogenous or optionally tagged with a reporter), capture proteins (optionally present as capture fusions), surfaces (e.g., displaying capture ligands, capture proteins, or capture fusions), and methods of capturing and identifying the cellular targets of a bioactive agent therewith. BACKGROUND Cell-based phenotypic screening is increasingly being used for discovery of bioactive drug candidates. The targets of drug candidates naturally operate within a cellular context, and how they interact with bioactive molecules (e.g., synthetic molecules) is significantly influenced by this context. For this reason, when trying to identify unknown targets to bioactive molecules, it is preferable to allow the target to bind to the bioactive molecules within a living cell, before being captured for identification. Thus, methods that allow binding to occur in cell lysates before capture are not as preferred. This is true for the primary targets that mediate the desired bioactivity, and for off targets that may result in liabilities or interferences. Discovering and validating protein targets for such bioactive molecules often uses a combination of affinity enrichment and mass spectrometry methods. Such methods face several challenges. First, the often moderate to weak binding between a target molecule and a protein target makes it hard to capture a target protein or protein complexes or biases the results towards high affinity interactors. Moreover, affinity enrichment methods typically use a solid support immobilized with the candidate target molecule. The kinetics of binding on solid surfaces are much slower when compared to solution-based kinetics, further decreasing the chance of capturing a target protein or protein complexes. Non-specific binding of proteins from cell lysate to the solid support results in high background that further complicates the identification of the cellular target using mass spectrometry (MS). Such methods often result in a large number of putative hits, making it necessary to run secondary screens to validate the potential targets. High-throughput validation assays for target molecule-protein interactions require further development and optimization making it resource intensive process.

DEFINITIONS As used herein, the term “capture protein” refers to a protein which forms a stable .0 covalent bond with its substrate and/or ligand upon interaction therewith. A capture protein may be a receptor that forms a covalent bond upon binding its ligand or an enzyme that forms a covalent bond with its substrate. An example of a suitable capture protein for use in embodiments of the present invention is the HALOTAG protein described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,425,436 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). .5 As used herein, the term “capture fusion” refers to a fusion of two or more copies of a capture protein. The term “capture dimer” may also be used to refer to the fusion of two capture proteins (e.g., heterodimer, homodimer, etc.). The capture proteins are stably linked (e.g., covalently), tethered, and/or fused in a manner such that each capture protein within the fusion is capable of forming a covalent bond with a substrate and/or ligand. The capture 10 proteins may be attached directly to each other or may be separated by a linker (e.g., peptide or other chain or polymer). The capture proteins may be expressed as a fusion protein (e.g., with or without a linker) or may be chemically or enzymatically linked post-expression. As used herein, the term “capture ligand” refers to a ligand, substrate, etc. that forms a covalent bond with a capture protein upon interaction therewith. An example of a suitable capture ligand for use in embodiments of the present invention is the HALOTAG ligand described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,425,436 (herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). As used herein, the term “cellular target” refers to a protein, polypeptide, nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA), polysaccharide or a complex comprising any of these with a polypeptide(s). A cellular target could be composed of more than one component, subunit or polypeptide, e.g., the cellular target is a protein complex. Examples of a cellular target may include a receptor or an enzyme. As used herein, the term “bioactive agent” refers generally to any physiologically or pharmacologically active substance or a substance suitable for detection. In some embodiments, a bioactive agent is a potential therapeutic compound (e.g., small molecule, peptide, nucleic acid, etc.), or drug-like molecule. Bioactive agents for use in embodiments described herein are not limited by size or structure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention provides compositions and methods for capture and identification of the cellular targets of a bioactive agent. In particular, provided herein are bioactive agents tethered to capture ligand, cellular targets (endogenous or optionally tagged with a reporter), capture proteins (optionally present as capture fusions), surfaces (e.g., displaying capture ligands, capture proteins or capture fusions) and methods of capturing and identifying the cellular targets of a bioactive agent therewith. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a sensitive method for discovery and validation of the cellular targets (e.g., protein or protein complex(es)) of bioactive agents (e.g., small and/or drug-like molecules) in cells (See Figure 1). In some embodiments, the present invention finds use as a part of, or a companion to, phenotypic screening assays. For example, a set of small molecules that yield the desired phenotypic response in a phenotypic screen are each tethered to capture ligands (e.g., HALOTAG ligand) by chemical synthesis or enzymatic means. Cells are treated with the small molecule/capture ligand conjugate (e.g., small molecule-HALOTAG ligand conjugate (SM-HTL)) which engages the cellular target (endogenous or optionally fused with a reporter) and re-generates the phenotypic response(e.g., same response, similar response (e.g., ±1%... ±2%... ±5%... ±10%... ±20%... ±30%... ±50%, etc.). In some embodiments, cells are then lysed, and the cellular target, now linked to the capture ligand through bioactive agent, is captured by binding of the capture ligand (e.g., HALOTAG ligand) with a capture fusion (e.g., HALOTAG dehalogenase (e.g., dehalogenase modified to covalently bind its substrate)) or capture protein (e.g., HALOTAG dehalogenase (e.g., dehalogenase modified to covalently bind its substrate)) displayed surface. In some embodiments, the capture fusion is in solution (and is subsequently bound to a solid surface). In other embodiments, the capture protein or capture fusion is bound to a solid surface (e.g., well, tube, slide, plate, matrix, resin, micro fluidics channel, capillary, bead, particle (e.g., microparticle, nanoparticle, etc.), etc. (e.g., capture fusion is bound to surface displaying capture ligands on its surface)). In some embodiments, once the cells are lysed, the cellular target, now linked to the capture ligand through bioactive agent, is captured by binding of the capture ligand (e.g., HALOTAG ligand) with a capture protein (e.g., not a dimer) displayed on a solid surface (e.g., well, tube, slide, plate, matrix, resin, micro fluidics channel, capillary, bead, particle (e.g., microparticle, nanoparticle, etc.), etc.) (See Figure 1, bottom scheme). In some embodiments, methods are provided for the capture or “pull down” of endogenous targets (e.g., known and unknown targets of a small molecule). In some embodiments, endogenous proteins bound to a small molecule/capture ligand conjugate (e.g., (SM-HTL) are then covalently bound (e.g., pulled down) by a capture protein (e.g., displayed on a surface (e.g., well, tube, slide, plate, matrix, resin, micro fluidics channel, capillary, bead, particle (e.g., microparticle, nanoparticle, etc.), etc.)). Such pull-down methods can be followed by analysis to identify the proteins captured (e.g., following elution of the endogeneous target from the surface). Analysis techniques may include Western blotting, gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, etc. The systems, compositions, and methods provided herein provide numerous advantages when used in such a context. In certain embodiments, binding of a chloroalkane-drug conjugate (e.g., HTL-SM) in cells promotes specific interactions leading to higher probability of capturing low affinity targets. In some embodiments, the speed and efficiency of the methods provided herein (e.g., <30 minutes for covalent capture of endogenous targets (e.g., <25 minute, <20 minutes, <15 minutes, <10 minutes, <5 minutes, <1 minute) minimizes complex collapses (e.g., preserves identification of secondary targets (e.g., proteins non-covalently interacting with targets bound by a SM-HTL) and preserves low affinity interactions. In other embodiments, rapid capture minimizes non-specific capture. In certain embodiments, release of endogenous targets by competition with unconjugated drug reduces background which increases detection of low abundance targets. In certain embodiments, after purification of the surface-(capture ligand)-(capture fusion)-(capture ligand)-(bioactive agent)-(cellular target) complex (e.g., by purifying the surface (e.g., mechanical separation, washing, etc.), the cellular target is released or eluted from the solid surface (e.g., well, tube, slide, plate, matrix, resin, micro fluidics channel, capillary, bead, particle (e.g., microparticle, nanoparticle, etc.), etc.) by any suitable mechanism (See figure 2, top scheme). In some embodiments, excess untethered bioactive agent is added to the system to compete the cellular target away from the capture-ligand-tethered bioactive agent. In other embodiments, the linkage (e.g., TEV protease cleavage site) between the two capture proteins of the capture fusion is cleaved (e.g., chemically, enzymatically) to release the (capture protein)-(capture ligand)-(bioactive agent)-(cellular target) complex. In still other embodiments, the linkage between the capture ligand and bioactive agent is cleaved (e.g., chemically, enzymatically) to release the (bioactive agent)(cellular target) complex. In some embodiments, all or a portion of a linker remains attached to one or both released components following cleavage. In other embodiments, after purification of the surface-(capture protein)-(capture ligand)-(bioactive agent)-(cellular target) complex (e.g., by purifying the surface (e.g., mechanical separation, washing, etc.), the cellular target is released or eluted from the solid surface (e.g., well, tube, slide, plate, matrix, resin, micro fluidics channel, capillary, bead, particle (e.g., microparticle, nanoparticle, etc.), etc.) by any suitable mechanism (See Figure 2, bottom scheme). In some embodiments, excess untethered bioactive agent is added to the system to compete the cellular target away from the capture-ligand-tethered bioactive agent. In other embodiments, the linkage (e.g., TEV protease cleavage site) between the reporter and cellular target is cleaved (e.g., chemically, enzymatically) to release the reporter. In other embodiments, the linkage between the capture ligand and bioactive agent is cleaved (e.g., chemically, enzymatically) to release the (bioactive agent)-(cellular target) complex. In still other embodiments, the capture protein is released from the surface, thereby releasing the entire (capture protein)-(capture ligand)-(bioactive agent)-(cellular target) complex. In any embodiments, in which the cellular target is fused/linked to a reporter, the reporter remains linked to any complex comprising the cellular target, unless otherwise specified (e.g., upon cleaving of the link between the cellular target and reporter). In some embodiments in which the cellular target is attached/fused to a reporter molecule (e.g., fluorophore, luciferase, etc.), the cellular target, liberated from the capture complex, is detected by generating and/or detecting a signal from the reporter. In other embodiments in which the cellular target is attached/fused to a reporter molecule (e.g., fluorophore, luciferase, etc.), the cellular target, still bound to the capture complex, is detected by generating and/or detecting a signal from the reporter. In some embodiments (e.g., in which the cellular target is not attached/fused to a reporter molecule), the cellular target, liberated from the capture complex, is characterized and/or identified (e.g., by biophysical and/or biochemical analysis (e.g., mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, etc.). Capture of cellular targets of bioactive agents is facilitated by the interaction (e.g., covalent or non-covalent) of a capture ligand (e.g., small molecule (e.g., HALOTAG ligand)) with a capture protein (e.g., receptor protein, HALOTAG dehalogenase, etc.). In certain embodiments, the capture ligand/capture protein interaction occurs twice, in separate steps of the capture systems and methods described herein (See Figure 1). First, a capture ligand is tethered, or otherwise attached, to the bioactive agent of interest. Once the bioactive agent has become bound to its cellular target (e.g., in vivo), a capture fusion (e.g., a homodimer of capture entities) is added, and the capture ligand is bound by one of the capture entities. Next, a solid support displaying a plurality of the same capture ligands is added, and the unbound half of the capture fusion binds to the surface. The cellular target is now tethered to the solid support by two capture ligand/capture protein interactions (See Figure 1). In an alternative embodiment, the capture fusion is bound to the solid support (e.g., via its interaction with surface displayed capture ligands) prior to addition to the assay (and prior to binding the capture ligand tethered to the bioactive agent. Either alternative results in the same captured configuration. In other embodiments, a capture protein is present as a capture monomer, not a capture fusion. In some embodiments, a solid support (e.g., well, tube, slide, plate, matrix, resin, micro fluidics channel, capillary, bead, particle (e.g., microparticle, nanoparticle, etc.), etc.) is provided displaying capture monomers (e.g., HALOTAG dehalogenase) on its surface. Capture ligands tethered to bioactive agents are immobilized on the surface when the capture ligand (e.g., HALOTAG ligand) and capture protein (e.g., HALOTAG) interact. If the bioactive agent has interacted (e.g., stably, at equilibrium, etc.) with a cellular target (e.g., tagged by a reporter), the cellular target becomes linked (e.g., through the bioactive agent, capture ligand, and capture protein) to the solid support. In certain embodiments, compositions, methods, and systems herein provide bioactive agents. In some embodiments, a conjugate of a bioactive agent and a capture ligand is provided. In some embodiments, a bioactive agent is any small molecule, macromolecule, or molecular complex capable of interacting with the biology of a cell. In some embodiments, a bioactive agent and capture ligand (e.g., HALOTAG ligand) are fused, tethered, connected, etc. by any suitable structure or mechanism (e.g., chemically linked (e.g., directly or indirectly), enzymatically linked, linked by a linker (e.g., peptide, nucleic acid, polymer, ester linkage, PEG linker, carbon chain, etc.)). The type of linkage should not be viewed as limiting. In some embodiments, a capture ligand comprises, and/or is tethered to a bioactive agent by, a linker moiety. In some embodiments, a linker moiety is part of the capture ligand. In some embodiments, a linker moiety is added to a capture ligand via coupling chemistry for attachment to the bioactive agent. In some embodiments, a linker moiety is added to a bioactive agent via coupling chemistry for attachment to the capture ligand. The present invention is not limited to any particular linker moiety.

Any suitable linkers, utilizing any suitable functional groups, are within the scope of embodiments of the invention. In particular embodiments, a linker is a carbamate linker. In some embodiments, a bioactive agent is attached to a capture ligand by a linker, and attachment of the entity of interest is reversible (e.g., cleavable (e.g., photocleavable, chemically cleavable, enzymatically cleavable)). In some embodiments, a linker is cell permeable. In some embodiments, the above linkers find use in attaching or tethering other components (e.g., capture proteins) described herein. In some embodiments, a capture ligand (and linker) comprises or consists of -0(CO)NH(CH2CH20)y-(CH2)x-halogen, wherein y is 1-8, χ is 2-20, and halogen is Cl, Br, or F (e.g., -0(C0)NH(CH2CH20)2(CH2)xC1, 0(CO)NH(CH2CH20)2(CH2)6-halogen, 0(C0)NH(CH2CH20)2(CH2)6-Cl,etc.). In certain embodiments, libraries of bioactive agents (e.g., >10 agents, >50 agents, >100 agents, >500 agents, >1000 agents, >5000 agents, >10,000 agents, >50,000 agents, etc.) are provided. In some embodiments, systems, methods, and compositions are provided for screening libraries of bioactive agents for a phenotypic effect and/or activity. In some embodiments, the present invention provides means of capturing the cellular target of any bioactive agents in a library responsible for producing, eliciting, inducing, etc. phenotypic effect and/or activity. In some embodiments, the present invention provides means of capturing, identifying, characterizing, etc. the cellular target of a bioactive agent (e.g., a bioactive agent responsible for the phenotypic effect and/or activity). In some embodiments, a cellular target comprises any suitable binding/interaction partner (e.g., receptor, enzyme) for a bioactive agent (e.g., small molecule, protein, nucleic acid, lipid, etc.). In particular embodiments, a cellular target is a protein that binds to or otherwise interacts with (e.g., stably, specifically, non-covalently, at equilibrium, etc.) a bioactive agent. In more particular embodiments, a cellular target is a receptor protein or an enzyme that binds to or otherwise interacts with (e.g., stably, specifically, non-covalently, at equilibrium, etc.) a small molecule bioactive agent. The present invention is not limited by the identity, type, or class of cellular targets. In certain embodiments, libraries of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, more different cellular targets find use in the present invention. In some embodiments, the cellular target is expressed in cells in which an assay is to be performed. In some embodiments, the cellular target is expressed at or near the endogenous levels (e.g., native abundance) for the cellular target (e.g., no overexpression of cellular targets). In some embodiments, methods herein allow for capture of cellular targets present in cells at or near their natural or endogenous abundance, thereby maximizing the biological relevance of an assay. In certain embodiments, because the methods allow for capture at endogenous levels of cellular target, the methods are useful for the capture of unknown targets of a bioactive agent (e.g., those that one would not see fit to overexpress). In some embodiments, the cellular target is endogenous to the cell. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the capture protein is a dehalogenase enzyme modified to form covalent bonds with its substrate (See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,425,436; U.S. Patent No. 7,429,472; U.S. Patent No. 7,867,726; U.S. Patent No. 7,888,086; U.S. Patent No. 7,935,803; U.S. Patent No. RE42,931; U.S. Patent No. 8,168,405; U.S. Patent No. 8,202,700; U.S. Patent No. 8,257,939; herein incorporated by reference in their entireties), referred to herein as a “HALOTAG dehalogenase,” and the capture ligand is a substrate for a HALOTAG dehalogenase, for example, a haloalkane, reference to herein as a “HALOTAG ligand.” In some embodiments, a capture protein comprises a polypeptide with at least 70% sequence identity (e.g., 75% identity, 80% identity, 85% identity, 90% identity, 95% identity, 98% identity, 99% identity) with SEQ ID NO.: 1. In some embodiments, the capture ligand comprises a carbamate linker. In certain embodiments, the capture ligand is a chloroalkane ligand with a carbamate linker, e.g., a carbamate chloroalkane. In some embodiments, a reporter is an entity capable of generating, exhibiting, and/or emitting a signal (e.g., fluorescence, resonance energy, etc.) when triggered by specific conditions (e.g., upon energy absorption). In certain embodiments, compositions, methods, and systems herein provide a fusion of a cellular target and a reporter (e.g., bioluminescent reporter (e.g., luciferase (e.g., NANOLUC))). In some embodiments, a cellular target and reporter are fused, tethered, connected, etc. by any suitable structure or mechanism (e.g., expressed as a fusion construct (e.g., with or without peptide linker), chemically linked (e.g., directly or indirectly), enzymatically linked, linked by a linker (e.g., peptide, nucleic acid, other polymer (e.g., ester linkage, PEG linker, carbon chain, etc.)). In some embodiments, the reporter is a bioluminescent reporter (e.g., expressed as a fusion protein with the cellular target). In certain embodiments, the bioluminescent reporter is a luciferase. In some embodiments, a luciferase is selected from those found in Omphalotus olearius, fireflies (e.g., Photinini), Renilla reniformis, Aequoria, mutants thereof, portions thereof, variants thereof, and any other luciferase enzymes suitable for the systems and methods described herein. In some embodiments, the bioluminescent reporter is a modified, enhanced luciferase enzyme from Oplophorus (e.g., NANOLUC enzyme from Promega Corporation, SEQ ID NO: 3 or a sequence with at least 70% identity (e.g., >70%, >80%, >90%, >95%) thereto). In some embodiments, the protein sensor is a thermostable Photuris pennsylvanica luciferase. Exemplary bioluminescent reporters are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Αρρ. No. 2010/0281552 and U.S. Pat. Αρρ. No. 2012/0174242, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In some embodiments, the bioluminescent reporter comprises NANOLUC (See U.S. Pat. Αρρ. Nos. 2010/0281552 and 2012/0174242, herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). In some embodiments, the bioluminescent reporter comprises a polypeptide with at least 70% identity (e.g., >70%, >80%, >90%, >95%) to SEQ ID NO: 3 that retains bioluminescent characteristics. In certain embodiments, the use of the NANOLUC enzyme, or a variant thereof, provides features (e.g., signal intensity, brightness, high light output, narrow spectrum, etc.) that enable detection of capture cellular target (e.g., at low concentration). In some embodiments, the high light output of NANOLUC enables the low concentration (e.g., <1 μΜ, <100 ηΜ, <10 nm, <1 nm, etc.) of assay components (e.g., DNA for expression of NANOLUC) useful to carry out assays under physiologically relevant conditions. In some embodiments, NANOLUC enables detection of captured cellular targets identified in a phenotypic screen. In some embodiments, a substrate for the bioluminescent reporter is provided. In some embodiments, the bioluminescent reporter converts the substrate into a reaction product and releases light energy, e.g., luminescence, as a byproduct. In some embodiments, the substrate is a substrate for a luciferase enzyme. In some embodiments, the substrate is a substrate for a modified, enhanced luciferase enzyme from Oplophorus, e.g., NANOLUC enzyme from Promega Corporation (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 3). In some embodiments, the substrate comprises coelenterazine, a coelenterazine derivative, a structural or functional equivalent of coelenterazine, a molecule substantially equivalent to coelenterazine (e.g., structurally and/or functionally), or molecule functionally or structurally similar to coelenterazine. In some embodiments, the bioluminescent reporter converts the coelenterazine, coelenterazine derivative, structural or functional equivalent of coelenterazine, or substantial equivalent to coelenterazine into coelenteramide, a coelenteramide derivative, a structural or functional equivalent of coelenteramide, or a substantial equivalent to coelenteramide and releases light energy as a byproduct. In some embodiments, a cellular target is detected based on a characteristic of an attached reporter (e.g., fluorescence, luminescence, mass (e.g., by mass spectrometry (MS)), radioactivity, enzymatic activity, etc.). In some embodiments, a cellular target is detected based on a characteristic of the cellular target (e.g., fluorescence, luminescence, mass (e.g., by mass spectrometry (MS)), radioactivity, etc.). In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a fusion of multiple (e.g. two) capture proteins. In some embodiments, both capture proteins retain their activity when fused (e.g., dimerized). In some embodiments, both capture proteins retain the ability to covalently bind their respective capture ligand. In some embodiments, a capture fusion is a heterodimer of two different capture proteins (e.g., that bind different capture ligands). In other embodiments, a capture fusion is a homodimer of two capture proteins with the same amino acid sequence that bind the same capture ligands. In some embodiments, two capture proteins are covalently linked. In some embodiments, the capture proteins are linked end-toend (e.g., N-C-N-C, N-C-C-N, C-N-N-C, C-N-C-N). In some embodiments, a capture fusion is expressed as two fused proteins. In some embodiments, two capture proteins are attached post-expression (e.g., chemically, enzymatically, etc.) to produce a capture fusion. In some embodiments, the capture proteins (e.g., HALOTAG proteins) are fused, tethered, connected, etc. by any suitable structure or mechanism (e.g., expressed as a fusion, chemically linked (e.g., directly or indirectly), enzymatically linked, linked by a linker (e.g., peptide, nucleic acid, polymer, ester linkage, PEG linker, carbon chain, etc.)). The type of linkage should not be viewed as limiting. In some embodiments, the two capture proteins are directly linked. In some embodiments, the two capture proteins are separated by a linker. Any suitable linker (e.g., peptide (e.g., with protease cleavage site (e.g., TEV cleavage site)), other polymer, alkyl chain, substituted alkyl chain, etc.) may find use in connecting the capture proteins of a capture fusion. In some embodiments, one or both of the capture proteins comprise 70% or greater (e.g., 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%) sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 1. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a capture protein as a monomer (e.g., not as a capture fusion). In some embodiments, a capture protein is linked to a solid surface (e.g., well, tube, slide, plate, matrix, resin, micro fluidics channel, capillary, bead, particle (e.g., microparticle, nanoparticle, etc.), etc.). In some embodiments, a plurality of capture proteins (e.g., as monomers) are attached to a surface. In some embodiments, a capture protein (e.g., HALOTAG proteins) is fused, tethered, connected, etc. by any suitable structure or mechanism (e.g., expressed as a fusion, chemically linked (e.g., directly or indirectly), enzymatically linked, linked by a linker (e.g., peptide, nucleic acid, polymer, ester linkage, PEG linker, carbon chain, etc.)). The type of linkage should not be viewed as limiting. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a sensitive method for discovery and validation that proteins or protein complexes are the binding target of bioactive small molecules in cells. In some embodiments, methods involve selecting a library of small molecules with the desired phenotypic response (e.g., as determined from a phenotypic screen) and attaching a capture ligand (e.g., HALOTAG ligand) by any suitable means (e.g., chemical synthesis). Cells are then treated with the small molecule/capture ligand (SM/CL) to re-generate the phenotypic response. In some embodiments, SM/CL compounds are cell permeable. In some embodiments, cell permeability enables regeneration of the phenotypic response. In some embodiments, chloroalkanes and carbamates are well-suited to preserving and/or enhancing cell permeability. In some embodiments, cells are then lysed, and SM/CL attached to protein or protein complexes are captured. In some embodiments, capture of SM/CL bound to protein complexes is mediated by a fusion of two capture proteins (aka “capture fusion” or “capture dimer”) that allows rapid capture to minimize dissociation of protein interactors and/or reduces the non-specific binding of other proteins. In some embodiments, capture is done on solid support with low non-specific binding properties. In some embodiments, target proteins (e.g., cellular targets) are eluted with high specificity, further reducing the background hence enabling better target identification. In some embodiments, capture fusions (e.g., HALOTAG dimer) or a capture protein (e.g., HALOTAG) in conjunction with a small molecule/HALOTAG ligand conjugate is useful for validation of positive interactions in a high-throughput format. In some embodiments, a capture fusion (e.g., HALOTAG dimer) or capture protein (e.g., HALOTAG) is provided for rapid capture of SM-CL bound to a cellular target (e.g., protein or protein complex). In some embodiments, a HALOTAG dimer or capture protein (e.g., HALOTAG) is used for capture of a bioactive agent/HALOTAG ligand conjugate bound to a cellular target of the bioactive agent. Characteristics of the HALOTAG dimer and/or HALOTAG protein that provide advantages over other capture systems, for example a) rapid kinetics of the reaction of HALOTAG with HALOTAG ligand (e.g., even when the ligand is complexed with a large protein or protein complex) and b) rapid capture accomplished using two different formats (Figure 1). In some embodiments, a HALOTAG dimer (or another capture fusion) or HALOTAG protein (or other capture protein) is used to make HALOTAG protein beads (or other protein capture beads) for covalent capture of HALOTAG ligand (or other capture ligand). HALOTAG (or other capture protein) is oriented for to preserve functional efficiency. Moreover, the HALOTAG dimer binding to the beads is quantitative, thereby allowing accurate control of the protein density at the bead surface. In other embodiments, HALOTAG dimer (or another capture fusion) is added to the solution in a certain stoichiometric excess to small molecule/HALOTAG ligand (or other capture ligand) to take advantage of rapid solution based kinetics for binding of small molecule/HALOTAG ligand (or other capture ligand) and protein complex. In some embodiments, a surface displaying a capture fusion, capture protein, capture ligand, and/or an optimized HALOLINK bead is used for specific capture of complex. In some embodiments, elution of protein complexes from the bead for downstream detection (e.g., mass spectrometry) is critical in identifying correct ‘hit’. In some embodiments, capture fusions (e.g., HALOTAG dimer) comprises a TEV cleavage site that allows selective elution of complexes leaving behind any non-specifically bound protein (e.g., improving signal over background). In some embodiments, using a multi-well plate activated with capture ligand (e.g., HALOTAG ligand), the assay is converted to a high throughput format (e.g., for validation). In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a surface displaying capture proteins (e.g., HALOTAG, HALOTAG dimer, etc.). In some embodiments, a surface is provided that displays ligands (e.g., HALOTAG ligand) for a capture protein on its surface. Capture fusions are added to the surface and become immobilized on the surface. The surface with capture fusions immobilized on its surface is then used to capture (capture ligand)-(bioactive agent)-(cellular target) complexes. In other embodiments, a surface is provided that displays functional groups that allow for immobilization of capture proteins to its surface. Any suitable chemistry may be used for such immobilization. Capture proteins are added to the surface and become immobilized on the surface (e.g., chemically, enzymatically, directly, through a linker, etc.). The surface with capture proteins immobilized on its surface is then used to capture (capture ligand)-(bioactive agent)-(cellular target) complexes. EXPERIMENTAL Example 1 Experiments were conducted during development of embodiments of the present invention to demonstrate the functionality of the capture ligand/capture fusion method of capturing a cellular target of a bioactive agent. ΗΕΚ239Τ cells were grown in wells of 96-well or 6-well plates. The cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA expressing NANOLUC-p38 alpha or NANOLUC-HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) fusion proteins and incubated overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. 10 μΜ of the chloroalkane-drug conjugate BIRB-chloroalkane (for ρ38) or SAHA-chloroalkane (for HDAC6) was then added to the cells and incubated for 2 hours. Negative controls contained cells with no chloroalkane-drug conjugate. The media was then removed, and the cells washed in lxPBS. The cells were lysed Mammalian Lysis Buffer (Promega Corp.) containing HALOTAG protein dimer (dimer of SEQ ID NO: 1) and DNase I for 10 minutes. MAGNE HALOLINK beads (1μ1 bed volume) are then added to the lysed cells and incubated for 15 min. The lysate and beads are washed 3χ at 3 minutes with shaking in wash buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5; 100 mM NaCl; 0.005% IGEPAL). The complex is then eluted from the beads using 150 μΜ unconjugated drug for an hour, and luminescence measured to detect luminescence from the NANOLUC luciferase in the elution (Figures 3A-D). Westem/silver stain analysis of the lysates using anti-p38 was also performed (Figure 4). Example 2 Different amounts of a HALOTAG protein dimer (dimer of SEQ ID NO: 1) were added to cell lysates expressing a NANOLUC-p38 fusion protein (e.g., reporter/cellulartarget fusion) which have or have not been treated with BIRB-chloroalkane (e.g., bioactive-agent/capture-ligand conjugate) as shown in Table 1. After 15 minute incubation, the samples were placed into wells of white, 96-well polystyrene plates activated with HALOTAG ligand (HALOLINK plates; Promega Corp.) and further incubated for 45 minutes. The wells were then washed PBS+0.05% Tween-20 (PBST). Then, 50ul PBS followed by 50ul of NANOGLO luciferase detection reagent was added to the wells, and luminescence measured. Table 2 indicates differences in luminescence in samples with and without HALOTAG dimer (e.g., dimer of SEQ ID NO: 1) that indicate specific pull-down of the NanoLuc-p38 fusion protein.

In this example, a BIRB-chloroalkane conjugate (PBI-4834, see below) was utilized to pull down a NanoLuc-p38 alpha fusion protein from living cells. PBI4834 (BIRB Carbamate Chloroalkane) ΗΕΚ293 cells in wells of a 96-well plate were transfected using PEI with plasmid DNA encoding NANOLUC-p38 fusion. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were incubated with a final concentration of 10μΜ PBI-4834 while control cells were not treated with the conjugated drug. Following equilibrium binding of 2 hours, the media was removed, cells were quickly washed with PBS and lysed in a detergent-based lysis buffer for 10 minutes. The cell lysates were then transferred to wells of a 96-well plate which contained 0.5μ1 settled paramagnetic HALOTAG protein beads (Promega Corp.) and incubated with shaking for 15-45 minutes. Following binding, the unbound fraction was removed and the HALOTAG protein paramagnetic beads were washed. 150uM unconjugated BIRB796 was then added and the captured NANOLUC-p38 alpha fusion was specifically released from the beads by competition with the unconjugated BIRB796 for 60 minutes. The released NANOLUC-p38 alpha fusion protein (+PBI-4834) and control (-PBI4834) was detected using NANOGLO luciferase reagent (Promega Corp.). The high signal over background achieved within 15 minutes of capture on the HALOTAG protein beads demonstrates the efficiency of the capture method, and its ability to capture target proteins that bind to drugs with low to moderate affinity (Figure 5). In this example, only 1% of the expressed fusion was specifically captured to the beads. However, because of the high sensitivity of the NANOLUC luciferase, the level of capture is more than ample for detection of specific capture over background. Example 4 Experiments were conducted during development of embodiments of the present invention to demonstrate the advantage of a carbamate chloroalkane linker for pull-down of a target protein from cells onto HALOTAG protein beads using chloroalkane modified drugs. In this example, methotrexate-chloroalkane conjugates PBI-5015 (carbamate chloroalkane linker) and PBI-4848 (02 chloroalkane linker) were tested for their binding efficiency to HaloTag® protein in lysate, binding efficiency to DHFR in cells and ability to pull down a NANOLUC-DHFR fusion protein from living cells. PBI-5015: Methotrexate Carbamate Chloroalkane PBI-4848: Methotrexate-02 chloroalkane Binding efficiency to HALOTAG protein in lysate was measured by adding methotrexate-chloroalkane conjugates (final concentration luM) to lysate from cells expressing a HALOTAG protein. Following 0-60 min binding, the reaction was chased with 1μΜ fluorescent HALOTAG ligand. Unbound HALOTAG protein was detected through binding to the fluorescent HALOTAG ligand followed by analysis on a SDS-PAGE gel and detection on a fluorescent gel scanner. Results indicate that both linkers provide fast labeling kinetics to the HaloTag® protein (Figure 6Α). Binding affinity to DHFR in live cells was tested using BRET. ΗΕΚ293 cells in wells of a 96-well plate were transfected using PEI with plasmid DNA encoding a NANOLUC-DHFR fusion. The DNA was diluted 1:50 with a promoterless carrier DNA plasmid (PSI) to a final concentration of 80ng total DNA per well. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were serum starved for additional 24 hours and then treated with serially diluted PBI-4848 or PBI-5015 in the presence of 1μΜ PBI-4890 (TOM-methotrexate derivative). After two hours of equilibrium binding, furimazine (a coelenterazine derivative; Promega Corp.) was added to a final concentration of 20μΜ, and BRET measured on a Varioskan luminometer. The doseresponse BRET curves indicate that PBI-4848 has higher affinity to DHFR (Figure 6Β). To demonstrate the ability to specifically pull down NANOLUC:DHFR (Nluc:DHFR) from live cells, ΗΕΚ293 cells in wells of 96-well plate were transfected using PEI with plasmid DNA encoding NANOLUC-DHFR fusion. The DNA was diluted 1:50 with a promoterless carrier DNA plasmid (PSI) to a final concentration of 80ng total DNA per well. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were serum starved for additional 24h and then incubated with 10μΜ PBI-4848 or PBI-5015 while control cells were not treated with the conjugated drug. Following equilibration binding of 2h, the media was removed, and the cells quickly washed with PBS and lysed in detergent-based lysis buffer for lOmin. Cell lysates were then transferred to wells of a 96-well plate containing 0.5μ1 settled paramagnetic HALOTAG protein beads and incubated with shaking for 45min. Following binding, the unbound fraction was removed, the HALOTAG protein paramagnetic beads washed, 150μΜ unconjugated methotrexate added, and the captured NANOLUC:DHFR specifically released from the beads by competition with the unconjugated methotrexate for 60min. The released NANOLUC:DHFR (+PBI5015 or + PBI 4848) and control samples were detected by NANOGLO luciferase detection reagent. Although both PBI-4848 and PBI-5015 have similar binding efficiency to HALOTAG, only PBI-5015 (which has lower affinity to DHFR) efficiently pulled down the Nluc:DHFR fusion, thus demonstrating the advantage of the carbamate linker in pull-down applications (Figure 6C). Methods for specific release of a NANOLUC fusion protein from HALOTAG protein beads include, for example: 1. Competition with unconjugated bioactive agent; 2. Use of a bioactive agent tethered to a capture ligand (e.g., chloroalkane ligand) wherein the capture ligand contains a chemically-cleavable linker (e.g., chloroalkane linker) to allow fast release of the NANOLUC fusion protein; 3. Use of a capture ligand solid support (e.g., HALOLINK HALOTAG resin) wherein the linker attaching the capture ligand (HALOTAG ligand) to the solid support can be chemically cleaved allowing fast release of the capture protein-capture ligand-bioactive agent-cellular target complex (e.g., HALOTAG-chloroalkane-drug conjugate-NANOLUC fusion protein complex); and 4. Proteolytic cleavage of the cellular target from the reporter, e.g., NANOLUC fusion protein released the NANOLUC protein. Experiments were conducted during development of embodiments of the present invention to demonstrate such methods for specific release of the NANOLUC fusion protein from HALOTAG protein beads. In this example, BIRB-chloroalkane conjugate (PBI-4834) and BIRB chloroalkane conjugate containing a cleavable linker (PBI-5131) were utilized to pull- down a NANOLUC-p38 alpha fusion protein from ΗΕΚ293 cell lysates. Lysate of cells expressing NANOLUC-p38 fusion were incubated with 1μΜ PBI-4834 or PBI-5131 (final concentration) while control lysates were not treated with the conjugated drugs. Following equilibration binding for 2h, the lysates were transferred to wells of a 96-well plate containing 0.5μ1 settled paramagnetic HALOTAG protein beads and incubated with shaking for 45min. Following binding the unbound fraction was removed, the HALOTAG protein paramagnetic beads were washed 3χ, and the captured NANLUC-p38 alpha fusion specifically released from the beads by one of two methods: 1. 150μΜ unconjugated BIRB796 was used to compete for binding with the conjugated BIRB796 on the NANOLUC-p38 alpha fusion for 60min. 2. The NANOLUC-p38 alpha fusion was rapidly released through lOmin chemical cleavage of the chloroalkane linker with lOmM of sodium hydrosulfite (PBI-5131 is a chloroalkane cleavable linker). The released NANOLUC-p38 alpha (+PBI4834/+PBI5131) and control (- drug) were detected with NANOGLO luciferase detection reagent. Although the pull-down efficiency with PBI-4834 (carbamate linker) is significantly higher compared to PBI-5131, this example demonstrates the benefit of rapid release using chemical cleavage for minimizing background leading to significant increase in specific capture (Figure 7). Example 6 The following provides synthesis schemes for exemplary compounds that find use in embodiments of the present invention. 50 mg of methotrexate hydrate was stirred in 3 mL of DMF and treated with ED AC (63 mg, 330 umol) and triethylamine (77 uL, 550 umol). After 10 min, 12-chloro-3, 6-dioxododecylamine hydrocholide (21.5 mg, 83 umol) was added. After 3 h, the product was isolated by preparative HPLC (2->50% MeCN in 0.1% aqueous formic acid). The appropriate fractions were concentrated and lyophilized to yield an orange solid. Calculated forM+H: 660.3; found 660.7 Methotrexate pentylamine intermediate To a mixture of methotrexate hydrate (50 mg, 110 umol), ED AC (63 mg, 330 umol) and triethylamine (77 uL, 550 umol) in 2 mL of DMF, N-Boc cadaverine (22 mg, 110 umol) was added. The reaction was stirred for 90 min then quenched with 2 mL of 1 Ν HC1 diluted with water and subjected to preparative HPLC (20->50% MeCN in 0.1% aqueous formic acid). The appropriate fractions were concentrated and lyophilized to yield the desired product. Calculated for Μ+Η: 639.3; found 639.5. Methotrexate N-Boc-cadaverine adduct (24 mg, 38 umol) was treated with 4 Μ HC1 in dioxane (0.5 mL) at RT.

Example 7 Endogenous target pull-down (PBI-5015) The following example demonstrates the ability of the chloroalkane-drug conjugate to isolate, e.g., pull-down, endogenous targets from cells. ΗΕΚ293 cells were plated into wells of a 6-well plate (2.5x105 cells/well). 48 hours post plating, a final concentration of lOuM of Methotrexate chloroalkane (PBI-5015) was added to 2 wells while control cells were not treated with the drug conjugate. Following equilibrium binding for 2h, the media was removed, and the cells quickly washed with PBS and lysed in detergent-based lysis buffer for lOmin. Cell lysates were then transferred to an Eppendorf® tube containing 12.5ul of settled paramagnetic HaloTag® protein beads and incubated with shaking for 15min. Following binding, the unbound fraction was removed, the HaloTag paramagnetic beads washed 3χ, and the captured targets specifically released from the beads by competition with 150μΜ unconjugated methotrexate for 60 mins. The released targets were subjected to mass spec analysis as well as western blot analysis using an anti-DHFR antibody (Sigma). Results in Figure 1A demonstrate that DHFR, a known target of methotrexate, can be specifically isolated, e.g., pulled down from the cells. Furthermore, although the expression level of DHFR in the cells is very low (not detected in lysate by western blot analysis), it was still efficiently captured as indicated by the western blot analysis (Figure 8Α) and mass spec analysis (Figure 8Β). In addition, the mass spec data indicates that with this method has very low background.

Synthesis of HaloTag® Protein Paramagnetic Beads To create the HaloTag® protein paramagnetic beads, HaloTag® protein was immobilized onto the paramagnetic STEP4 resin through an N-terminal cysteine. HaloTag® protein was expressed in E.coli as a HisTag-miniGroEL-HaloTag® fusion with a TEV protease recognition site (EDLYFQC) between HaloTag® protein and the miniGroEL sequences. The fusion was purified using HisTag and then cleaved with the TEV protease in the presence of 2mM TCEP to expose an N-terminal reduced cysteine. The reactive cyano group on the STEP4 resin reacts with the reduced N-terminal cysteine to form a very stable bond resulting with the HaloTag® protein beads. Example 10 The following example demonstrates the minimal impact of the chloroalkane modification on permeability and potency of the tethered bioactive agent. ΗΕΚ293 cells were plated in a 96-well plate at lxl05cell/ml in DMEM + 10% serum, and 24 hours later, the media was replaced with serum free DMEM media. Κ562 cells were plated in serum free RPMI 1640 media into wells of a 96-well plate at 2χ105 cells/ml. Cells were treated with serial dilutions of SAHA or PBI-5040 (SAHA-chloroalkane) for 2 hours and then tested for intracellular HD AC activity using the non-lytic HDAC-Glo™ Eli assay (Promega Corporation) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The results in Figure 10 indicate similar inhibition of HD AC activity by SAHA and PBI-5040. The ~2-fold reduction in SAHA potency due to the chloroalkane modification indicates minimal impact of the chloroalkane on cellular permeability or potency. Example 11 The following example demonstrates the ability of a chloroalkane-conjugated drug to pull- down endogenous targets from cells including low abundance and low affinity targets. ΗΕΚ293 cells were plated in 100mm dishes at 2χ105 cells/ml. Forty-eight hours post plating, a final concentration of 20uM SAHA-chloroalkane (PBI-5040) was added to 3 of the dishes (lx 107 cells/dish ), while 3 other dishes were not treated with the conjugated drug (control). Following equilibrium binding for 2 hours, the media was removed, the cells quickly washed with PBS, lysed in a detergent-based lysis buffer for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 3000xg for 1 minute. The cleared lysates were than added to 75ul of settled paramagnetic HALOTAG beads and incubated with shaking for 15 minutes. Following binding, the unbound fraction was removed, the HALOTAG paramagnetic beads were washed 3χ (wash buffer- 50mM HEPES ρΗ7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.01% IGEPAL), and the captured targets specifically released from the beads by competition with 400μΜ unconjugated SAHA for 60 minutes. The released targets were subjected to mass spec analysis (Fig 1 IB) as well as western blot analysis (Fig 1-Α) with anti HDAC1 antibody (ABCAM); anti HDAC2 antibody (ABCAM); anti HDAC6 antibody (Millipore); anti HDAC3 antibody (Thermo Fisher) and anti HDAC8 antibody (Rockland / Promega). The results in Figure 11 indicate that all known targets of SAHA, including low affinity target (HDAC8) and low abundance target (HDAC3), can be specifically pull down from the cells using an embodiment of the present invention. Example 12 The following example demonstrates the effect of the linkage method (chloroalkane or biotin) on drug potency. Κ562 cells were plated in serum free RPMI 1640 media into wells of a 96-well plate at 2χ105 cells/ml. Cells were then treated with serial dilution of SAHA, PBI-5040 (SAHA-chloroalkane) or PBI 5475 (SAHA -biotin) for 2 hours and then tested for intracellular HD AC activity using the non-lytic HD AC- Glo™ I/II assay (Promega Corporation) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The results in Figure 12 indicate a ~2 fold reduction in potency for the chloroalkane modification compared to a ~16 fold reduction in potency for the biotin modification. These results further demonstrate the minimal impact of the chloroalkane linkage on cellular permeability or potency when used with a bioactive agent. Example 13 The following example demonstrates the highly efficient pull-down mediated by the chloroalkane linkage compared to a biotin linkage in an embodiment of the present invention. Κ562 cells were plated in 150mm dishes at 5χ107 cells/dish. A final concentration of 20uM SAHA chloroalkane (PBI-5040) or PBI-5475 (SAHA-biotin) was added to 2 dishes of cells while 2 other dishes of cells were not treated with the conjugated drug (control). Following equilibrium binding of 2 hours, the media was removed, the cells quickly washed with PBS and lysed in detergent-based lysis buffer for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 3000xg for 1 minute. The cleared lysates treated with PBI-5040, as well as the cleared lysates of the control cells, were added to 75ul of settled paramagnetic HALTOG beads. The cleared lysates of the cells treated with PBI-5475, as well as the cleared lysate of the control cells, were added to 75ul of settled paramagnetic Streptavidin beads (GE). Following 15 minutes of binding, the unbound fraction was removed, beads were washed 3χ, and the captured targets specifically released from the beads by competition with 400μΜ unconjugated SAHA for 60 minutes. The released targets were subjected to western blot analysis (Figure 13) with anti HDAC1 antibody (ABCAM); anti HDAC2 antibody (ABCAM); anti HDAC6 antibody (Millipore); anti HDAC3 antibody (Thermo Fisher) and anti HDAC8 antibody (Rockland / Promega). The results in Figure 13 indicate that while all known targets of SAHA, including a low affinity target (HDAC8) and a low abundance target (HDAC3), were specifically pulled down by SAHA-chloroalkane, only HDAC6 was pulled down by SAHA-biotin. These results further demonstrate the advantages of the chloroalkane linkage for pull-down of endogenous targets in embodiments of the present invention.
