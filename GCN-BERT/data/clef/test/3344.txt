A GREEN TOILET SYSTEM AND METHOD FIELD The present disclosure relates to the field of engineering. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to sanitation or sewage treatment. BACKGROUND Sanitation is the hygienic means of promoting health through prevention of human contact with the hazards of wastes as well as the treatment and proper disposal of sewage or wastewater. Hazards can be physical, microbiological, biological or chemical agents of disease. Environmental sanitation is a major public health issue in the developing countries. Lack of toilets, in particular, lack of environmental friendly toilets is one of the critical reasons for poor sanitation in the developing countries. Conventionally, toilets that are used in rural areas of a developing country are pit-toilets which are unhealthy means of disposal of waste. Even in urban areas, conventionally, a lot of water is wasted while disposing solid waste and also lack of public toilets makes sanitation a challenge. Cost of constructing a toilet, continuous supply of water, area required to construct a toilet and separating waste water from the solid waste are some challenges in conventional toilet systems. These hurdles lead to open defecation and open urination with the associated serious public health issues. Also, depleting ground water table and deteriorating ground water quality are threatening the sustainability of both urban and rural water supply in many developing countries. Hence there is a need for an environment friendly toilet system and method that is cost effective, provides real time treatment of waste water and generates make up water, requires less area for its construction and does not dispose the waste water with solid waste. OBJECTS Some of the objects of the system of the present disclosure which at least one embodiment herein satisfies are as follows: It is an object of the present disclosure to ameliorate one or more problems of the prior art or to at least provide a useful alternative.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The disclosure will now be described with reference to the accompanying embodiments which do not limit the scope and ambit of the disclosure. The description provided is purely by way of example and illustration. The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained with reference to the non-limiting embodiments in the following description. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein. The present disclosure discloses a system and a method of an environment friendly toilet, hereinafter referred as “green toilet”. Conventionally, a lot of water is wasted while disposing the solid waste which results in ground water depletion and deteriorates ground water quality. The green toilet system described in the present disclosure is exerted to reuse water that is drained and provides a unique solution of segregating solid waste from waste water. The green toilet system and process is described in detail and can be understood when read in conjunction with Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively. Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary block diagram of an environment friendly toilet system 10, hereinafter also referred as “the green toilet system” or “the system”, comprising a toilet housing 50 that consists of a pair of urinal 52-A, 52-Β, a water closet 54 and a storage tank 78, a plurality of first conduits 56, a receiving module 58, a first polymer dispenser (not shown in the figure), a second polymer dispenser (not shown in the figure), a second conduit 64, a filtration module 66, a third conduit 68, a water treatment module 70, an oxygenator (not shown in the figure), a fourth conduit 72, a pump 74, a fifth conduit 80, a sixth conduit 82 and an RO (reverse osmosis) treatment chamber 84. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the green toilet system 10 comprising the toilet housing 50 may need water for activities such as hand wash, body parts washing, toilet cleaning, flush, and the like. In Figure 1 of the present disclosure, solid waste and waste water flows from the urinals 52-Α, 52-B and the water closet 54 through the plurality of first conduits 56 and enters the receiving module 58 which is provided operatively below the urinals 52-A, 52-B and the water closet 54. The plurality of first conduits 56 connects the toilet housing 50 with the receiving module 58 such that the toilet housing 50 and the receiving module 58 have fluid communication between them. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the conduit may be a pipe, duct, channel, tube and the like. The number of first conduit does not limit the scope of the present disclosure and therefore, one or more than one first conduit can be used in the system 10. Whenever the urinals 52-Α, 52-B and/or the water closet 54 of the toilet housing 50 is used, the waste water and/or the solid waste gets transferred to the receiving module 58 and gets collected in the receiving module 58 where the solid waste and/or waste water undergo various treatments. A controller (not shown in the figure), controlled from a remote location from the toilet housing, is configured to activate the first polymer dispenser. The first polymer dispenser is configured to dispense a first polymer into the receiving module 58. The first treatment that the mixture of solid waste and waste water undergoes is the segregation of the waste water from the solid waste, which is achieved by means of the first polymer (not shown exclusively in the figure). The first polymer is introduced in the receiving module 58 immediately after the solid waste and waste water enters the receiving module 58 and causes a reaction in the receiving module 58 resulting in the separation of solid and liquid particles. Later, after the segregation of the solid waste and waste water, the controller is used to activate the second polymer dispenser. The second polymer dispenser is configured to dispense a second polymer into the receiving module 58. The second polymer (not shown exclusively in the figure) is introduced in the receiving module 58, and is configured to aggregate all the solid particles that are present in the receiving module 58, thereby densifying the segregated solid waste. The separated water flows out of the receiving module 58 through the second conduit 64, and the aggregated solid waste is retained in the receiving module 58. In one embodiment, the solid waste is aggregated in form of layers by the second polymer. In another embodiment, the solid waste that remains in the receiving module 58 is made inert by the second polymer and can be further disposed to a landfill (not disclosed in the figures). The second conduit 64 carries the separated water and disposes the separated water in the filtration module 66. The first polymer and the second polymer are synthetic polymers (man-made polymers) and in an embodiment of the present disclosure, the first polymer and the second polymer may be selected from the Polyacrylamides family. In another embodiment, receiving module 58 may accumulate the inert solid waste in a cartridge (not shown in the figure), which can be present inside the receiving module 58 such that the replacement time of the cartridge is depended upon usage cycle of the toilet housing 50. In the filtration module 66, the separated water flows through a filtration media 67 to filter water as the filtration media 67 is effective in filtering solid particles/pollutants such as suspended solids, phosphorus and the like, from the water. In one embodiment, sensors are made available inside the filtration module 66 to keep a check on the condition of the filtration media 67. In another embodiment, the filtration media 67 may be a bed of sand, peat, foam, crushed glass, crushed granite and the like. Filtration module 66 also treats the colour and odour of the filtered water. The filtered water is then transferred from the filtration module 66 to the water treatment module 70 by the means of the third conduit 68. After removal of the solid and suspended solids from the separated waste water, the filtered water undergoes further treatment in the water treatment module 70 which receives oxygen from the oxygenator (not exclusively shown in figure 1) and provides the oxygen to the filtered water to maintain the pre-determined oxygen level, to balance the COD (chemical oxygen demand) and BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) levels of the water and to also destroy bacteria. The water treatment module 70 also discharges all the gaseous exhaust present inside the water treatment module 70. In another embodiment, a sample of the waste water can be collected from the water treatment module 70 for testing purposes. The treated water flows out of the water treatment module 70 via the fourth conduit 72 and is pumped by the means of the pump 74, into the storage tank 78 where the treated water is stored for toilet use. The storage tank 78 is located operatively at an upper location in the toilet housing 50 for easy flow of water from the storage tank 78 to the utilities of the toilet housing 50. In one embodiment, sensors are provided in the storage tank 78 to keep a check on the water level in the storage tank 78. The treated water can be used for various toilet activities such as, cleaning toilet, cistern for flushing, hand wash, body wash, and the like. Therefore, the treated water from the storage tank 78 is transferred directly via the fifth conduit 80 for the purpose of flushing, toilet cleaning and the like, which does not need any further treatment of water. For activities such as body wash and the like, highly treated water is required and thus, the treated water from the storage tank 78 is also carried by the sixth conduit 82, but to the reverse osmosis treatment chamber 84 where the treated water undergoes a reverse osmosis treatment (RO treatment) which further purifies the water for personal use, such as for hand/body part washing. In yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, the sensors are provided at various places in the system 10 including, but not limited to, the gates/doors (not shown in the figure), the receiving module 58, the filtration module 66, the water treatment module 70 and the storage tank 78. The controller is configured to operate a valve to permit flow of oxygenated filtrate, directly from the storage tank 78 to utilities of the toilet housing 50 or via the reverse osmosis treatment chamber 84 that purifies the oxygenated filtrate. In still another embodiment, the green toilet system 10 includes an analyser (not shown in the figure) remotely located from the controller. The analyser is configured to analyse signals received from various sensors fitted to the receiving module 58, the filtration module 66, the water treatment module 70, the storage tank 78, the toilet housing 50, the urinals 52-Α,52-Β and the water closet 54. The analyser is further configured to analyse the plurality of signals and automate the function of the system 10, particularly to provide recycled water in the form of the oxygenated filtrate to the toilet housing 50 and/or fresh water from an external water supply system (not shown in the figure) if the need so arises. In another embodiment, a green toilet network can be created, comprising a plurality of systems housed in a plurality of housings, wherein the plurality of systems can be configured to generate signals via a plurality of sensors attached to the systems and can be further configured to analyse the generated signals via at least one analyser to control the operation of each of the systems connected by a wire, wirelessly or partially by wire and wirelessly. The environment friendly toilet system 10 is completely IT integrated and enabled, and contains the following features: (i) Control of opening and closing of door for usage, (ii) mobile based app for opening of toilet door, (iii) status of function of toilet ( occupied, vacant, out of order) information will be made available, (iv) unmanned toilet, (ν) selfcleaning of toilet, (vi) status and control of water level in the tank, (vii) the condition of the filtration media, (viii) status of receiving module etc. The environment friendly toilet system 10 disclosed in the present disclosure is therefore highly secure and safe and is easily accessible. The environment friendly toilet system 10 disclosed in the present disclosure reuses and recycles waste water thus resulting in saving a lot of water which gets wasted in a conventional toilet system and hence makes it more cost-effective. The storage tank 78 may be connected to an auxiliary tank (not shown in the figure) or supply of water for topping up water if there is need for such topping up for the toilet of this disclosure. The green toilet system 10 of this invention replenishes the water itself by use and there is no need for an external supply of water after an initial seeding of water to run the green toilet system 10. Alternative embodiments of the present disclosure includes the receiving module 58 and the filtration media 67 that can be made of a flexible material, and the sensors attached to the receiving module 58 and the filtration module 66. Sensor attached to the receiving module 58 reveals the status of the receiving module 58 or the line within the receiving module 58, which if states that the receiving module 58 or the line within the receiving module 58 is full, can be removed by an automated system (not shown in the figure) and further can be replaced by a fresh receiving module 58 or a receiving module liner. The sensors also facilitate disposal of the solid waste stored in the receiving module or receiving module line. The sensors attached in the filtration module 66 reveals the condition of the filtration media 67, which if states that the filtration media is not efficient anymore, can be removed by an automated system and further can be replaced by a fresh filtration media. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, every unit is automated and is operable automatically by the central server or a local node or both. The automated units can be controlled on the basis of time or on the basis of their functionality by the controller and the analyser. In one embodiment, there may be an array of receiving modules 58 or filtration media 67, which may be mounted on conveyer belts. In one embodiment, there will be a method of indexing the receiving modules or filtration media mounted on the conveyer belts. The solid waste may also be dried and used to generate energy by the use of its calorific value. Similarly, the solid waste from the receiving module and the residue from the filtration unit may be combined together to form a single solid waste mass either for disposal, for generating energy or as a fertilizer. Figure 2 illustrates a flowchart of the process of an environment friendly toilet system 100 that consists of a urinal 104 and a water closet 108, a receiving module 112, a first polymer dispenser 116, a second polymer dispenser 120, a filtration module 124, a water treatment module 128, an oxygenator 126, a gaseous exhaust chamber 130, a pump 132, a storage tank 136, and an RO (reverse osmosis) treatment chamber 148. In Figure 2 of the present disclosure, solid waste and waste water flows from the urinal 104 and the water closet 108 through a plurality of conduits and enters the receiving module 112 also called as chamber box 112 which is provided operatively below the urinal 104 and the water closet 108. The plurality of conduits connects the urinal 104 and the water closet 108 with the receiving module 112. The solid waste and the waste water collected in the receiving module 112 undergo various treatments. The first treatment that the mixture of solid waste and waste water undergoes is the segregation of the waste water from the solid waste, which is achieved by means of the first polymer dispensed by the first polymer dispenser 116. The first polymer is introduced in the receiving module 112 immediately after the solid waste and waste water enters the receiving module 112 and causes a reaction in the receiving module 112 resulting in the separation of solid and liquid particles. Later, the second polymer dispenser 120 dispenser a second polymer into the receiving module 112, wherein the second polymer aggregates all the solid particles that are present in the receiving module 112, thereby densifying the segregated solid waste. Further, the separated water flows out of the receiving module 112 through a conduit and the aggregated solid waste is retained in the receiving module 112. In one embodiment, the solid waste that remains in the receiving module 112 is made inert by the second polymer and can be further disposed to a landfill (not disclosed in the figures). The conduit carries the separated waste water and disposes the separated waste water in the filtration module 124. In the filtration module 124, the separated waste water flows through a filtration media (not shown in the figure 2) to filter water as the filtration media is effective in removing solid particles/pollutants such as suspended solids, phosphorus etc. Filtration module 124 also treats the colour and odour of the filtered water. The filtered water is then transferred from the filtration module 124 to the water treatment module 128 by the means of a conduit. After removal of the solid and suspended solids from the segregated waste water, the filtered water undergoes further treatment in the water treatment module 128 which provides oxygen to the waste water by the means of the oxygenator 126 to maintain the pre-determined oxygen level, to balance the COD (chemical oxygen demand) and BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) levels of the water and to also destroy bacteria. The water treatment module 128 also discharges all the gaseous exhaust present inside the water treatment module 128 in the gaseous exhaust chamber 130. The treated water flows out of the water treatment module 128 via a conduit and is pumped by the means of the pump 132, into the storage tank 136 where the treated water is stored for toilet use. The storage tank 136 is located above the urinal 104 and the water closet 108 for easy flow of water from the storage tank 136 to the urinal 104 and the water closet 108. The treated water from the storage tank 136 is transferred directly into the urinal 104 and the water closet 108 via a cistern 144 and a water tank 140 for the purpose of flushing and toilet cleaning respectively. For activities such as body part wash, hand wash and the like, highly treated water is required and thus, the treated water from the storage tank 136 is also transferred to the toilet housing via the reverse osmosis treatment chamber 148 where the treated water undergoes a reverse osmosis treatment (RO treatment) which further purifies the water and stores the water in another water tank 152 for personal use.
