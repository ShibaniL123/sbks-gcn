Example Compound 57
2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(pyridin-3-yl)acetate
2-(pyridin-3-yl)acetic acid hydrochloride (32.5 mg, 0.2 mmol) was suspended in DCM (4 mL) under Argon, cooled to 0 °C and added trimethylamine (26 µL, 0.2 mmol). After 30 minutes a clear solution is observed and EDCI (35.9 mg, 0.2 mmol) and DMAP (4.8 mg, 0.04 mmol) followed by N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (44.1 mg, 0.2 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The mixture was left stirring overnight and then diluted with water and extracted 3 times with DCM. The organic phase was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. Purification by column chromatography (5% MeOH in DCM) yielded 60.6 mg of the title compound (92%).
