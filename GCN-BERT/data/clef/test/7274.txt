(Reference Example 5) Synthesis of 4-(2-Phenylethynyl)Furoxan Compound Using 4-Fluorofuroxan Compound as Starting Compound
Tetrahydrofuran (0.25 mL) was added to 4-fluoro-3-(4-methylphenyl)furoxan (19.4 mg, 0.1 mmol). After addition of 1-phenyl-2-trimethylsilylacetylene (25.6 μL, 0.13 mmol) to the solution, a 1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran (20 μL, 0.02 mmol) was added thereto. After stirring the mixture at room temperature for 90 minutes, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain 3-(4-methylphenyl)-4-(2-phenylethynyl)furoxan (17.3 mg, 63% yield).
