(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-[(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)amino]-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
A nitrogen sparged solution of (2S,3S,4S,5S)-ethyl 4-amino-3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Example 7B, 56 mg, 0.140 mmol) and 3-bromo-5-(tert-butyl)-2-methoxypyridine (68.3 mg, 0.280 mmol) was added to a nitrogen sparged suspension of 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthalene (9.58 mg, 0.015 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (6.40 mg, 6.99 μmol) and cesium carbonate (137 mg, 0.419 mmol) in toluene (0.3 mL). The reaction was heated at 110° C. in an aluminum block for 16 hours. The crude material was concentrated and loaded onto a 12 g silica gel column and eluted with 0-30% ethyl acetate/heptanes over 40 minutes to give (2S,3S,4S,5S)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-4-((5-(tert-butyl)-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)amino)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (16 mg, 0.028 mmol, 20.30% yield). MS (APCI+) m/z 610 (M+H)+. The material was taken up in methanol (1 mL) and to the resulting solution was added a 1 M solution of lithium hydroxide (0.284 mL, 0.284 mmol) in water. The reaction was warmed at 45° C. for 4 hours. The solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen and the reaction was neutralized with 1 N aqueous HCl. The crude material was taken up in dichloromethane and purified using a 12 g silica gel cartridge with an ethyl acetate/ethanol/heptanes solvent system and then purified again using reverse phase HPLC with an acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid method to give (2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-(tert-butyl)-4-((5-(tert-butyl)-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)amino)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (4.8 mg, 8.96 μmol, 31.6% yield).
