Method for obtaining microbial secondary metabolites or derivatives thereof by heterologous expression of at least one synthetase of said secondary metabolites in filamentous fungi The present invention relates to a method for obtaining microbial secondary metabolites according to claim 1 , an expression cassette according to claim 16, a plasmid vector according to claim 17, cyclodepsipeptides according to claim 18, an expression host according to claim 19 and a chimeric cyclodepsipeptide synthetase according to claim 20. Description Recent genome mining efforts have uncovered that the genomes of filamentous fungi encode an unexpected rich repertoire of low molecular weight compounds with commercial relevance. These natural products known as secondary metabolites include nonribosomal peptides, polyketides and lipopeptides with pharmacological impact. However, most of the genes involved in secondary metabolism pathways are not expressed under standard laboratory or industrial conditions, what hampers application of these natural products. Different strategies based on molecular factors and cultivation methods have thus been undertaken. However, there are still major obstacles to overcome such as low production rates. The present invention describes thus a novel approach for synthesizing microbial secondary metabolites or derivatives thereof, in particular cyclodepsipeptides. The present method comprises the step of heterologous expression of at least one synthetase of said secondary metabolite in at least one filamentous fungus. The filamentous fungi are preferably selected from the group of Aspergillus sp., Trichoderma sp., Penicillum sp., Fusarium sp. and Rhizopus spp. In particular preferred expression hosts are Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus nidulans, Trichoderma reesei, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizopus oryzae, Penicillium chrysogenum. In an embodiment of the present method the synthetase is selected from the group of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), polyketide synthetase (PKS), terpene cyclases or hybrides thereof. It is in particular preferred if the synthetase is a cyclodepsipeptidsynthetase, in particular a cyclodepsipeptidsynthetase of the iterative type. For example the synthetase is a cyclodepsipeptidsynthetase selected from the group containing Enniatin, PF1022, Beauvericin and Bassianolide synthetase. It is in general also possible and conceivable to express further NRPS in one of the mentioned fungi, such as NRPS of epothilone, actinomycin, daptomycin, valinomycin, fungisporin or bleomycin. In another variant it is desirable to express PKS systems, such as the one for erythromycin, doxycycline or geldanamycin in the fungal expression host. The native cyclodepsipeptide synthetase typically comprises two modules: module 1 for integrating a D-hydroxycarboxylic acid, module 2 for integrating an L-amino acid and additionally a third PCP and C-domain (module 3) for determining the ring size n, typically n = 6 and 8. A typical example of a cyclodepsipeptide synthetase, such as Enniatin Synthetase is shown in Figure 1 . Enniatin is a hexacyclodepsipeptide consisting of 3 D-hydroxycarboxylic acids and 3 L-amino acids. Main products are Enniatin A, B, and C with Enniatin A comprising 3x D-Hiv, 3x L-lle, Enniatin B comprising 3x D-Hiv, 3x L-Val and Enniatin C comprising 3x D-Hiv, 3x L-Leu. The N-atom is in any case methylated. Enniatin is synthesized by a Enniatin Synthetase which is present in Fusarium sp., Vertcillium hemipterigenum, Halosarpheia sp. In case of Enniatin B module 1 is specific for D- hydroxyvalerate, module 2 is specific for L-valine and PCP/C-domain (module 3) determines the ring number n=6. The PF1022 synthetase, which is for instant present in Mycelia sterilia, comprises module 1 specific for D-phenyllactate and/or D-lactate, module 2 specific for L-leucine and a PCP/C- domain (module 3) determining a ring number n = 8. The Beauvericin synthetase, for instance from Beauveria bassiana strain ATCC7159, comprise module 1 specific for D-hydroxyvalerate, module 2 specific for L-phenylalanine and PCP/C-domain (module 3) determining the ring number being n=6. In another preferred embodiment a chimeric cyclodepsipeptide synthetase is used, wherein the synthetase is made of modules and/or domains of at least two different cyclodepsipeptide synthetases. It is preferred if at least one module is chosen from a first cyclodepsipeptide synthetase and and at least a second module is chosen from another cyclodepsipeptide synthetase. For example, it is possible that the synthetase comprises module 1 of one cyclodepsipeptide synthetase and modules 2 and 3 of another cyclodepsipeptide synthetase. Preferred embodiments of such hybrid or chimeric cyclodepsipeptide synthetases can have the following arrangement: a) module 1 from PF1022 Synthetase specific for D-Phenyllactate/ D-Lactate (for example from Mycelia sterilia), module 2 and PCP/C-domain (module 3) from Enniatin Synthetase specific for L-Valin and n= 6 (for example from Fusarium oxysporum; see Figure 14, Seq ID No1 ), or b) module 1 from PF1022 Synthetase specific for D-Phenyllactate/ D-Lactate, module 2 and PCP/C-domain (module 3) from Beauvericin Synthetase specific for L-Phenylalanine and n = 6 (see Figure 18, Seq ID No 2). In general any other module/domain combination is possible. For example it is conceivable and possible that module 1 is chosen from an Enniatin or Beauvericin Synthetase and module 2 and PCP/C-domain (module 3) are chosen from PF1022 Synthetase. However, a hybrid cyclodepsipeptide synthetase system comprising module 1 from beauvericin synthetase and module 2 and PCP/C-domain (module 3) from bassianolide synthetase as the synthetase system, which has been shown to be expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is already known and is hereby exempted (Yu et al., ChemComm., 2013, 49:6176-6178). This specific chimeric cyclodepsipeptide synthetase is however not exempted from expression in a filamentous fungus. In a further embodiment of the present invention an inducible expression system integrated into the chromosome of the at least one filamentous fungus is used for heterologous expression of at least one synthetase. Such an inducible expression system is independent on the metabolism. Also constitutive expression is in general possible. In a variant the expression system comprises at least one expression cassette consisting of at least three modules. The expression cassette may comprise a first module for constitutive expression of the Tetracycline dependent transactivator rtTA2, a second module (Tet-on system) harboring the rtTA2-dependent promoter for inducible expression of the at least one secondary metabolite synthetase and a third module for integrating the cassette into the fungal genome by homologous recombination. In a most preferred embodiment the first module comprises constitutive promoter PgpdA - rtTA - terminator TcgrA, the second module comprises operator sequence tet07 - (seven copies of tetO sequence) - minimal promoter Pmin - secondary metabolite synthase (esyn l )-terminator trpC (with tet07::Pmin as rtTA2S-M2 dependent promoter) and the third module comprises pyrG* for homologous integration of the plasmid at the pyrG locus. After transformation of the plasmid vector comprising said expression cassette into a preferable protease-negative (prtT ) and uracil-auxotroph (pyrG ) A. niger strain, uridine-prototroph transformants were selected, purified and subjected to Southern analysis. The expression cassette is exemplarily shown in Figure 2. Other selection systems may be based on dominant (antibiotics such as hygromycin or phleomycin), auxotrophic or nutritional selection markers established for filamentous fungi. At least one copy of the expression cassette is integrated into the fungal genome. It is possible that multiple expression cassettes are present in the fungal genome. In another variant of the present invention the expression cassette comprises further genes encoding for biosynthetic enzymes of metabolic precursors or metabolic intermediates, in particular dehydrogenases. For example, using dehydrogenases for transforming amino acids to hydroxycarboxylic acids, which are expressed constitutively, allows an independent synthesis of different hydroxycarboxylic acids. Said further genes may also not be part of the expression cassette and may be expressed from a different chromosomal location by using at least one constitutive, inducible or repressible promotor. The transformed fungal expression host is grown in a suitable culture medium. The culture media used for heterologous expression of the synthetase may comprise talcum, titanic, silica or aluminium oxide particles, wherein talcum particles are in particular preferred. These particles support formation of smaller fungal pellets. The culture media comprises furthermore glucose, trace elements, casamino acids, MgS04, yeast extracts. In one variant of the present method the glucose concentration is 1 -10%, preferably 2.5 to 7.5 %, mostly preferably 5%. It is also preferred if the culture media used for heterologous expression of the synthetase comprises 5 - 50 mM, preferably 10 - 30 mM, most preferably 20 mM of at least one hydroxycarboxylic acid or derivatives thereof (for example 20 mM D-hydroxyvalerate) and 10 - 30 mM, preferably 15-25 mM, most preferably 20 mM of at least one amino acid or a derivative thereof (for example L-valine). It is in general also possible to replace the hydroxycarboxylic acid by their corresponding esters, by O-acylated hydroxycarboxylc acids and their corresponding esters. The methyl esters are thereby preferred. The induction of the expression occurs by adding the appropriate inducer, for example 5- 200 μg/ml, in particular 10 - 100 μg ml, most preferably 10 - 50 μg ml doxycycline or other inducers such as tetracyclin or derivatives thereof. The addition of 10 μg ml doxycycline is in particular preferred. The induction is preferably carried out in the exponential phase, in particular in batch or fed batch culture. The inducer can be added once or repeatedly. In a further embodiment of the present invention the culture media used for heterologous expression of the synthetase comprises at least one D- or L- hydroxycarboxylic acid (or racemic mixtures thereof) of the general formulae (I) R -CHOH-C02H, wherein R can be selected from a group comprising - substituted and non-substituted CrC5o-alkyl, substituted and non-substituted C2-C5o- alkenyl, substituted and non-substituted C2-C5o-alkinyl, substituted and non-substituted C3- Cio-cycloalkyl, substituted and non-substituted Cs-Cy-cycloalkenyl, which in each case can be interrupted by one or more oxygen atoms, sulphur atoms, substituted or mono-substituted nitrogen atoms, double bonds and/or by one or more groups of the type -C(0)0-, -OC(O)-, - C(O)-, -NHC(0)0-, -OC(0)NH- and/or -OC(0)0-, or - aryl, heteroaryl, -CH2-aryl or -CH2-heteroaryl, wherein aryl and heteroaryl are substituted or non-substituted. Thus, the hydroxycarboxylic acids may be fed to the culture media during growth of the expression host. It is however also possible that at least some of the hydroxycarboxylic acids are synthesized by the expression host itself. The moiety R can be selected from a group comprising substituted and non-substituted Cr Ci2-alkyl, substituted and non-substituted C3-C7-cycloalkyl and substituted and non-substituted C2-Ci2-alkenyl and substituted and non-substituted C6-Ci2 Aryl, in particular -C6H5.

Examples for the above substituted alkenylgroups comprise styrolyl, 3-chlor-propen-1 -yl, 3- chlor-buten-1 -yl, 3-methoxy-propen-2-yl, 3-phenyl-buten-2-yl, 1 -cyano-buten-3-yl and alike. The term„alkinyl" as used herein relates to a moiety of the formulae R-C≡C-, in particular to a C2-C5o-Alkinyl". Examples for C2-C5o-alkinyle comprise ethinyl, propinyl, 2-butinyl, 2-pentinyl, 3-pentinyl, 2-hexinyl, 3-hexinyl, 4-hexinyl, 2-heptinyl, 3-heptinyl, 4-heptinyl, 5-heptinyl, octinyl, noninyl, decinyl, undecinyl, dodecinyl, as well as di- and tri-ines of straight or branched alky chains. The term "oxo" relates to a carbon atom, which is connected with an oxygen atom via a double bond whereby a keto or an aldehyde group is formed. The term "protected oxo" relates to a carbon atom, which is substituted by two alkoxy groups or is connected twice with a substituted diol forming a non-cyclic or cyclic ketal group. The term„alkoxy" relates to moieties like methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, t- butoxy and alike. A preferred alkoxy group is methoxy. The term „C3-C7-cycloalkyl" comprises groups like cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl und cycloheptyl. The term „C5-C7-Cycloalkenyl "relates to a 1 ,2 oder 3- cyclopentenyl ring, a 1 ,2,3 oder 4-cyclohexenyl ring or a 1 ,2,3,4 or 5-cycloheptenylring. Preferably R is methyl, ethyl, -CH(CH3)2, propyl, isopropyl, -CH2-CH(CH3)2, butyl, isobutyl, tert.-butyl, -CH2-C(CH3)3, pentyl, hexyl, -CH2-C6H5, -CH2-CI, -CH2-Br, -CH2-F, -CH2-I, - CH2-N3, -CH2-C≡CH, -CH2CH=CH2CH3 or -CH2-cycloC3H5. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the culture media used for heterologous expression of the synthetase comprises at least one D- or L-amino acid of the general formulae (II) R2-CHNH2-C02H, wherein R2 can be selected from the group comprising - substituted and non-substituted CrC5o-alkyl, substituted and non-substituted C2-C5o- alkenyl, substituted and non-substituted C2-C5o-alkinyl, substituted and non-substituted C3- Cio-cycloalkyl, substituted and non-substituted Cs-Cy-cycloalkenyl, which in each case can be interrupted by one or more oxygen atoms, sulphur atoms, substituted or mono-substituted nitrogen atoms, double bonds and/or by one or more groups of the type -C(0)0-, -OC(O)-, - C(O)-, -NHC(0)0-, -OC(0)NH- and/or -OC(0)0- . In particular R2 is -CH2-C6H5 (phenyl), - CH2-CH(CH3)2, -CH2(CH3)2. Thus, the amino acid may be fed to the culture media during growth of the expression host. The feeding of an amino acid to the culture media has only supportive character and imprioves the overall expression yield. It is however also possible (and common) that at least some of the amino acids, preferably the naturally occurring amino acids, are synthesized by the expression host itself. Before transformation into the expression host the expression cassette is part of a plasmid vector. An example for such a plasmid vector comprising an expression cassette with an Enniatin synthase is shown in Figure 3. In this particular plasmid vector the Esyn gene (Enniatin synthetase) was cloned into Tet-On expression vector pVG2.2. Due to the large gene (9.4 kb) the cloning was performed by SLIC and homologous recombination method using pyrG as selection marker. However, other suitable cloning techniques are also applicable. The integration process of the expression cassette into the chromosome of fungi, such as A. niger \s exemplarily shown in Figure 4. Integration into the genome can be by homologous or heterologous recombination thus resulting in transformants carrying either single- or multi-copy integrations of the expression cassette. The present method allows for synthesizing at least one cyclodepsipeptide or a derivative thereof comprising the following general formulae (III) wherein R and R2 have the above meanings, R3 is a C1 -C3 alkyl moiety, in particular a -CH3 moiety and m = 3 or 4.

The used constructs carry a mutated pyrG gene (pyrG*), which allows the transformants to grow on medium lacking uridine only after uptake of the foreign DNA and after homologous recombination of pyrG* with a mutated pyrG gene version of A. niger (both mutations are at different locations). The enniatin synthetase was expressed under control of the Tet-On expression system. 3.

Experimental Procedure: The recipient strains (e.g. MA169.4 or AB1 .13) were cultured in 100 mL of CM (+10 mM uridine) at 30 °C and 120 rpm for 10-16 h. The mycelium was collected over a myracloth filter and washed once with SMC. Afterwards, the collected mycelium was added to the protoplastation solution (in 50 mL test tube) and incubated for 1 -1 .5 h at 37<C and 80 rpm. The protoplastation was confirmed by microscopy. Then, the protoplasts were collected through a myracloth filter and washed once with STC. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 10°C and 2000 rpm. The supernatant was decanted and the pellet gently resuspended in 1 mL of STC. The suspension was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 1 O'C and 6000 rpm. Again, the supernatant was decanted and the protoplasts resuspended in 1 mL of STC. The wash step was repeated twice. For each transformation, 100 μ\- of protoplasts, 10 μg plasmid pDS4.2 (in 10 μ\- H20) and 25 μ\- PEG buffer were added to a 50 mL test tube and mixed gently. 1 mL of PEG buffer was added and the tube mixed gently. After 5 min, 2 mL STC were added and mixed. 20-25 mL of top agar (cooled to 40 ^) were added to the mixture and poured onto the prepared transformation plates (0 15 cm). The plates were incubated at 30 'C for 3-4 days. Afterwards, the transformants were purified twice by streaking the spores on MM plates for colony isolation. The purified strains were analyzed by PCR and Southern Blot to confirm proper uptake and insertion of plasmid pDS4.2 into the genome of the recipient strains (see Figure 3). 5. Analytical Data for the Dependent Host Mutant DS3.1 Synthesizing Enniatin and Chloroenniatin (Figures 9 5 to 1 1 ) Cultivation Conditions: In order to identify the optimum condition for high yield production of enniatin a design -of- experiment approach was followed using the statistical software program MODE. The following parameters were varied in shake flask cultures of esyn l -expressing strain DS3.1 : medium composition (minimal medium, complete medium, Fusarium defined medium), amino acid (in particular L-valine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine) supplementation (0-20 mM), hydroxyacid (in particular D-Hiv) supplementation, 0-50 mM), glucose concentration (1 -5%), temperature, cuktivation time (1 -92 h) and Dox-concentration (0-20 μg ml). The parameters which mainly affected the enniatin yields were Dox and D-Hiv. The best cultivation medium identified contained 20 mM D-Hiv, 20 mM of one of the amino acids and 1 0 μg ml Dox. This medium composition improved the enniatin yield by a factor of 200. The enniatin yield was further increased about 4.75 fold by increasing the glucose concentration to 5% and by adding talcum. Enniatin Production Medium (EM): 20 ml_ ASP+N (50x) 1 00 mL glucose (50%) 2 mL MgS04 1 mL Vishniac 1 0 mL casamino acids (10%) 50 mL yeast extract (10%) 1 00 mL talc (10% in 50 mM Na-acetate buffer, pH 6.5) H20 to 1 L Strain DS3.1 (inoculation with 5 x 1 06 spores/mL) was cultivated in EM at 26 <C and 250 rpm. After 16 h, 10 mM or 20 mM D-Hiv, 20 mM l-Val and 1 0 μg mL Dox were added. The biomass was harvested after 92 h, lyophilized and enniatin B extracted with ethyl acetate. Analytical Methods (see Figures 5-9, 1 1 ): H-NMR and 3C-NMR spectra of enniatin B were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 NMR- spectrometer. Chemical shifts are given in δ-units (ppm) relative to the solvent signal. IR spectra were recorded on a Jasco FT-IR 4100 spectrometer. HRMS using ESI-technique was performed on a LTQ Orbitrap XL apparatus. The enniatin samples were directly infused into the mass spectrometer. Data for single-crystal structure determination of enniatin B were collected on an Oxford- Diffraction Xcalibur diffractometer, equipped with a CCD area detector Sapphire S and a graphite monochromator utilizing MoKQ radiation (λ = 0.71073 A). Suitable crystals were attached to glass fibers using fluoropolyalkylether oil (ABCR) and transferred to a goniostat where they were cooled to 150 K for data collection. Software packages used: CrysAlis CCD for data collection, CrysAlis Pro for cell refinement and data reduction. Results: Enniatin B: A production of enniatin B up to 1000 mg/L in strain DS3.1 could be obtained and verified by MRM-analysis. 393 mg of purified enniatin B could be isolated from the biomass (27.5 mg) and the broth of a 1 -L cultivation of transformant DS3.1 with supplementation of 10 mM d-Hiv and 20 mM l-Val to the medium. The isolated enniatin B was analyzed my MS, MS/MS, IR, NMR and X-Ray crystallography (see Figures 5-10): H-NMR (400.1 MHz, CDCI3) 5 = 5.1 1 (d, 3JH,H = 8.7 Hz, 3 H), 4.49 (d, 3JH,H = 9.7 Hz, 3 H), 3.1 1 (s, 9 H), 2.32-2,21 (m, 6 H), 1 .05-0.86 ppm (m, 36 H); 3C-NMR (100.6 MHz, CDCI3) δ = 170.25, 169.31 , 75.67, 63.20, 33.26, 29.91 , 27.92, 20.42, 19.34, 18.72, 18.50 ppm; IR (Neat): v = 2963.6-2873.4 (C-H, CH3 and CH), 1736.1 (C=0, ester), 1660.9 (C=0, amide), 1 183.6 (C-H, isopropyl) 101 1 .0 (CO, a-hydroxycarboxylic acid); ESI-HRMS: m/z calcd for [CasHsyNaOg+Na]*: 662.39870; found: 662.39859 Generation of Enniatin Analogs: Protocol for Feeding Experiments: Strain DS3.1 was cultivated under the same conditions as described above. Instead of D-Hiv, the corresponding hydroxy acid chlorolactate were added (10 mM final concentration). Feeding can be performed once or repeatedly at different time intervals during batch or fed batch cultivation. An equivalent approach provided Beauvericin (see Figure 1 1 a). B) Methods and Analytical Data for generation of Hybrid Synthetase 1 . Cloning Strategy for Generating Chimeric Synthetases (see Figure 12 - 14, 18): Expression plasmids using T7 promoter for heterologous expression in E. co//'were purchased from Merck Millipore. Protein expression of all hybrid genes coding for NRPS were cloned by insertion via restrictions sites into the high copy pRSF-Duetl plasmid. Combinatorial biosynthesis was performed by A-recombination mediated system. Sequences of desired domain or module were amplified via PCR (Q5-polymerase, High-Fidelity, New England Biolabs) and sub cloned into pRSF-Duetl . A selection marker (coding sequence for streptomycin resistance) which is needed after recombination was integrated at a single restriction site into the subcloned fragment. Positive clones were screened for streptomycin resistance and subsequently removed resistance by restriction and self-ligation of the flanking single cutter site. Electro competent E. coli BW251 13 cells were transformed with the desired vector with the original NRPS gene cultivated at 30 °C to save the heat labile plasmid plJ790 harbouring A- recombinase RED {gam, bet, exo) and single DNA protecting proteins. Recombinase expression was induced by addition of arabinose before E. coli BW251 13 cells were transformed with the module containing plasmid up to 70 base pairs were chosen as overlapping homologous region (modified after Gust et al. / Zhang et al. 1998). 2. Production of Chimeric Enniatins and Beauvericins with Chimeric Synthetases expressed in E. coli: Culture conditions and extraction E. coli BI21 gold cells were pre cultured over night at 37 <C in 20 ml of LB-medium at 200 rpm. Inoculation of main culture (50 ml LB-medium) with pre culture in the ration 1 :100 was incubated to an OD6oo of 0.6 at 37 <C and induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.25 mM (Carl Roth) and further incubated for protein expression and peptide production at 18 ° for 24-48 h 200 rpm. Cells were harvested and cell pellet was extracted with 5 ml of MeOH (technical grade). The suspension was sonified for 5 minutes and supernatant was evaporated. Analysis with HPLC-ESI-MS, HPLC-ESI-MS and Tandem MS (see Figures 15-17. 19-25) For complex analytics crude extracts were resolved in 200-500 μΙ MeOH (HPLC grade) and suspended solids were centrifuged at 14 000 x g. HPLC-ESI-MS was carried out for scanning new derivatives. For all measurements we used Agilent technologies regarding columns and HPLC/MS equipment (Eclipse Plus C18, 2.1 x 50 mm; UHPLC 1290 Infinity-Series, ESI-Triple- Quadrupol-MS, 6460 Series). By using a mobile phase system we added of 0.1 % of HCOOH in H20 (A) and ACN (B) with a gradient from 5 % to 100 % over 2.5 min and subsequently 100 % B for 5.5 more minutes. 1 .
