(E)-ethyl 2-((2-chlorobenzylidene)amino)acetate
A mixture of ethyl 2-aminoacetate hydrochloride (1.85 g, 13.25 mmol) and magnesium sulfate (3.19 g, 26.5 mmol) in dichloromethane (22.09 mL) (anhydrous) was treated with triethylamine (1.847 mL, 13.25 mmol), stirred for 30 minutes, and treated with the 2-chlorobenzaldehyde (1.86 g, 13.25 mmol) as a solution in 3 mL of dichloromethane. The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The solid material was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. Toluene (5 mL) was added, the mixture was filtered again and concentrated, giving (E)-ethyl 2-((2-chlorobenzylidene)amino)acetate (2.76 g, 12.23 mmol, 92% yield) which was used directly in the next step.
