Moreover, other than in the examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing, for example, quantities of ingredients used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties to be obtained. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. [012] Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard variation found in their respective testing measurements.

In certain embodiments of a divinyl ether of Formula (12), R2 is a C2-6 n-alkanediyl group, a C3-6 branched alkanediyl group, a Ce-8 cycloalkanediyl group, a Ce-io alkanecycloalkanediyl group, and in certain embodiments, -[(-Ο¾-)8-0-]¾-(-Ο¾-)Γ-. [098] Suitable divinyl ethers include, for example, compounds having at least one oxyalkanediyl group, such as from 1 to 4 oxyalkanediyl groups, i.e., compounds in which m in Formula (12) is an integer ranging from 1 to 4. In certain embodiments, m in Formula (12) is an integer ranging from 2 to 4. It is also possible to employ commercially available divinyl ether mixtures that are characterized by a non-integral average value for the number of oxyalkanediyl units per molecule. Thus, m in Formula (12) can also take on rational number values ranging from 0 to 10.0, such as from 1.0 to 10.0, from 1.0 to 4.0, or from 2.0 to 4.0.

Mixtures of polyfunctionalizing agents may also be used. As a result, bis(sulfonyl)alkanol-containing polythioethers provided by the present disclosure may have a wide range of average functionality. For example, trifunctionalizing agents may afford average functionalities from 2.05 to 3.0, such as from 2.1 to 2.6.

The mercaptan content and molecular weight of the polysulfide can affect the cure speed of the polymer, with cure speed increasing with molecular weight. [0157] Sulfur-containing polyformal prepolymers useful in aerospace sealant applications are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Application Publication No. 2012/0234205 and in U.S. Application Publication No. 2012/0238707.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials, and methods, may be practiced without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Example 1 Synthesis of Thiol-Terminated Polythioether Adduct [0186] A thiol-terminated polythioether was prepared according to Example 1 of U.S. Patent No. 6,172,179. In a 2-L flask, 524.8 g (3.32 mol) of diethylene glycol divinyl ether (DEG-DVE) and 706.7 g (3.87 mol) of dimercaptodioxaoctane (DMDO) were mixed with 19.7 g (0.08 mol) of triallylcyanurate (TAC) and heated to 77 °C. To the reaction mixture was added 4.6 g (0.024 mol) of an azobisnitrile free radical catalyst (Vazo®-67, 2,2'- azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile)). The reaction proceeded substantially to completion after 2 hours to afford 1,250 g (0.39 mol, yield 100%) of a liquid thiol-terminated polythioether adduct having a Tg of -68 °C. and a viscosity of 65 poise. The adduct was faintly yellow and had low odor. Example 2 Synthesis of H^MDI-Terminated Polythioether-Isocyanate Prepolymer [0187] A 1 -liter, 4-neck round-bottomed flask was fitted with a mantle, thermocouple, temperature controller, nitrogen line, mechanical stirrer and dropping funnel. The flask was charged with a thiol-terminated polythioether (652.30 g) prepared according to Example 1. The flask was heated to 71 °C under nitrogen and stirred at 300 rpm. A mixture of 4-hydroxybutyl vinyl ether (47.40 g) and Vazo-67 (1.19 g) was added to the flask in 1 hour via a dropping funnel. The reaction mixture was maintained at 71 °C for 41 hours, at which time the reaction was complete. After this, the reaction apparatus was then fitted with a vacuum line and the product heated to 94 °C. Heating was continued for 1.3 hours under vacuum. Following vacuum treatment, a pale yellow, viscous polythioether polyol (678.80 g) was obtained. The polythioether polyol had a hydroxyl number of 31.8 and a viscosity of 77 Poise. [0188] The polythioether polyol (300.03 g) was then charged into a 500-mL, 4-neck, round-bottom flask. The flask was equipped with a mantle, thermocouple, temperature controller, an inlet for providing nitrogen positive pressure, and a mechanical stirrer (PTFE paddle and bearing). The polythioether polyol was stirred at ca. 200 rpm and heated to 76.6°C (170°F), followed by the addition of Desmodur®-W (H12MDI) (82.00 g) and a 0.01% solution of dibutyltin dilaurate dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone (3.90 g). The reaction mixture was maintained at 76.6 °C for 7 h and then cooled to room temperature. A 1%> solution of benzyl chloride dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone (3.80 g) was then added to the reaction mixture. The resulting HnMDI-terminated polythioether prepolymer had an isocyanate content of 3.9%. Example 3 Synthesis of Silane-Terminated Polythioether Prepolymer [0189] The isocyanate -terminated urethane -containing prepolymer in Example 2 (20.00 g), 3-aminopropylsilane (3.00 g), and methyldimethoxyvinylsilane (4.50 g) were placed in a 60-g Hauschild cup with lid. The mixture was mixed for 4 min at 2300 rpm with a DAC 600 FVZ Speed Mixer, and was left to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. During this time, the isocyanate functionality of the Example 1 polymer fully reacted with 3- aminopropylsilane, yielding a silane-terminated prepolymer. This was evidenced by the viscosity increase of the mixture. Methyldimethoxyvinylsilane dimethoxy(methyl) (vinyl) silane) did not participate in the reaction. Example 4 Formulation of Silane-Terminated Polythioether Prepolymer [0190] 200 μΕ of water and 200 μΕ of dibutyltin dilaurate were added to the mixture in Example 3 and mixed for 30 seconds at 2300 rpm with a DAC 600 FVZ Speed Mixer. The mixture was poured out on a circular, 6-inch in diameter, polycarbonate lid to make tensile and elongation specimens. The specimens were allowed to cure for 3 days, at which time the material was fully cured. The tensile and elongation values were measured according to ASTM 412C. The tensile strength is 451 psi and the elongation is 288%. Example 5 Synthesis of Silane-Terminated Polythioether Prepolymer [0191] The isocyanate -terminated urethane -containing prepolymer in Example 2 (20.00 g), 3-aminopropylsilane (3.02 g), and methyldimethoxyvinylsilane (4.54 g) were placed in a 60-g Hauschild cup with lid. The mixture was mixed for 4 min at 2300 rpm with a DAC 600 FVZ Speed Mixer, and was left to sit at room temperature for 1 hour. During this time, the isocyanate functionality of the Example 1 polymer fully reacted with 3- aminopropylsilane, yielding a silane-terminated prepolymer. This was evidenced by the viscosity increase of the mixture. Methyldimethoxyvinylsilane dimethoxy(methyl) (vinyl) silane) did not participate in the reaction. Example 6 Formulation of Silane-Terminated Polythioether Prepolymer [0192] 200 μΕ of water and 200 μΕ of dibutyltin dilaurate were added to the mixture in Example 5 and mixed for 30 seconds at 2300 rpm with a DAC 600 FVZ Speed Mixer. The mixture was poured out on a circular, 6-inch in diameter, polycarbonate lid to make tensile and elongation specimens. The specimens were allowed to cure for 3 days, at which time the material was fully cured. The tensile and elongation values were measured according to ASTM 412C. The tensile strength is 400 psi and the elongation is 222%. Example 7 Additional Formulations [0193] Additional formulations were prepared similar to that in Examples 4 and 5 and the tensile strength and elongation of the cured sealants measured. The results are summarized in Table 1 and in Table 2. Table 1. Table 2.
