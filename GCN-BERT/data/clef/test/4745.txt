METHOD AN D APPARATUS FOR USE OF A COMPRESSING PLATE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to compressing plates and more particularly but not by way of limitation to a method and apparatus for the use of compressing plates to assist in osteosynthesis. 2. Description of the Related Art Wire, staple, and plate fixation of bone have been used clinically for decades. In the last 20 years or so, nickel-titanium and shape memory materials have been used in orthopedics for their shape changing and superelastic properties. Shape memory devices feature a martensitic and austenitic form, in which the addition of energy in the form of heat transforms the device from a temporan' martensite state to a final austenite state at a defined temperature. The heat for transformation generally is categorized as being (1) room temperature activated (i.e. superelastic), (2) body temperature activated (i.e. body temperature), and (3) above body temperature activated (i.e. heated). The use of a shape memory plate, capable of transforming from a preliminary sha pe to a compressed final sha pe, presents unique challenges. If the plate is superelastic, then the plate is inclined to immediately transform at room temperature, making implantation and the use of screws difficult for a surgeon. If the plate is body temperature or heated, then the surgeon has to rely on either body heat, which is reduced during surgery due to the open wound, or an external heating source to transform the plate. For various reasons, many surgeons would prefer a superelastic shape memory plate. Accordingly, an apparatus and a method of surgical use for a shape memory plate that restrains the plate in an open position while screws are attached and then releases the plate to compress the bones and assist with osteosynthesis would provide an improvement in compressing plate surgeries. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a fixation system includes a plate adapted for affixing between a first bone and a second bone and an insertion tool. The plate defines a central opening and is configurable between an open shape and a compressed shape. Once the plate has been moved to its open shape, the insertion tool inserts into the central opening and abuts the plate to retain the plate in its open shape. The insertion tool allows locating of the plate at the first bone and the second bone. After the plate has been affixed to the first and second bones, the insertion tool releases the plate allowing the plate to move from its open shape to its compressed shape, thereby compressing the first bone with the second bone. The plate includes a first end portion defining a first screw hole and a second end portion defining a second screw hole. The plate further includes first and second arms disposed between the first and second end portions, such that the first and second end portions and the first and second arms define the central opening. The first and second arms expand to configure the plate in its open shape and contract to configure the plate in its compressed shape. The insertion tool includes a retention spacer that inserts into the central opening of the plate when the plate is in its open shape such that the retention spacer abuts the first and second end portions of the plate to retain the plate in its open shape. The insertion tool further includes a platform having a first guide hole that aligns with the first screw hole and a second guide hole that aligns with the second screw hole when the plate is in its open shape. The fixation system includes a first guide tube that inserts through the first guide hole of the platform and engages the first screw hole of the plate and a second guide tube that inserts through the second guide hole and engages the second screw hole of the plate. The fixation system also includes locating pins that insert through the first and second guide tubes for the purpose of creating pilot holes in the first and second bones. The locating pins further retain the plate at the first and second bones. The locating pins include marks that represent the depth of the locating pins within the first and second bones. The plate pre-loaded on the insertion tool may be delivered in a sterile package. Likewise, the first and second guide tubes coupled with the plate may be delivered in the sterile package along with the plate pre-loaded on the insertion tool . A first bone is affixed with a second bone as follows. A plate in its open shape couples with an insertion tool. A first drill guide tube engages a first screw hole of the plate, and a second drill guide tube engages a second screw hole of the plate. The insertion tool locates the plate onto first and second bones. A first locating pin inserts through the first drill guide tube and drills into the first bone, A second locating pin inserts through the second drill guide tube and drills into the second bone. The first locating pin removes from the first drill guide tube, and the first drill guide tube disengages from the plate. A first screw inserts through the first screw hole of the plate and into the first bone. The second locating pin removes from the second drill guide tube, and the second drill guide tube disengages from the plate. A second screw inserts through the second screw hole of the plate and into the second bone. The insertion tool decouples from the plate such that the plate moves to its compressed shape. Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the following. Also, it should be understood that the scope of this mvention is intended to be broad, and any combination of any subset of the features, elements, or steps described herein is part of the intended scope of the mvention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As required, a detailed embodiment of the present invention is disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. It is further to be understood that the figures are not necessarily to scale, and some features may be exaggerated to show details of particular components or steps. Figure 1 illustrates an orthopedic plate 10. The plate can be fabricated from a shape memory materia! such as nitinol (nickel-titanium), or any other elastic material capable of deforming and rebounding to an original shape. The plate 10 is shown in a constrained and stretched open shape 100. In the preferred embodiment, the plate 10 includes a body portion 16 defining a screw hole 1 1 and a body portion 17 defining a screw hole 12. Nevertheless, one of ordinary skill in the art. will recognize that the plate 10 may include more or less body portions and screw holes depending upon the type of surgery. The screw holes 1 1 and 12, or any number of screw holes, can be smooth, tapered, or threaded as necessary to engage a screw. In the preferred embodiment, the screw holes 1 1 and 12 are shown with threads. The plate 10 also includes moveable arms 13 and 14 formed integrally with and between the body portions 16 and 17. Nevertheless, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the plate 10 may include more moveable arms depending upon the type of surgery. The moveable amis 13 and 14 and the end portions 16 and 17 define therebetween a central opening 15, which has been elongated when the plate 10 resides in its open shape 100. The central opening 15 may be any shape, as long as it allows two or more moveable arms 13 and 14 space to move between open and compressed positions. Figure 2 illustrates the same plate 10, except in a compressed shape 101 , which is the original fabrication shape of the plate 10. In this shape, the screw holes 1 1 and 12 can remain circular or change shape if it is desired that they bind upon screws. By application of some energy source, from room temperature, body temperature, or external, the moveable arms 13 and 14 have changed shape from the open shape 100 to the compressed shape 101. In the compressed shape 101 , the moveable arms 13 and 14 have contracted and along with the end portions 16 and 17 define a central opening 15 of a different contracted shape than the elongated shape of the open shape 100. The plate 10 begins in the compressed shape 101 and through application of an external force, the plate is moved from its compressed shape 101 to its open shape 100. In particular, the application of an external force causes the moveable arms 13 and 14 to stretch and expand, elongating the plate 10 and thus the central area 15 into the open shape 100. After application of some energy source, from room temperature, body temperature, or external, the moveable arms 13 and 14 contract and shrink, contracting the plate 10 and thus the central area 15 into the compressed shape 101. Figures 3 and illustrate a drill guide tube 20. The drill guide tube 20 can be made from metal or plate, and has an inner cannulation of diameter 21 and an outer surface 22. A shoulder 23 is a location where a large outer surface 22 reduces to a new small outer surface 24 of smaller diameter. The screw threads 25 extend from the small outer surface 24, and are of the same thread characteristics needed to mate with the screw holes 11 and 12 of the plate 10. Figure 5 illustrates a locating pin 30. The locating pin 30 can be manufactured of any material; in the preferred embodiment, it is made from medical grade metal. The locating pin 30 has cutting flutes 31 for cutting through bone. A shank 32 of the locating pin 30 is of a diameter that will fit into the inner cannulation 21 of the drill guide tube 20. A short sizing line 33 is an ink or engraved mark on the surface of the locating pin 30 to define a certain depth for drilling of a pilot hole. Similarly, a long sizing line 34 is also a mark for defining depth of a pilot hole, only it encircles the circumference of the locating pin 30. Figure 6 illustrates a screw 40 designed to attach the plate 10 to a bone. In the preferred embodiment, the screw 40 has two threaded sections, shank threads 41 and head threads 42. The shank threads 41 are designed to engage bone once inserted into a pilot hole created by the locating pin 30. There is any number of thread characteristics related to pitch, diameter, and threads per inch that will accomplish this purpose. The head threads 42 are designed to engage the screw holes 11 and 12 of the plate 10. Figures 7-9 il lustrate an insertion tool 50. The insertion tool 50 consists of a handle 51, a shaft 52, a platform 53, and a retention spacer 56. The handle 51 can be any shape such that it economically fits a surgeon's hand. The shaft 52 can be any length or angle as required to position the platform 50 on a desired bone surface. In some applications, the shaft 52 might not be needed at all, and could thus be eliminated from the insertion tool 50. The platform 53 is a solid material such as metal or plastic, designed to space drill guide holes 54 and 55 to the proper separation distance, as well as retain the plate 10 in the open shape 100. Thus, the drill guide holes 54 and 55 of the platform 53 correspond to the separation distance of the screw holes 1 1 and 12 of the plate 10 when it is in the open shape 100. The retention spacer 56 is designed to substantially match the length of the central opening 15 of the plate 10 when the plate 10 resides in its open shape 100, and is made from a solid material such as plastic or metal. In this preferred embodiment, the retention spacer 56 is rectangular shape. The shape of the retention spacer 56 is not critical, as long as the retention spacer 56 fits within the central opening 15 when the plate 10 resides in its open shape 100 and includes raised side portions 18 and 19 that abut the end portions 16 and 17 such that the retention spacer 56 holds the plate 10 in the open shape 100. Figures 10-11 illustrate an assembly showing the plate 10, the two drill guide tubes 20, and the plate insertion tool 50. The plate 10 is in the open shape 100 in this configuration. The small outer surface 24 of the drill guide tubes 20 pass through the drill guide holes 54 and 55 that are located on the platform 53 of the insertion tool 50. The screw threads 25 on the drill guide tubes 20 are screwed into the holes 11 and 12 of the plate 10. The retention spacer 56 is positioned in the central opening 15 of the plate 10 such that the ends of the retention spacer 56 abut the end portions 16 and 17 resulting in the retention spacer 56 maintaining the plate 10 in its open shape 100. The screw threads 25 on the drill guide tubes 20 are screwed into the holes 1 1 and 12 of the plate 10. Figures 12-17 illustrate a method of use for a shape memory plate to fixate two bones or bone fragments in a surgery. The surgical procedure begins with the surgeon trying to fixate a first bone 71 and a second bone 72. As illustrated in Figure 12, the plate 10 in the open shape 100 as a result of the insertion of the retention spacer 56 into the central opening 15 is positioned on top of a bone fusion interface 73, which lies between a first bone 71 and a second bone 72, The screw holes I I and 12 of the plate 10 are positioned so that the screw hole 1 1 is over the first bone 71 and screw hole 12 is over the second bone 72. In the preferred method, the plate 10 positioned in its open shape 100 is centered over the fusion interface 73 between the first bone 71 and the second bone 72. The drill guide tubes 20 are screwed into the plate 10, passing through the platform 53 of the insertion tool 50. After positioning the assembly as shown in Figure 12, the surgeon uses two locating pins to temporarily anchor the plate 10 in place and measure screw lengths. As illustrated in Figure 13, the two locating pins 30 which have been drilled into place pass through the drill guide tubes 20, through the platform 53 of the insertion tool 50, through respective screw holes 1 1 and 12 of the plate 10, and then into respective first and second bones 71 and 72. The short and the long sizing lines 33 and 34, respectively, can now be used to assess the depth of a screw 40 to anchor the plate 10. At this time, the surgeon would be ready to screw the plate 10 to the first and second bones 71 and 72. As illustrated in Figure 14, the plate 10 is positioned in its open shape 100 over the first and second bones 71 and 72 as well as centered over the fusion interface 73. One of the drill guide tube 20 remains attached to the plate 10, while the other drill guide tube 20 has been removed from the plate 10 and the platform 53 of the insertion tool 50. At this point, the insertion tool 50 remains attached to the plate 10 with the retention spacer 56 residing within the central opening 15 of plate 10. The screw 40 is screwed into the screw hole 11 of the plate 10. To reach the screw hole 11, the screw 40 passes through the screw hole 54 of the insertion tool 50, The head threads 42 of the screw 40 mate with the screw hole 11 of the plate 10. Once the screw 40 is fully in place, one side of the plate 10 will be anchored to the first bone 71. Referring to Figure 15, once the first screw 40 has been screwed into place in the first bone 71 , the remaining drill tube 20 is removed from the plate 10 and the platform 53 of the insertion tool 50, and a second screw 40 is screwed into the screw hole 12 of the plate 10. The second screw 40 passes through the screw hole 55 of the insertion tool 50. After both the first and second screws 40 have been screwed into place, the insertion tool 50 remains positioned relative to the plate 10 such that the retention spacer 56 is in the central opening 15 of plate 10 as illustrated in Figure 16. The plate 10 thus is screwed to the first bone 71 and the second bone 72 and centered over the bone fusion interface 73. Figure 17 illustrates the final step in the implantation of the pl ate 10 in the first bone 71 and the second bone 72. The insertion tool 50 is removed from the plate 10 due to the extraction, rotation, pulling, and/or or jiggling of the retention spacer 56 from the central opening 15 of the plate 10, The first and second screws 40 are positioned, respectively, in the screw holes 11 and 12 of the plate 10, and thus anchor the plate 10 to the first bone 71 and the second bone 72. With the retention spacer 56 removed, the shape memory plate 10 can now respond to room temperature, body temperature, or external energy input and transform in shape from its open shape 100 to its compressed shape 101. In particular, the moveable arms 13 and 14 decrease in length resulting the first central opening 15 transitioning in shape to the second new central opening 18. While the moveable arms 13 and 14 transform the plate 10 in this preferred embodiment, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that there are any number of designs, orientations, shapes, and numbers of moveable arms that would create the same transformation effect. Upon the transitioning of the plate 10 to its compressed shape 101 , compression is created between the first bone 71 and the second bone 72 at the bone fusion location 73. Summarizing the implantation, the surgeon selects a shape memory plate implant preloaded onto an insertion tool. The plate can also be pre-loaded with drill guide tubes, or those can be attached during surgery. The surgeon positions the plate at the juncture of two bones to be fused or fixated, and uses locating pins to temporarily hold the plate to the bones. The surgeon then removes one locating pin and drill guide tube, replaces it with a screw to hold one side of the plate in place, and then removes the second locating pin and drill guide tube to allow the second screw to be placed. The ingenuity of this system is as follows. A shape memory plate that creates compression has to be held open until both sides of the plate are anchored in bone, lest the compressive force be released too early. This can be accomplished initially with an insertion tool that props open the plate. However, the plate has to be anchored to the bone before the insertion tool can be removed, to preserve the compressive force until the surgeon is ready. This then requires that the screws pass through the insertion tool in some way. The aforementioned method for implantation accomplishes these objectives. Furthermore, this method allows the surgeon to select the timing of the application of compressive force. A surgeon could potentially implant more than one plate, and leave the insertion tools in place, only to release them at the appropriate time. This sequence could allow more complex surgeries to take place. Furthermore, since the presence of the insertion tool can hide or obscure the visibility of th e plate from the surgeon, the two locating pins insure that the plate remains properly oriented on the bones. To use this shape memory plate, a medical device company or hospital could pre-load certain elements of the system prior to surgery. The shape memory plate 10 must be stretched from its compressed shape 101 shown in Figure 2, to its open shape 100 shown in Figure I . The plate must then be held open via an insertion tool, such as insertion tool 50, which restrains the plate 10 in an open shape 100, This then allows for a method of preparation of the plate. Plate 10 is stretched from compressed shape 101 to open shape 100. Plate 10 is placed on insertion tool 50. Drill guides 20 can optionally be attached prior to surgery or at the time of surgery. It is also contemplated that the pre-loaded plate could be delivered in a sterile package.
