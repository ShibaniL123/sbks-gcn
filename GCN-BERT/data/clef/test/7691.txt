The present invention relates to a composition for preventing, improving, or treating Th1-mediated immune diseases or Th2-mediated immune diseases comprising one or more extracts as active ingredients selected from the group consisting of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract and Arisaema amurense extract; and a method for preventing, improving, or treating Th1-mediated immune diseases or Th2-mediated immune diseases. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART In recent years, allergies have increased due to various reason including changing dietary habits, better hygiene and intensified pollution along with advancement in income levels, and about 20-25% of the entire population have symptoms of, for example, atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma and rhinitis. These significantly affect the quality of life, and may lead to serious social issues. Also, it cannot be ignored that food allergies are found in 6-8% of infants and also cause 35% of children's ADs. Until now, a medicine that shows definite effects against various allergies has not existed and, thus, treating children who have these allergies has been especially difficult even though children's ADs have been on the rise. Particularly, drugs that have similar characteristics as steroids bring about serious side effects so there are currently attempts around the world to prepare for alternative solutions. To combat these allergies, materials that are expected to have positive results without any toxicity or side effects must be extracted from natural substances and foods, which then should be actively utilized. Moreover, the anti-allergy mechanism of action for active materials and their components must be also examined in detail. The main-stream medicine popular in the 21st century have been those for allergies and diabetes (Japan's Nikkei Sankyo Newspapers). In the United States, around 50 million people possess many different kinds of allergies (drug and medicine market, $5.2 billion annually). In Japan, there exists a market for functional foods worth around 60 billion JPY while that of drugs and medicine related to allergies is worth 156 billion JPY annually, compared to the Korean market for drugs and medicine, which is worth around 50 billion KRW. Looking at the recent trend of patents in functional foods, most of the ones submitted are in the area of "anti-obesity", followed by "anti-allergy", an area that is anticipated to be of much added value but also requires necessary preparation. There has been an increasing need for development of health functional foods, emphasizing immune function controls or activation of allergy suppression, which has resulted in numerous patents submitted to the Korea Food and Drug Administration. Also, according to patent analyses in Japan during recent years, the future potential for functional foods was reported to lie in the activation of "anti-obesity" and then "anti-allergy". The term "allergy" has been originated from a Greek word "allos", which means "hypersensitive reaction", and refers to the "deformed". In other words, an allergy is an occurrence caused by a substance, which has no effect on average people, inducing abnormally hypersensitive reaction such as hives, itching, nasal discharges and/or coughs on a particular individual due to malfunctioning of the immune system. In the last 20 years, the incidence rate of allergic diseases has been trending upward globally (1, 2). Primary reasons for this increase include more time spent indoors, development of new materials, sudden influx of allergy-inducing materials particularly from overseas, unstable immune statuses due to environmental contamination and stress, and changing dietary habits. Although the incidence rate of allergic diseases in the people of modern era has steadily increased, many only rely on well-known treatments such as anti-histamines or steroids without finding a fundamental treat for it (3). Gell and Coombes (1963) traditionally divide allergic reactions into 4 categories based on time and types of expression (4). Types I through III are humoral immunologic responses (immediate-type) in which antibodies are involved while Type IV is a cellular immunologic response (delayed-type). Also, based on the types of cells and medium concerned with immune reactions, responses are divided into immediate or early responses in which symptoms are displayed within minutes, and late-stage responses in which symptoms appear after a few hours. For example, Type I takes the form of an immediate hypersensitive reaction while Type IV is a delayed hypersensitive reaction. Most allergic reactions are categorized as Type I, which includes diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, food and drug allergies and atopic dermatitis, and severe cases lead to anaphylaxis, which may risk one's life. Type I immediate hypersensitive reactions are further divided into 2 steps. In the first step, allergen penetrates into a body and suppresses secretion of IgE and IgG1. Once the balance between Th1 cellular response, which produces IL-12 and IFN-r that increase secretion of IgG2a, and Th2 cellular response, which produces IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, tips in the direction of Th2, IL-4, IL-13 and others are discharged due to an excessive hypersensitive reaction of Th2. Because of this effect, IgE specific antibodies produced by B cells are attached to mast cells or basophils, and, subsequently, an allergic crisis is ready, all of which is called the sensitization of allergens (5-7) (Refer to figure: "Allergic Diseases", "Th1/Th2 Balance"). The second step of allergic crisis is divided into early and late responses. In the early response, an allergen re-penetrates the body, stimulates mast cells and induces degranulative reactions, releasing histamines, lipid metabolites and Cytokine at this time to cause blood vessels to expand. In the late response, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophage, Th2 cells and basophils infiltrate into a particular tissue and are activated, which leads to inflammation and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, rhinitis and asthma (7). Among these secreted matters of degranulation, histamine is the most well-known and used as an essential indicator for allergic symptoms due to its relations to immediate hypersensitive reactions (8). On the other hand, food allergies have occurred in about 3 to 6% of children in developed countries for the past 10 years and show an upward trend (9). Food allergies, which are caused by food coming into a body through the digestive tract, belong primarily to Type I hypersensitive reaction. For allergy patients, food allergens penetrate through intestinal canals at an undigested state (4, 10) and, thus, the absorption of allergens inside intestines is the first step of an allergic crisis (11). Intestinal canals not only take care of digestion and absorption of nutrients but also are involved in various biomodulation. Primary characteristics of intestinal epithelial cells include digestion and absorption, the role as a barrier and transfer and conversion of food signals. As they also possess developed a special immune system (mucosal immunity) and nerve tissues, the role of digestive and intestinal canals must not be underestimated. Thus, as a barrier, intestinal epithelial cells restrict the penetration of large molecules by a tight junction; however, if the tight junction is damaged, the permeability increases due to the dysfunction of the barrier, which may result in diseases such as food allergies, celiac disease and acute pancreatitis (12-17). In other words, food allergies can be prevented by strengthening the barrier function of intestinal canals through stabilization of tight junction. The research papers previously mentioned have reported, to a great extent, about the activation of the allergy inhibition in foods and natural products, which have been popularly used especially by Koreans in oriental medicine and home remedies to treat and prevent allergies (18, 19). These research mostly evaluate the inhibitory activity of degranulation in medicinal herbs such as areca nuts, Anemarrhena rhizome and fenugreek (20-33) and also report on Th1/Th2 immune response controls in polysaccharide components such as quercetin, Siberian gooseberries, garlic, perilla oil, konjac, lobulus and liriope rhizome in addition to those in Lingzhi mushrooms and Japanese soy sauce as well as royal jelly and cordyceps (34-44). Also reported were results on the activation which suppresses allergic inflammation in lactobacillus, fermented barley and cheonggukjang, a Korean fermented soybean soup (45-49). Throughout the entire specification, many papers and patent documents are referenced and their citations are represented. The disclosures of cited papers and patent documents are entirely incorporated by reference into the present specification, and the level of the technical field within which the present invention falls and details of the present invention are explained more clearly.

The composition of this invention may be used to prevent or treat various Th1-mediated immunity diseases, disorders and symptoms. The term used herein "Th1-mediated immunity diseases" refers to the diseases involved with Cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-γ or TNF-α, which are created by the formation and/or activation of Th1 cells. IL-17 is produced by Th17 cells (CD4+T cells) and TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ etc. are involved in IL-17 production. Because IL-17 production is induced by the cytokines, IL-17 is involved in Th1-mediated immunity diseases. The term used herein "Th1 cells" represents the subset of helper T cell lymphocytes specified for the purposes of gene expression, protein secretion and functional activation. For example, Th1 cells manifest a cytokine expression pattern, which synthesizes IL-2 and IFN-γ but does not synthesize IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Also, the Th1 cells are involved in cell-mediated immune responses on various pathogens within cells, organ-specific autoimmune diseases as well as delayed hypersensitive reactions. There are no specific restrictions on the Th1-mediated immunity diseases. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the Th1-mediated immunity disease, to which the compositions of the invention are applied, is transplant rejection, autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. According to other embodiment of the present invention, Th1-mediated immunity disease, to which the compositions of the invention are applied, is colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. Th1-mediated immunity diseases, to which the compositions of the invention are applied, include colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, myocarditis, endocarditis, pericarditis, cystic fibrosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, leprosy, syphilis, Lyme disease, borreliosis, neurogenic borreliosis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, lupus, discoid lupus, chilblain lupus, lupus nephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, asthma, macular degeneration, uveitis, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, Sjogren's syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic fatigue & immunological incompetence syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, but are not limited thereto. According to other embodiment of the present invention, the Th1-mediated immunity disease, to which the compositions of the invention are applied, is colitis, inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis. The composition of this invention may be used to prevent or treat various Th2-mediated immunity diseases, disorders or symptoms. The term used herein "Th2-mediated immunity diseases" refer to the diseases involved with IgE and mast cells based on production and activity of allergen-specific Th2 cells. The term used herein "Th2 cells" represents the subset of helper T cell lymphocytes specified for the purposes of gene expression, protein secretion and functional activation. Th2 cells manifest a pattern of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 Cytokines, and are involved in humoral immunity reactions. There are no specific restrictions on the Th2-mediated immunity diseases and, according to an embodiment of the present invention, this type of Th2-induced immunity diseases is allergic diseases. The term used herein "allergy" means various diseases and symptoms induced by a human immune system's hypersensitive reactions against a certain matter coming from outside. Allergic diseases that apply to the compositions of this invention are, preferably, Type I immediate hypersensitive reactions and Type IV delayed hypersensitive reactions. Type I immediate hypersensitive reactions include bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic otitis media, hives and anaphylactic shocks, whereas some of the Type IV delayed hypersensitive reactions are contact hypersensitivity, allergic contact dermatitis, bacteria allergies, fungus allergies, virus allergies, and drug allergies, thyroiditis and allergic encephalitis. Type I immediate hypersensitive reactions are divided into 2 steps. In the first step, allergen penetrates into a body and inhibits secretion of IgE and IgG1. Once the balance between Th1 cellular response, which produces IL-12 and IFN-γ that increase secretion of IgG2a, and Th2 cellular response, which produces IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, tips in the direction of Th2, IL-4, IL-13 and others are discharged due to an excessive hypersensitive reaction of Th2. Because of this effect, IgE specific antibodies produced by B cells are attached to mast cells or basophils, and, subsequently, an allergic crisis is ready, all of which is called the sensitization of allergens. The second step of allergic crisis is divided into early and late responses. In the early response, an allergen re-penetrates the body, stimulates mast cells and induces degranulative reactions, releasing histamines, lipid metabolites and Cytokine at this time to cause blood vessels to expand. In the late response, neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophage, Th2 cells and basophils infiltrate into a particular tissue and are activated, which leads to inflammation and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, rhinitis and asthma. Among these secreted matters of degranulation, histamine is the most well-known and used as an essential indicator for allergic symptoms due to its relations to immediate hypersensitive reactions. The allergic diseases to which the invented compositions are applied include atopic dermatitis, other dermal diseases related to atopic syndrome, allergic rhinitis (acute or chronic), hay fever, asthma and food allergies, but not limited thereto. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the allergic diseases to which this invention is applied include asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic dermatitis, allergic atopic dermatitis or food allergies. According to a specific embodiment of the present invention, the allergic diseases are food allergies. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the compositions of the invention inhibit degranulation of mast cells. The term used herein "degranulation" refers to a process in which antibacterial cytotoxic molecules are separated from granules and secretory vesicles existing inside a specific cell, which includes granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and mast cells inside the immune system as well as specific lymph cells such as natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells.

Examples Example 1: Preparing Samples and Solvent Extracts Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract and Arisaema amurense extract were purchased from Korea Plant Extract Bank and used as samples, each of which was extracted with 95% ethanol or water. That is, a 200 g sample powder was added to 1.8 L of 95% EtOH, and the first extraction was performed via reflux extraction for 3 hours. Then extracts were performed vaccum filtration, and samples that had remained after filtration were added to 2 L of 95% ethanol followed by the second extraction, obtaining 95% ethanol extracts of the samples. The 95% ethanol extraction temperature of the samples is 84-86°C. The results of the first extract and the second extract was combined, and enriched followed by freeze drying. Example 2: Test for inhibitory activity for penetration of OVA using Caco-2 single cell layer Caco-2 cell culture and test for inhibitory activity for penetration of OVA Caco-2 cell strains (HTB-37) originated from ATCC underwent subculture in a DMEM (Dulbeco's Modified Eagle's Medium) medium, which contains 10% FBS, 1% 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/mll streptomycin and 0.1 mM non-essential amino acid under the conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2. In order to conduct a passing test of food allergens using a Caco-2 single cell layer, 0.5 ml of Caco-2 cells were deposited on the transmembrane, which forms the apical side of 12 transwell plates, at the concentration of 2×105 cells/ml by using the above culture medium. On the basolateral side of a well, 1.5 ml of the culture medium was added and cultivated in a thermo-hygrostat under the conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2. The medium was changed once every 2-3 days. In 2-3 weeks after the deposition, Caco-2 cells came to form a single cell layer. Here, the Transepitherial Electrical Resistance (TEER, Ω×cm2) between basolateral and apical sides of the Caco-2 cells were measured using the Millicell-ERS (Electrical Resistance System, Millipore, U.S.A.), and cells whose values are greater than 300 Ω× cm2 were used in experiments. The Caco-2 single cell layer was then washed with HBSS (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution) for 3 times, and Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract or Arisaema amurense extract (final concentration: 400 µg/ml) was added to the apical side, along with bile salts (final concentration: 100-150 µg/ml). The mixture was then processed for 1 hour in a thermo-hygrostat under the conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2. Next, OVA (Ovalbumin) was added to the apical side (final concentration: 400 µg/ml), and the mixture was placed in the identical thermo hygrostat with same conditions to react for 3 hours, after which the TEER value was measured one more time. The experimental group which was treated with both of Arisaema amurense extract and OVA showed that TEER levels were higher than the positive control which was treated with only OVA. This result represents that the Arisaema amurense extract inhibits the penetration of allergens through the intestinal epithelial cell layer by increasing TEER levels of Caco-2 single cell layer (fig. 1c). Here, succus on the basolateral side was gathered and the concentration of passed OVA was measured using sELISA (sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). The amount of passed OVA contained within the basolateral side can be calculated as follows. Flux=C ng/H hr/Scm2 In the above equation, C represents the amount of passed OVA calculated by using ELISA, H the reaction time after adding OVA in the apical side of the Caco-2 single cell layer (3h), and S the apical side's surface area on a transwell plate (1.12 cm2). On investigation of the OVA penetration amount, the experimental group which was treated with both of Arisaema amurense extract and OVA showed that the OVA penetration amounts were reduced, compared to the positive control which is treated with only OVA. On converting the result into a percentage, the effects of the OVA penetration inhibition were 40-60% by the Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract and 10-20% by the Arisaema amurense extract (fig. 1b and 1c). OVA analysis by ELISA Anti-rabbit-OVA antibodies diluted to the concentration of 2 µg/ml was combined with a coating buffer solution ((tris hydroxymethyl) aminomethane 0.05 M, pH 9.0), and 100 µl of the mixture was deposited onto 96 well plates and kept overnight at 4°C. The coated 96 well plates were washed 3 times with a washing buffer solution (PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) containing Tween 20; PBST, 0.138 M NaCl, 0.0027 M KCl and 0.01 M phosphate buffer solution containing 0.05% Tween 20). Then, 100 µl of standard OVA, which had been diluted by a specific multiple, and the recovered solution were added to HBSS for each well, and were left to react at room temperature for 1 hour. The well plates were washed again with the washing buffer solution, and biotin, which had been bound with anti-OVA antibodies, was diluted to a certain concentration by PBST. Then, 100 µl for each well were processed and left to react at room temperature for 1 hour. Repeating the above process with a different solution this time, the plates were washed with the washing buffer solution, avidin-HRP was diluted to a certain concentration by PBST and 100 µl of the mixture were processed for each well and left to react at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, another washing operation took place by the washing buffer solution. Next, for a substrate solution, phenyl propionic acid/phosphate buffer (36 mM, pH 7.0) added with 0.002% H2O□ was used while, for a response stop solution, 100 µl of 1 M NaOH-glycine (1 M glycine/1 M NaOH) was used for each well. A fluorescent microplate reader was used to measure the fluorescence at 320/405 nm (Ex./Em. wavelength). Example 3: Testing of Th1/Th2 Cytokine Balance Control Activated by Extracts (ex vivo) Mouse spleen cell culture immunized with OVA Allergens were administered to 5-week-old female BALB/c mice twice in the span of a week through intraperitoneal immunization in order to induce allergies. The allergens, a solution of OVA (20 µg) and alum (2 mg) mixed for 30 minutes, were intraperitoneally injected for 100 µl on each mouse (n=5). After a week of immunization, the cervical vertebrae of the mice were dislocated, their spleens were extracted under sterile conditions, transferred to a small petri dish containing the basal medium of 1 ml (RPMI1640 containing 2-mercaptoethanol and antibiotics, WelGene, Daegu, Korea), and subsequently kept on top of an ice box. The spleens contained in a petri dish, were monocellularized by using a mesh and washed twice with 5 ml of basal medium before performing a centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. After removing the supernatant, 1 ml of RBC (Red Blood Cell) buffer solution (Sigma R7757, U.S.A.) was added, shaken sufficiently by hand and suspended. It was then left on ice for 3 minutes and another 10 ml of basal medium was added and suspended before performing 2 times of centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. Antigens (OVA, 100 µg/ml) were processed on a 96-well plate and specific concentrations for each of the aforementioned natural products were added. Then, the spleen cells were separately deposited on the well at 5x106 cells. The supernatant was collected after 72 hours of incubation in a thermal hygrostat with 37°C, CO2. Analyzing cytokine of spleen cell culture supernatant The spleen cell culture supernatants which were treated with the antigen (OVA, 100 µg/ml) and extract were collected in 72 hours and used in cytokine analysis. The analysis was performed by using an BD OptEIATM MOUSE ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Briefly, captured antibodies were added onto 96 well plates, which were placed overnight at 4°C. The 96 well plates coated with the captured antibodies were then washed with a washing buffer solution (PBST), and 200 µl of diluent for analysis (PBS containing 10% FBS) was added to each well before undergoing blocking for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, 100 µl of each standard specimen and sample was deposited onto each well and left to react for 2 hours at room temperature, and 100 µl of each detection antibody and streptavidin-HRP was deposited onto each well and left to react for 1 hour at room temperature. After reaction, each well was driven to develop a certain color, with the help of 100 µl of substrate solution (citric acid-phosphate buffer containing 0.01% TMB, pH 5.0, 0.001% H202), for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then, 50 µl of 2M H2S04 was added to each well in order to stop the color reaction. The level of color formation was gauged with a microplate reader (THERMOmax, Molecular Devices, U.S.A.) by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm. An investigation of the effects that Poria cocos Wolf bark extract or Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract has on cytokine production of spleen cells showed that the Poria cocos Wolf bark extract reduced the IL-4 production in spleen cells by 65.1% at the concentration of 10 µg/ml and 86.5% at the concentration of 30 µg/ml, compared to the control group, the IL-10 production by 95% (fig. 2a), the IFN-γ production by 95.8% and the IL-17 production by 50.5% and (fig. 2b). Also, the Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract reduced the IL-4 production in spleen cells by 47.2% at the concentration of 10 µl/ml, compared to a control group (Fig. 2c). The reducing effects of IL-4 and/or IL-10 production of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract or Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract shows that the Poria cocos Wolf bark extract or the Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract reduces Th2 immune response. Also, the reducing effects of IL-17 and/or IFN-γ production of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract shows that the Poria cocos Wolf bark extract reduces Th1 immune response, Th17 immune response or Th1/Th17 immune response. Example 4: Test for inhibitory activity of degranulation Collecting mast cells in abdominal cavity After anesthetizing a mouse with ether and killing it by heavily striking the back of its head, about 10 ml of medium (pH 7.4) was injected into its abdominal cavity and the abdominal wall was gently massaged for 90 seconds before being cut at the center line. An abdominal washing solution was collected via pipettes and, after allowing it to undergo centrifugation at 100×g for 10 minutes, the supernatant was removed. The abdominal suspension was made and utilized in experiments in such a way that the number of mast cells becomes 1×106 cells/ml in the identical medium. Observing morphologic alteration of mast cells 25 µl of saline or 25 µl of the Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract or Arisaema amurense extract (each of 1 µg/ml, 0.1 µg/ml and 0.01 µg/ml) was added to 200 µl of mast cell suspension which had been re-suspended, and was left to react for 10 minutes inside a 37°C-incubator. After the reaction was complete, a 25-µl solution of Compound 48/80 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) was added and left to react for 20 minutes. To observe the shape of mast cells through an optical microscope, 200 µl of the mast cell suspension in which the reaction had been completed was dropped on top of a slide glass (slide glass, 22×60 mm) located on the stage of an inverted microscope, allowing the mast cells to be precipitated and placed at room temperature for 10 minutes. By using a hemacytometer with four hundred-fold magnification, the mast cells were observed through an inverted microscope (Olympus, Japan). Being mostly round-shaped or egg-shaped, mast cells have a defined cell outline and are filled with a lot of granules inside their cytoplasm. The diameter of a mast cell is about 10-20 µm, which is twice as large as those of other cells (lymphocytes or neutrophil leukocytes) in an abdominal suspension. Thus, cells that possess these characteristics are categorized as normal mast cells. In contrast, cells that have a vague outline and/or granules within cytoplasm either sticking out of the surface or dispersed around them are regarded as degranulated type. The rate of degranulation was calculated based on the following formula. Rate of degranulation of mast cells%=the number of degranulated mast cells/the total number of mast cellsx100 The effects that Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract or Arisaema amurense extract have on the degranulation rate of mast cells due to Compound 48/80 were examined. Compared to the control group that only processed Compound 48/80, adding 1.0 µg/ml of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract to a test group that had been processed with Compound 48/80 turned out to show effects of degranulation inhibition by 65-85% (fig. 3a). And if 0.01-1.00 µg/ml of Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract is processed, the effect of degranulation inhibition was 40-80% (fig. 3b). Also, if 0.01-1.00 µg/ml of Arisaema amurense extract is processed, the effect of degranulation inhibition was 50-70% (fig. 3c). Example 5: Induction activity into Treg cells Experimental animals 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. They were raised in an animal testing facility located at the College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, and all tests were conducted according to the regulations and guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Seoul National University. Production of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract or Arisaema amurense extract Each of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract or Arisaema amurense extract was provided by Korea Food Research Institute as dissolved in DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) at the concentration of 25-100 mg/ml. In order to create a concentration suitable for the experiment, the above extract was diluted by using a cell culture medium, as known as complete medium (a medium that added FBS 10%, penicillin/ streptomycin 1%, sodium pyruvate 1%, non-essential amino acid 1%, HEPES 2.5% and β- mercaptoethanol 0.1% to Gibco RPMI). The same amount of DMSO, a solvent, and extract were added to a complete medium and the resulting solution was used as the control group. Preparation of cells After putting the mouse to euthanasia with CO2, spleens and lymph nodes were separated and passed through a 70 µm strainer, which led to the acquisition of unicellular, suspended matters. In order to obtain naive CD4 T cells, it was dyed with CD25-PE antibodies (eBioscience) and attached with anti-PE, anti-CD8α, anti-B220 and anti-CD11b bead (Miltenyl Biotec). Then, it underwent depletion using MACS (Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting), resulting in an enrichment of CD4 T cells. Afterwards, CD62L-biotin antibodies (eBioscience) and anti-biotin bead (Miltenyl Biotec) were attached and naive CD4 T cells were gathered through MACS. The unicellular suspended matters obtained from spleens and lymph nodes were dissolved in RBC and attached with CD3-biotin antibodies (eBioscience) and anti-biotin bead (Miltenyl Biotec) before undergoing MACS depletion. The resulting cells were used as antigen-presenting cells. In vitro cell culture All cell culture was performed in a complete medium. In the case of antibody stimulation, 2 µg/ml of anti-CD3 was coated over 96 well flat plates throughout one night, and was added with dissolution of 5×104 cells/well of naive CD4 T cells along with 1 µg/ml of anti-CD28. In the case of stimulating antigen-presenting cells, the dissolved anti-CD3 antibodies were added to the 96 well U-bottom plates, and 6×104 cells/well of antigen-presenting cells were cultivated with 3×104 cells/well of naive CD4 T cells. In both cases, a recombined mouse IL-2 was added with the concentration of 10 ng/ml, and the extract diluted to a desired concentration was then added to each well. These were cultivated under the conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 72 hours before the cells were collected and analyzed. Foxp3 dyeing in cells and flow cytometric analysis The cultivated cells were withdrawn and dyed on the surface for 15 minutes by using a buffer solution, a mixture of PBSN (0.14M NaCl, 0.003M KCl, 0.01M Na2HPO4, 0.002M KHPO4, 0.002M NaN3) and 1% FBS, and CD4-PE/Cy7 (Biolegend). Afterwards, eBioscience's Foxp3 dye set was used to stain Foxp3 in cells, according to specified instructions. For the FACS analysis, BD FACS Calibur and Cell Questpro were used. An investigation of the effects that Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract or Arisaema amurense extract have on Foxp3 expression in cells showed that the Foxp3 expression had more than doubled by 10 µg/ml of the Poria cocos Wolf bark extract or Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract, compared to the control group. If Arisaema amurense extract is processed, the Foxp3 expression showed concentration-dependent increase. These results represent that Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract or Arisaema amurense extract induces differenciation into Treg cells (fig. 4a, 5a and 6a). Cytokine analysis The cytokine production effect in spleen of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, which are revealed as cytokines of supernatant of cultured spleen cell were analyzed like the method of Example 3, were examined. If 10 µg/ml of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract is added, production of TGF-β which is Treg cytokine increased by 70.3%, compared to a control group (the bottom of the fig. 4b). The effect of increased TGF-β production confirm that Poria cocos Wolf bark extract induces differentiation into Treg cells. Statistical analysis Student's t-test is used for significance evaluation of the results. Example 6: Stabilizing activity of Treg cells Many of components act on foxp3 expression in Treg cells. The expression activity of foxp3 gene promoter in itself is weak, so other foxp3 regulatory components have an effect on chromatins and are involved in the expression. For example, in foxp3-CNS1 (Forkhead box P3-Conserved Noncoding Sequence1), there are binding sites against Smad-3 which is activate by NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells) and TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor-beta), it plays an important role in induction of naive CD4 T cells into Treg cells in periphery. The foxp3 expression is not maintained permanently, usually disappeared by many factor such as changes of methylation. According to a published research, when OX40(CD134), which is a member of TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) receptor superfamily, is cross-linked, the foxp3 expression and immunosuppressive activity of Treg cell are disappeared. Therefore, Treg cell stabilizing activity of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract and Arisaema amurense extract was verified by maintenance of foxp3 expression. The foxp3-GFP mice are used in order to verify maintenance of foxp3 expression by Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract and Arisaema amurense extract. Because the foxp3-GFP mice express foxp3 and GFP fluorescence in nucleus, it is possible to identify without nucleus staining process. Because the mice is C57BL/6 line, the effects of foxp3 induction in Balb/c mice were confirmed in C57BL/6 mice, and there are the same effects in C57BL/6 mice. The natural Treg cells generated thymus of Foxp3-GFP mice express fluorescence in itself, so the Treg cells could be separated by FACS and we confirmed that the purity of the cells is near 100%. When the Treg cells were cultured for 3 days, a ratio of foxp3 expressing cells was decreased by 63.43% (ctrl: a control group). This happens because foxp3 expression is regulated by many components, and the foxp3 maintenance conditions are not satisfied as mentioned above. On the other hand, if 10 µg/ml of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, 10 µg/ml of Cynanchym atratum Bunge or 100 µg/ml of Arisaema amurense extract is processed, the ratio of foxp3 expression was maintained high, compared to a control group. In other words, the ratio of foxp3 expression was maintained by 74.91% in case of treatment of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, 75.78% in case of treatment of Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract, and 69.98% in case of treatment of Arisaema amurense extract, and the ratio of foxp3 expression is higher than that of the control group, therefore, we found that Poria cocos Wolf bark extract, Cynanchym atratum Bunge extract or Arisaema amurense extract has stabilizing activity of Treg cells (fig. 4b, 5b and 6b). Example 7: Test for in vivo anti-allergic activity of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract 5-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased and OVA (20 µg) and alum (2 mg) were intraperitoneally injected twice to the mice for immune response after a week of adjustment. 25 mg/kg of 95% EtOH Poria cocos Wolf bark extract was orally administered every day for 10 days on each mouse, and blood was gathered and spleen and mesenteric lymph node were separated after the final oral administration. The serum was separated from the blood, and used for analysis of IgE, IgG2a and IgG1. The spleen and the mesenteric lymph node were monocellularized and were processed with 100 µg/ml of OVA. These were cultivated for 72 hours and cytokines in culture supernatant were analyzed. ELISA kits (BD bioscience) used to analze Cytokines including IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 as Th2-related cytokines, INF-γ as Th1-related cytokines, and TGF-β as Treg cytokines. If 95% EtOH Poria cocos Wolf bark extract decrease IgE, IgG2a and IgG1 by about 37.9%, 38.4% and 49.7%, respectively, compared to a control greoup (fig. 7a), IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 by about 43.1%, 56.8% and 17.3% (fig. 7b), INF-γ by about 38.8% (fig. 7c), and increase TGF-β by about 37% (fig. 7d). Therefore, Poria cocos Wolf bark extract has anti-allergenic activity because the extract decrease IgE, IgG2a and IgG1 of serum in vivo, Th2- and Th1-related cytokines, and increase Treg cytokines. Example 8: Test for activity of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract in food allergy models. Preparation of food allergy models 5-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased and OVA (20 µg) and alum (2 mg) were intraperitoneally injected to the mice after a week of adjustment in order to induce allergies. 25 mg/kg (body weigh) of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract was orally administered every day, and 50 mg of OVA was orally administered together every 3 days in order to induce food allergies. For positive control groups, Dexamethason (2.5 mg/kg (body weight)) were administered like the Poria cocos Wolf bark extract administered group. Fig. 8 represents the specific schedules. Mesurements of diarrhea score, anaphylatic response and change of rectal temperature Diarrhea score, anaphylatic response and change of rectal temperature as a food allergenic indicator were observed every 15 minutes for 60 minutes when the oral administration of the 4th, 5 th and 6 th treatment of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract with OVA. The Poria cocos Wolf bark extract reduced diarrhea score, anaphylatic response and change of rectal temperature, compared to a control group (fig. 9). Therefore, Poria cocos Wolf bark extract reduce induction of food allergy. Analysis of cytokines in cellularized spleen supernatant The spleens of food allergy models were monocellularized and processed with OVA 100 µg/ml. These were cultivated for 72 hours and the culture supernatant was collected and cytokines of which were analyzed. The analysis was performed by using an BD OptEIATM MOUSE ELISA(Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The Poria cocos Wolf bark extract reduced the productions of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 as Th2-related cytokines of spleen cells by about 47.3%, 34.5%, 36.7% and 37.7%, respectively (fig. 10a and 10b), increase TGF-β as Treg cytokine which is related in induction of foxp3 expression in vivo by about 51.6% (fig. 10c). The effects of decrease in production of Th2-related cytokines and increase in production of foxp3 expression induction cytokines by Poria cocos Wolf bark extract represent induction of differentiation into Treg cells. Example 9: Activating fraction discovery of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract Seperation of solvent fraction The freeze dried 95% EtOH extract Of Poria cocos Wolf bark was melted in water and first extracted by hexane which is low-polarity solvent. After filterating, the samples were sequentially separated 3-4 times by using chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol, and separated into five fractions. We named the five fractions Hexane Fr., Chloroform Fr., Ethyl acetate Fr., Butanol Fr. And Water Fr. (fig. 11a). Activating fraction of Poria cocos Wolf bark extract The foxp3 induction activities of the five fractions were measured by the above mentioned methods in Example 5. We found that the hexane fraction had foxp3 induction activities (fig. 11b and 11c).
