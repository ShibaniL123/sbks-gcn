This application is a 371 of PCT/KR2010/003365 filed on May 27, 2010 published on Jan. 6, 2011 under publication number WO 2011/002161 A which claims priority benefits to Korean Patent Application Number 10-2009-0058499 filed Jun. 29, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a transdermal composition comprising tolterodine having improved storage stability. BACKGROUND ART Overactive bladder is a urological condition defined by a set of symptoms such as urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and urge incontinence. Urinary frequency refers to a condition in which people urinate more than 8 times a day. The urge to urinate may remain even after urination. Urinary urgency refers to a sudden strong urge to urinate with little or no chance to postpone the urination. Urge incontinence refers to an involuntary loss of urine associated with urinary urgency. It is estimated that more than 50 million have overactive bladder globally and it occurs in 22% of people aged 40 or older. Although overactive bladder occurs in both sexes of all ages, it is more frequent in women. It is often associated with frequent contraction of detrusor, the smooth muscle of the bladder. That is, because the bladder muscle contracts more frequently than normal or necessary, the patient feels a sudden, compelling urge to urinate although the bladder is not full. The causes are mostly unknown. In some patients, signaling from the brain to the bladder may be problematic. Damage to the nerves caused by surgical operation or childbirth may also be the cause. Some male patients have the overactive bladder disease along with prostatic hyperplasia. Overactive bladder significantly affects quality of life by leading to lack of sleep, decreased work efficiency, avoidance of sex, depression and avoidance of inter-personal relations caused by lack of knowledge about the disease and shame. According to a study about the quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire), overactive bladder has a worse effect on quality of life than chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Accordingly, development of a novel pharmaceutical compound capable of improving the quality of life of individuals is required. U.S. Pat. No. 5,382,600 discloses that (substituted) 3,3-diphenylpropylyamine is useful in treating overactive bladder. Especially, the patent teaches that tolterodine, the N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropylamine compound having the formula 2-[(1R)-3-(diisopropylamino)-1-phenylpropyl)]-4-methylphenol is useful. U.S. Pat. No. 6,517,864 discloses that transdermal administration of tolterodine is effective for treatment of overactive bladder. Particularly, this patent teaches that tolterodine is advantageous for transdermal administration because of high potency and short half-life and a more therapeutic effect on overactive bladder may be attained due to a more constant serum concentration. Tolterodine is currently marketed as an orally administered drug under the trade name Detrol in the form of tartrate salt. Although a free base form of tolterodine is best suited for transdermal administration, it has decreased stability. SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem The inventors of the present invention have made efforts to develop a new drug delivery system capable of ensuring pharmaceutical stability of tolterodine and improving quality of life of patients with improvement of compliance. As a result, they developed a transdermal composition comprising a specific antioxidant as a stabilizer and having superior stability and completed the present invention. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a transdermal composition comprising tolterodine with superior stability. Solution to Problem To accomplish the aforesaid object, the present invention provides a transdermal composition comprising tolterodine, which contains an antioxidant as a stabilizer and can be stored for a long period of time. Advantageous Effects of Invention The composition for transdermal administration according to the present invention, which contains an antioxidant as a stabilizer, can be stored for a long period of time. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Hereinafter, the embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail. In order to understand why tolterodine is unstable, decomposition test was performed under stress conditions of acid, base, oxidation and heat. Much of decomposed substances of tolterodine were produced under a harsh oxidizing condition. Thus, in order to ensure stability under a harsh oxidizing condition, an antioxidant that can ensure the stability of tolterodine and satisfy the processability of preparation into transdermal formulation is used. Preferably, the antioxidant is one or more selected from organic acids and derivatives thereof, amino acids and derivatives, and metal thiolates. The organic acid as the antioxidant may be selected from, e.g., formic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, palmitic acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, uric acid, sulfonic acid, sulfinic acid, aspartic acid, citric acid, isocitric acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, glutamic acid, or the like. The amino acid as the antioxidant may be selected from, e.g., glutamine, asparagine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine and cystine. The organic acid derivative as the antioxidant may be selected from, e.g., sodium glutamate, an ascorbic acid derivative such as ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, ascorbic acid 2-glucoside, ascorbic acid 6-palmitate, ascorbic acid 2-phosphate-6-palmitate, ascorbic acid 2-phosphate-6-hexyldecanoate and ascorbic acid 2-phosphate-6-stearate, and salts thereof. The amino acid derivative as the antioxidant may be, e.g., cysteine hydrochloride. And, the metal thiolate as the antioxidant may be, e.g., sodium thiosulfate, potassium thiosulfate, magnesium thiosulfate, or the like. In the present invention, the antioxidant is used of 1 to 40 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 30 parts by weight, more preferably 5 to 25 parts by weight, most preferably 7 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of tolterodine. Tolterodine may be in any form, including a free base and an acid addition salt. A free base is preferred considering the transdermal absorption rate of the drug. The transdermal composition according to the present invention may be prepared into such formulations as patch, liquid, ointment, gel, or the like according to a method commonly employed in the art. A patch form is preferred. In the present invention, various excipients aiding in transdermal absorption and adhesives aiding in adhesion to the skin may be used as a base of the patch. A solvent used to dissolve the drug when preparing the patch may be ethyl acetate, ethanol, propylene glycol, or the like, and may be used of 50 to 500 parts by weight tolterodine 100 parts by weight. An adhesive polymer that may be used to prepare the transdermal composition according to the present invention into a patch may be a water-based or organic solvent-based pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) for medical use. Preferably, one or more of an acryl-based adhesive such as acrylate polymer, vinyl acetate-acrylate copolymer, a synthetic rubber such as polyisobutylene, polystyrene, polybutadiene or copolymers thereof, a natural rubber, a silicone-based adhesive, or the like. Preferably, the adhesive polymer is contained in an amount of 100 to 2000 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of tolterodine. If the adhesive polymer is used less than 100 parts by weight, the added components do not form a uniform phase, thereby resulting in difficulty application, nonuniform content, decreased adhesivity, or the like. Meanwhile, if it is used exceeding 2000 parts by weight, relative contents of the drug and other additives decrease, thereby leading to significantly decreased absorption of the drug. The administration dose of the composition according to the present invention may vary depending on age, body weight, sex and physical conditions of the patient, administration route, severity of disease, or the like. An oral dosage of tolterodine for overactive bladder such as urinary frequency, urinary urgency and urge incontinence is 2 mg, twice a day. MODE FOR THE INVENTION The examples and experiments will now be described. The following examples and experiments are for illustrative purposes only and not intended to limit the scope of this invention. Reference Example 1 Stress Decomposition Test of Tolterodine Under Acidic/Basic/Oxidizing Conditions Tolterodine free base (20 mg) was added respectively to three 100 mL flasks.
