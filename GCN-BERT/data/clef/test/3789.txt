Step 3: 3-Chloro-N-[5-diethylamino-2-(5-ethylthio-[1,2,4]-thiadiazolyl-2-ylazo)-phenyl]-propionamide
2-Amino-5-ethylthio-[1,3,4]-thiadiazole (2.32 g, 0.02 mol) is added in portions to a mixture of propionic acid (10 ml) and acetic acid (20 ml) and stirred at room temperature. The resultant solution is cooled and stirred at 0-5° C. while nitrosyl sulphuric acid (6.34 g, 0.02 mol) is added dropwise. After a further hour at 0-5° C., the diazonium salt solution is added dropwise to a suspension prepared by adding a solution of 3-chloro-N-(3-diethylaminophenyl)-propionamide (5.5 g, 0.016 mol) in acetone to a stirred mixture of ice and water containing a little sulphamic acid. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight, allowing to warm up to room temperature and the product is collected by filtration, washed with cold water. After drying, the crude product is purified by silica flash chromatography and recrystallisation from methylene chloride/methylated spirits yields 3-chloro-N-[5-diethylamino-2-(5-ethylthio-[1,2,4]-thiadiazolyl-2-ylazo)-phenyl]-propionamide as crimson needles (2.5 g, 29%), λmax (EtOAc) 516 nm, ∈max 60,000, ½ band width 79 nm. The preparation is repeated on 0.015M scale, yielding 2.7 g (42%) of product.
