Embodiment of the Invention Hereunder, the surgical robot according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 5. As illustrated in FIG.1, a surgical robot 1 of the present embodiment is provided with a robot body 4 having a robot arm 3 with a tip end to which a medical instrument 2 (2A, 2B, 2C) is mounted. Note that an illustration of the robot arm 3 to which the medical instruments 2B, 2C are mounted is omitted in FIG. 1. Control information of the robot body 4 is input to a control unit 7 by an input unit 6 which is provided with a control panel 5. The control unit 7 controls the robot body 4 based on control information which is input from the input unit 6. The robot body 4 selectively operates a plurality of different kinds of medical instruments 2, and the common input unit 6 is used for a plurality of medical instruments 2. As the medical instrument 2, an instrument which clamps or cuts a surgical site or the like can be used, for example. The surgical robot 1 further has an endoscope (not illustrated) for imaging a surgical site of a patient P, and a display 8 is installed adjacent to the operation panel 5 in order to present an image obtained from the endoscope to an operator. An image of the display 8 is controlled by the control unit 7, and a display unit 9 in the surgical robot 1 of the present embodiment is configured by the display 8 and (a display control portion of) the control unit 7. In FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B, the operation panel 5 of the input unit 6 is displayed so as to be enlarged, and the operation panel 5 is provided with a selection switch (operation portion) 10 (10A, 10B, 10C) for selecting the medical instrument 2 to be used from a plurality of (three in the embodiment) medical instruments 2, a joystick (operation portion or movable operation portion) 11 for moving the selected medical instrument 2, and a startup switch (operation portion) 12 (12A, 12B, 12C, 12D) for performing various operations (four kinds in the example) by the selected medical instrument 2. The joystick 11 may be provided with the startup switch 12. Each joint of the robot arm 3 is provided with a joint angle sensor (encoder, for example) for detecting a joint angle. Information of the joint angle sensor is transmitted to the control unit 7, and the control unit 7 recognizes the attitude of the robot arm 3 based on the transmitted information. If a relative positional relation between each robot arm 3 on which each medical instrument 2 is mounted is known, the control unit 7 can recognize a relative positional relation of each medical instrument 2 and an endoscope by recognizing an attitude of each robot arm 3 as mentioned above. The control unit 7 can recognize that the medical instruments 2A, 2B, 2C on the screen correspond to which of the selection switches 10A, 10B, 10C based on the relative positional relation of the respective medical instruments 2 and the endoscope which is recognized in this manner, and an image imaged by the endoscope. Also, contact/proximity sensors (operated state detection units) 13 are provided to the joystick 11 and the startup switches 12 respectively. In addition to a mechanical sensor such as a switch or the like, various types of electric sensors including electrostatic capacitance type or the like can be used as the contact/proximity sensor 13. A detection signal of the contact/proximity sensor 13 is transmitted to the control unit 7, and thereby the operation portions 10, 11, 12 to be operated can be identified. FIG. 3 illustrates a display example of the display 8. The display unit 9 has a selected condition display function of displaying the selected condition of a plurality of medical instruments 2 on the screen. Also, the display unit 9 has a function of displaying moving directions and functions of the medical instruments 2 on the screen of the display 8. In the example illustrated in FIG. 3, the selection switch 10B of the operation panel 5 is pressed so as to select the medical instrument 2B, and a star-shaped mark (mark) 14 is displayed in the selected medical instrument 2B on the screen of the display 8. Thus, as the selected medical instrument 2B can be confirmed with the mark 14 on the display 8, the operator can easily recognize the currently selected medical instrument 2B without taking his/her eyes off the display 8. The mark 14 is displayed on the screen of the display 8 so as to be at least partially overlapped on the selected medical instrument 2B. Thereby, the selected medical instrument 2B can be easily recognized and also the mark 14 does not cut off a view, and therefore an image area of the display 8 can be used further efficiently. Also, the mark 14 which indicates the selected medical instrument 2B can be constantly displayed on the display 8, while the mark 14 may be erased when a predetermined time has passed (after one second, for example) after the mark 14 has been once displayed. Thereby, the image area of the display 8 can be used further efficiently. Also, the selected medical instrument 2B can be displayed on the screen of the display 8 with letters (letters such as "Electrosurgical Instrument", for example) as well as the display of the mark 14 which indicates the selected medical instrument 2B. Also, the mark 14 may indicate the medical instrument 2B with an arrow in addition to a pattern such as a star-shaped mark as in the example. Namely, it would be sufficient for the way of display that the selected medical instrument 2B can be distinguished from the other medical instruments 2A, 2C. Note that, when two or more medical instruments 2 are selected at the same time, the mark 14 is attached to the respective medical instruments 2. Also, the display unit 9 has a function of invalidating the selected condition display function. In some cases, the selected condition of the medical instrument 2 does not necessarily need to be displayed on the display 8 depending on the contents of a surgery performed and the type of the medical instrument 2 used. In such cases, the display function of the display 8 can be used effectively by preventing useless display on the display 8. Also, the display unit 9 has an operation contents display function of displaying operation contents of the medical instruments 2 corresponding to the operation portions 11, 12 of which operated states are detected by the contact/proximity sensors 13 which are provided to the joystick 11 and the startup switch 12. The screen of the display 8 on the left side in FIG. 4 displays a mark 15 adjacent to the selected medical instrument 2B and suggestive of operation contents (moving direction in this case) when an operator holds the joystick 11 in the state that the selection switch 10B is pressed so as to select the medical instrument 2B. On the other hand, the screen of the display 8 on the right side in FIG. 4 displays the mark 15 adjacent to the selected medical instrument 2B and suggestive of operation contents (energization to the electrosurgical instrument in this case) when an operator makes contact with the startup switch 12D in the same state that the medical instrument 2B is selected. Note that, on the screen of the display 8, the mark 15 suggestive of operation contents can be displayed so as to be at least partially overlapped on the medical instrument 2. Thereby, an operator can easily recognize operation contents of the medical instrument 2 and also the image area of the display 8 can be efficiently used as the mark 15 does not cut off a view. Also, operation contents can be displayed on the screen of the display 8 with a letter 16 ("Energization", for example) as well as display of the mark 15 suggestive of operation contents. Also, the mark 15 and the letter 16 indicating operation contents of the medical instrument 2 can be constantly displayed on the display 8, while the mark 15 and a letter 16 may be erased when a predetermined time has passed (after one second, for example) after mark 15 and a letter 16 have been displayed. Thereby, the image area of the display 8 can be used further efficiently. Also, the display unit 8 has a function of invalidating the operation contents display function. In some cases, operation contents of the medical instrument 2 do not necessarily need to be displayed on the display 8 depending on the contents of a surgery performed and the type of the medical instrument 2 used. In such cases, the display function of the display 8 can be used effectively by preventing useless display on the display 8. The screen of the display 8 on the left side in FIG. 5 displays the mark 15 adjacent to the selected medical instrument 2A and suggestive of operation contents (moving direction in this case) when an operator holds the joystick 11 in the state that the selection switch 10A is pressed so as to select the medical instrument 2A. On the other hand, the screen of the display 8 on the right side in FIG. 5 displays the mark 15 adjacent to the selected medical instrument 2A and suggestive of operation contents (operation of closing a forceps in this case) when an operator makes contact with the startup switch 12D in the same state that the medical instrument 2A is selected. As can be seen from FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, in the surgical robot 1 of the embodiment, different medical instruments (medical instruments 2A, 2B, for example) can be operated with the common startup switch (startup switch 12D, for example), and therefore the number of the startup switches 12 to be installed can be decreased. Additionally, as operation contents are displayed on the screen of the display 8 according to the selected medical instrument 2, an operator can recognize the operation contents easily even when different medical instruments 2 are operated by the common startup switch 12. As a modified example of the surgical robot 1 according to the above-described embodiment, the operation portion such as the startup switch 12 can be configured by a switch which has a first operation state and a second operation state that an operation further progresses from the first operation state, and also the operation contents display function displays operation contents of the medical instrument 2 in the first operation state. For example, when the operation portion such as the startup switch 12 is configured by a push-button type switch, the first operation state is a half-depressed state of the push-button type switch, and the second operation state is a state that the push-button type switch is depressed further from the half-depressed state. In the modified example, at the time when the operation portion (push-button type switch, for example) reaches the second operation state (state of being depressed further from the half-depressed state), the corresponding medical instrument 2 performs a predetermined operation (energization to the electrosurgical instrument, for example). As another modified example of the surgical robot 1 according to the above-described embodiment, voice guidance can be used together with the marks 14, 15 and the letter 16 by the display unit 9. Also, as the operation portions 10, 11, 12, a passive arm with multiple degrees of freedom and a grip or the like which detects gripping amount may be used in addition to the above-mentioned switch and joystick. As another modified example of the surgical robot 1 according to the above-described embodiment, the display unit 9 may further have a switch display function of displaying various switches other than the joystick 11 on the display 8 so as to operate the switches by movements of a pointer (cursor) on the display 8 and clicks. For example, as illustrated in FIGs. 6A and 6B, a pointer 17 displayed on the display 8 is moved by the joystick 11 so as to move the pointer 17 to the position of a desired switch of a slave screen 18 displayed similarly on the display 8. Here, in the example illustrated in FIG. 6A, the slave screen 18 configures a selection switch for selecting various medical instruments 2A, 2B, 2C. Once the pointer 17 is moved to the position of the desired selection switch ("Instrument B" in FIG. 6A) of the slave screen 18 by operating the joystick 11, an operation button 19 provided to an end portion of the joystick 11 is pressed so as to select a desired medical instrument. Thereby, since the star-shaped mark (mark) 14 is displayed in the selected medical instrument 2B as illustrated in FIG. 6A, an operator can easily recognize the currently selected medical instrument 2B without taking his/her eyes of the operator off the display 8. Additionally, in the modified example, an operation itself for selecting the desired medical instrument 2 can be also performed without taking his/her eyes of the operator off the display 8. Also, the selection switches 10A, 10B, 10C of the operation panel 5 can be omitted. Also, the operation button 19 provided to the end portion of the joystick 11 may be used as a startup switch for starting up the selected medical instrument 2B. In this manner, an operator can start up the desired medical instrument 2B without taking his/her eyes of the operator off the display 8. Also, the startup switches 12A, 12B, 12C, 12D of the operation panel 5 can be omitted. FIGs. 7A and 7B illustrates another modified example, and when the pointer 17 is positioned on the switch of the slave screen 18 displayed on the display 8, the medical instrument 2 concerned with the switch is specified in this modified example. For example, when the pointer 17 is positioned to a switch "x2" as illustrated in FIG. 7A, the star-shaped mark (mark) 14 is displayed in a medical instrument (medical instrument 2B in FIG. 7A) whose magnification rate becomes 2 times thereby. Here, the "magnification rate" is a magnification of operation amount of the medical instrument 2 or the like with respect to operation amount of the joystick (operation portion) 11. FIG. 8 illustrates another modified example, and a plurality of input units (consoles) 6 are provided for one surgical robot 1 in this example. In this example, three input units 6A, 6B, 6C are installed. Additionally, on the respective displays 8A, 8B, 8C of the plurality of input units 6A, 6B, 6C, common information to each other can be displayed. Therefore, operators can recognize via the displays 8 of their own that which switches of medical instruments 2 are being touched by other operators and which operation they are to perform. According to the modified example, a plurality of operators can recognize each other's operation situation without taking their eyes off their displays upon cooperating, and therefore the co-operation can be performed smoothly. Note that, although FIG. 8 illustrates an example that the displays 8 and the control units 7 are provided to the respective medical instruments 2, a common display or a control unit may be employed. As another modified example, the above-mentioned magnification rate may be the reciprocal of the display magnification of the display 8. Namely, this modified example enables an intuitive operation by maintaining operation amount of the medical instrument 2 on the display 8 with respect to certain operation amount of the joystick (operation portion) 11 regardless of display magnification. For example, operation amount of the medical instrument 2 on the display 8 when the joystick (operation portion) 11 is moved 1cm to the left is shown by the length of an arrow illustrated in FIG. 9A. On the other hand, when the display magnification of the display 8 is increased to 2, operation amount of the medical instrument 2 with respect to operation amount of the joystick (operation portion) 11 is 1/2 as the reciprocal of 2. Thereby, operation amount of the medical instrument 2 on the display 8 when the operation portion 11 is moved 1cm to the left is shown by an arrow in FIG. 9B, and it has the same length as the length of the arrow in FIG. 9A. Namely, operation amount of the medical instrument 2 on the display 8 corresponding to a fixed operation amount of the joystick (operation amount) 11 is obtained by (display magnification of display) × (1/display magnification of display) = 1 time, being constant regardless of magnification rate. Thus, as a ratio of operation amount of the medical instrument 2 on the display 8 to operation amount of the joystick (operation portion) 11 is constant regardless of display magnification, an intuitive operation becomes possible. Also, in such a case, a relation between a movable range of the joystick (operation portion) 11 and a display range of the display 8 also becomes constant, and thereby a movable range according to a display range and a display range according to a movable range can be set easily, which is advantageous on this point as well. As described above, in the surgical robot 1 according to the embodiment and the modified examples thereof, the selected medical instrument 2 and the correspondence relation between the operation portions 11, 12 of the input unit 6 and the operation contents of the medical instrument 2 are displayed on the screen of the display 8, and thereby an operator can easily judge which medical instrument 2 is selected or which operation portions 11, 12 of the input unit 6 correspond to which operation of the medical instrument 2 via the screen of the display 8, namely, without taking his/her eyes off the display 8. Note that the configuration of the present invention is not necessarily essential when the correspondence relation between the operation portions 11, 12 and the medical instrument 2 can be judged by a configuration or a method other than the present invention.
