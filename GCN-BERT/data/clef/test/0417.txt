CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/954,931 filed Jul. 30, 2013, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/133,651 filed Jun. 8, 2011, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,497,389, which is a National Stage Entry of PCT Application No. PCT/US09/67205 filed Dec. 8, 2009 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/120,742, filed Dec. 8, 2008, entitled “SINGLE STEP TRANSESTERIFICATION OF BIODIESEL FEEDSTOCK USING A GASEOUS CATALYST,” each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference as if fully set forth herein. BACKGROUND Biodiesel is a non-petroleum-based fuel made from renewable resources, for example, plants, microorganisms, or the like. It can be used as a diesel fuel substitute or as a component of fuel blends. Biodiesel is biodegradable and non-toxic, so fuel spills pose far less risk to the environment. Further, because the production of biodiesel “recycles” CO2, biodiesel production and use does not significantly contribute to global warming Chemically, biodiesel feedstock can be composed primarily of triglycerides (TGs), which can be formed from a single molecule of glycerol with three long chain fatty acids attached. The figure below shows the transesterification process whereby TGs can be converted into methyl ester biodiesel. To the feedstock can be added an alcohol, for example, methanol as exemplified here, in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction between the TGs and the alcohol is reversible, so the alcohol can be added in excess to drive the reaction and ensure complete conversion. This transesterification reaction can be catalyzed using an acidic or basic catalyst in order to maintain adequate conversion rates. Though widely used, base catalysis can suffer from limitations that can increase production costs for biodiesel. Acid catalysts can be used, but the use of strong acid catalysts can create a need for corrosion-resistant processing equipment. Additionally, the liquid acid needs to be removed after the reaction is catalyzed. As an additional constraint, liquid acid and base catalysts can call for the use of relatively “clean” feedstocks. As a result, prior to the transesterification reaction, many biodiesel feedstocks need processing, for example, lysis of microorganisms, crushing of plant matter, removal of water and free fatty acids (FFAs), or the like, or a combination thereof. These pre-transesterification steps can add cost and complexity to the biodiesel production process, and/or shift the net energy balance of production in a negative direction, which can lessen the attractiveness of biodiesel as a fuel.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the application can include a single step process for transesterification of feedstocks. The process can produce biodiesel grade, fatty acid alkyl esters. The process can include: providing reaction agents comprising a feedstock, an alcohol and a gaseous catalyst; and contacting the reaction agents, wherein the contacting results in formation of a reaction product comprising a first component comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester. The process can include the use of less-expensive feedstocks. The feedstock can comprise at least one transesterifiable lipid. The process can include the use of a feedstock with high water content. The process can include the use of a crude feedstock without complicated pre-treatment of, for example, extensive drying, degumming, or the like, or a combination thereof. As used herein, “crude” can indicate that the feedstock has not been subjected to complicated pre-treatment and/or it contains several classes of lipids (e.g. neutral lipids, phospholipids, etc.), free fatty acids, sterols, etc. The process can include the use of a gaseous catalyst. The process can include recycling of catalysts and/or unreacted alcohol. The process can be suitable for large-scale production, or small-scale product. The reaction agents can include at least one catalyst. The catalyst can increase the rate of feedstock esterification and transesterification, and/or allow for more liberal feedstock standards, and/or limit the number of reaction steps, and/or enhance the yield of the reaction process, and/or increase the safety of production workers while reducing the environmental footprint of the biodiesel production process. The catalyst can be a basic catalyst. A basic catalyst can catalyze the transesterification reaction by removing a proton from the alcohol, and can make the alcohol more reactive. The catalyst can include, for example, NaOH, KOH, MeONa, NaOCH3, Na2CH2CH3, guanidines (e.g. TBD), metal complexes of the type M(3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone)2(H2))2 where M=Sn, Zn, Pb, or Hg; liquid amine-based catalysts such as DEA, DMAE, TEMED, or TMAH, or the like, or a combination thereof. Transesterification of the lipid of the feedstock can be catalyzed by the basic catalyst. If the feedstock comprises heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids, transesterification of the heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids can be simultaneously catalyzed by the basic catalyst. The catalyst can be an acidic catalyst. An acid catalyst can catalyze the transesterification reaction by donating a proton to the alcohol, and can make the alcohol more reactive. The catalyst can include, for example, a Bronsted acid that can include a sulfonic or sulfuric type acid, H2SO4, HCl, acetyl chloride, BF3, HBr, HCN, HF, H2S, or the like, or a combination thereof. Transesterification of the lipid of the feedstock can be catalyzed by the acidic catalyst. If the feedstock comprises heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids, transesterification of the heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids can be simultaneously catalyzed by the acidic catalyst. The catalyst can include heterogeneous acidic and basic catalysts, for example, solid basic materials including MgO, Al—Mg, hydrotalcites, Cs-exchanged sepiolite, mesoporous MCM-41, heterogenized guanidines on organic polymers, sulfonic ion-exchange resin, WZA, STO, SZA, and Amberlyst-15 with sulfuric acid as catalyst. Transesterification of the lipid of the feedstock can be catalyzed by the catalyst. If the feedstock comprises heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids, transesterification of the heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids can be simultaneously catalyzed by the catalyst. The at least one catalyst can include a liquid catalyst, a solid catalyst, or a gaseous catalyst, or a combination thereof. Transesterification of the lipid of the feedstock can be catalyzed by the catalyst. If the feedstock comprises heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids, transesterification of the heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids can be simultaneously catalyzed by the catalyst. The catalyst can include a gaseous catalyst. The gaseous catalyst can be acidic, for example, Bronsted acid that can include a sulfonic or sulfuric type acid, H2SO4, HCl, acetyl chloride, BF3, HBr, HCN, HF, H2S, or the like, or a combination thereof. The concentration of the catalyst can be from about 0.01 M to about 100 M, or from about 0.1 M to about 50 M, or from about 0.5 M to about 20 M, or from about 0.8 M to about 10 M, or from about 1 M to about 5 M, or from about 1 M to about 3 M. The concentration of the catalyst can be lower than about 100 M, or lower than about 50 M, or lower than about 30 M, or lower than about 20 M, or lower than about 10 M, or lower than about 8 M, or lower than about 6 M, or lower than about 5 M, or lower than about 4 M, or lower than about 3 M, or lower than about 2 M, or lower than about 1 M. As used herein, “about” can indicate ±20% variation of the value it describes. The concentration of the catalyst can refer to the concentration of the effective catalyst composition(s). Merely by way of example, if a catalyst is generated in situ, the concentration of the catalyst can refer to that of the generated catalyst. Merely by way of example, the catalyst can include gaseous HCl. HCl gas can be provided in the form of anhydrous methanolic HCl. HCl gas can be generated in situ by mixing other reaction agents, for example, the feedstock, with H2SO4 and NaCl. The concentration of HCl gas can be from about 0.01 M to about 100 M, or from about 0.1 M to about 50 M, or from about 0.5 M to about 20 M, or from about 0.8 M to about 10 M, or from about 1 M to about 5 M, or from about 1 M to about 3 M. The concentration of the catalyst can be lower than about 100 M, or lower than about 50 M, or lower than about 30 M, or lower than about 20 M, or lower than about 10 M, or lower than about 8 M, or lower than about 5 M. If HCl is generated in situ by, for example, H2SO4 and NaCl, H2SO4 and NaCl can be provided at a ratio of from about 100:1 to about 1:100, or from about 50:1 to about 1:50, or from about 20:1 to about 1:20, or from about 10:1 to about 1:10, or from about 5:1 to about 1:5. Merely by way of example, H2SO4 can be provided at about 3 M, and NaCl at about 1 M, and HCl gas can be generated in situ by mixing the feedstock with such provided H2SO4 and NaCl. As used herein, “in situ” means that a catalyst is generated in the reaction chamber, and not added exogenously. Merely by way of example, HCl gas can be generated in situ by combining H2SO4 and NaCl in the reaction chamber. Transesterification of the lipid of the feedstock can be catalyzed by HCl gas. If the feedstock comprises heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids, transesterification of the heterogeneous transesterifiable lipids can be simultaneously catalyzed by HCl gas. A method of generating gaseous HCl can be found, for example, in the article entitled “Best method for hydrochloric acid gas” available at http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/index.html, which is incorporated herein by reference. It is understood that the example regarding HCl gas as the catalyst is provided for illustration purposes only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the application. Other catalysts, such as, basic catalysts, other acid catalysts, in form of a gas, liquid or solid, can be used in the process and/or the system described herein to catalyze the transesterification of a feedstock to generate a product comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester. The reaction agents can include an alcohol. The alcohol can include, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol, nonanol, decanol, or the like, or a combination thereof.

A transesterification reaction involving a feedstock and an alcohol to generate a product comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester can be reversible. The alcohol can be provided in stoichiometric excess relative to the lipid content of the feedstock that can be transesterified. This can shift the reaction equilibrium toward the desired direction, e.g. the right direction in the exemplary overall reaction shown above, and/or speed up the reaction, and/or improve the final yield. The concentration of the alcohol can be in stoichiometric excess relative to the lipid content of the feedstock that can be transesterified. The molar ratio of alcohol to transesterifiable lipid can be at least about 3:1, or at least about 5:1, or at least about 10:1, or at least about 20:1, or at least about 25:1, or at least about 50:1, or at least about 100:1, or at least about 200:1, or at least about 500:1, or at least about 1000:1, or at least about 2000:1, or at least about 5000:1, or at least about 10,000:1, or at least about 25,000:1, or at least about 50,000:1.

Merely by way of example, the mass source can include microalgae, yeast, bacteria, oil-seeds, plant matter, animal fats, or the like, or a combination thereof. The mass source may or may not be pre-treated before being used as the feedstock. The pre-treatment can include, for example, separation of the biomass from growth media, additional drying of the feedstock, physical or mechanical pulverization to increase the surface area of the feedstock, preheat, or the like, or a combination thereof. The feedstock can comprise lower than about 90% (% w/w), or lower than about 80% (% w/w), or lower than about 70% (% w/w), or lower than about 60% (% w/w), or lower than about 50% (% w/w), or lower than about 40% (% w/w), or lower than about 30% (% w/w), or lower than about 20% (% w/w), or lower than about 10% (% w/w), or lower than about 8% (% w/w), or lower than about 5% (% w/w), or lower than about 2% (% w/w), or lower than about 1% (% w/w), or lower than about 0.5% (% w/w) of water.

The process for transesterification of feedstocks to produce biodiesel grade, fatty acid alkyl esters can further include mixing the reaction agents comprising the feedstock, the alcohol and the catalyst. The mixing can essentially coincide with the contacting. The mixing can occur during a partial period of contacting.

The reaction product can include at least a second component comprising a material selected from a glycerol, a protein, a pigment, a biopolymer, a carbohydrate, and a fatty acid. The second component can include an omega-three fatty acid. The reaction product can be used for non fuel applications, for example, wood finish, bases for cosmetic and burn creams, essential oils, lamp oil, and nutraceuticals. Depending upon the structural composition of the fatty acids (for example, carbon chain length, degree of saturation, number and place of double bonds) as well as whether the fatty acids are available in free form or in the form of a triglyceride, some components of the reaction product can have additional uses in, for example, facial or burn creams, cosmetic creams, wound creams, food supplements, waxes, or as a fuel. Some component of the reaction product, for example, the first component comprising the fatty acid alkyl esters, can be used as biodiesel, or can be further processed to higher value fuels (for example, jet fuel) through a variety of catalytic processes, or converted to methyl or ethyl fatty acid esters via acid or base catalyzed transesterification reactions. The reaction product can include the unreacted alcohol. The reaction product can include the catalyst.

Merely by way of example, the reaction product can include a first phase including the first component comprising the transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester, and a second phase including the second component comprising a glycerol, a protein, or other non-convertible matter, or a combination thereof. The first phase can be immiscible with the second phase. The first component of the reaction product can be separated from the second component by separating the two immiscible phases. The second component in the second phase can include, for example, glycerol, and can be separated, and/or stored in, for example, a storage tank. The separated first component comprising the transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester can be stored and/or further purified, e.g. by distillation. The distillation can be performed at a temperature from about 20° C. to about 200° C., or from about 50° C. to about 180° C., or from about 60° C. to about 150° C., or from about 70° C. to about 130° C., or from about 80° C. to about 120° C., or from about 90° C. to about 110° C.

The distillation can be performed at a pressure from about 0.01 bar to about 10 bar, or from about 0.1 bar to about 8 bar, or from about 0.3 bar to about 5 bar, or from about 0.5 bar to about 3 bar. The separated first component, with or without further purification, comprising the transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester can be condensed and/or stored. The separated second component can be drained to a storage tank, and can be further processed. The separated first component comprising the transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester can be further processed by, e.g. distillation, or other reaction, or the like, or a combination thereof, to improve, e.g., its quality, purity and/or fuel grade, or a combination thereof. Merely by way of example, the separated first component comprising the transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester can be converted to higher value fuels (for example, jet fuel) through a variety of catalytic processes. The separated second component can be drained to a storage tank, and can be further processed. Merely by way of example, glycerol can be separated from the rest of the second component comprising protein, and/or other non-convertible matter. Glycerol can be further processed. Merely by way of example, glycerol can be reacted in the presence of an alkene (for example, isobutylene) to form alkyl ethers of glycerol. Alkyl ethers for example, di-tert-butylglycerols (DTBG) and tri-tert-butylglycerol (TTBG) are valuable as fuel additives. The reaction product can include a second component comprising a protein, a carbohydrate, or the like, or a combination thereof. The process can include separating the second component including the protein and/or the carbohydrate from the reaction product. The protein and/or the carbohydrate can separated from the reaction product by, for example, filtration, centrifugation, salt precipitation, phase separation, or the like, or a combination thereof, before, during or after any of the separation procedures described above. Merely by way of example, the reaction product can be filtered to separate the composition(s) in solid form from that/those in gas and/or liquid form before the further procedure(s) to separate the compositions in gas and/or liquid form.

The process can including separating any one of these or other compositions of the reaction produce from the reaction product by, for example, centrifugation, extraction by an organic solvent (e.g. hexane), or the like, or a combination thereof. Merely by way of example, in the event that organic solvent extraction is employed, the extracted compositions of the reaction produce can be separated from the organic solvent by evaporating the solvent from the composition under vacuum. The reaction product can be used as feedstock for a repeated transesterification reaction to improve the efficiency of transesterifiable lipid in the feedstock. Merely by way of example, the reaction product before or after any of the separation procedures described above can be used as the feedstock for a repeated transesterification reaction such that more transesterifiable lipid in the feedstock can be transesterified than that transesterified in a single transesterification reaction. The process can be performed in batch mode. Merely by way of example, a batch of feedstock can be transesterified, the reaction product can be collected, and different components of the reaction product can be separated, at least some of the apparatuses involved in the process can be emptied and/or cleaned; then the cycle repeated for another batch of feedstock. The process can be performed essentially continuously. The feedstock can be fed to the process to be transesterified, the reaction product can be collected, and different components of the reaction product can be separated, essentially continuously. The process can be stopped periodically, e.g. once a day, or once a week, or once every two weeks, or once a month, or once every two months, or once three months, or once every four months, or once six months, or once a year or longer. The process can resume after at least some of the apparatuses involved in the process are maintained, e.g. emptied and/or cleaned. The process can involve multiple apparatuses of the same function, e.g. two vaporizers for distillation, such that the process can continue by using the alternate one while the other one is being maintained. Some part of the process can be performed essentially continuously, while the other part can be performed in batch mode. Merely by way of example, the transesterification reaction can be performed essentially continuously, while the separation and purification of the reaction product can be performed in batch mode. The operation mode including the batch mode, or a continuous mode, or a combination thereof, can be pre-selected. The operation mode can be adjusted in real time. Merely by way of example, the operation mode can be adjusted in real time based on the real-time operation parameters, real-time measurements regarding, for example, quality and/or quantity of the reaction product, a user's instruction, an instruction from a centralized and/or remote control center, or the like, or a combination thereof. As one example, the process can involve one reactor for the transesterification and two vaporisers for biodiesel purification, wherein the pre-selected operation mode can include that the process can run essentially continuously, at any single time point only one of the two vaporizers is used, and that the process can switch to use the other vaporizer while the first one is emptied and maintained every month. As another example, the process can involve one reactor for the transesterification and two vaporisers for biodiesel purification, wherein the operation mode can include that the process can run essentially continuously, at any single time point only one of the two vaporizers is used; however, the process can switch to use the other vaporizer based on a user's instruction, or when the quality of the purified biodiesel is measured to be substandard, or when the performance of the vaporizer is substandard, or the like, or a combination thereof.

As used herein, the shape does not indicate the orientation of the reaction chamber. Merely by way of example, if the reaction chamber is in the shape essentially of a cone whose cross-sectional area is tapering along its longitudinal axis, the portion with smaller cross-sectional area can be the top portion of the reaction chamber, or it can be the bottom portion of the reaction chamber.

As another example, the reaction chamber can include a jacket. The jacket can include a medium with a temperature and/or heat capacity and/or flowrate so as to maintain the desired temperature within the reaction chamber. The medium can include at least one material selected from water, gas, oil, or the like, or a combination thereof. Merely by way of example, the reaction chamber can include a water jacket. The temperature difference between the medium within the jacket and the desired temperature within the reaction chamber can be at least about 0.1° C., or about 1° C., or about 5° C., or about 10° C., or about 15° C., or about 20° C., or about 25° C., or larger than about 25° C. The temperature of the medium within the jacket can be higher or lower than the desired temperature within the reaction chamber, depending on whether heat needs to be added to or removed from the reaction chamber. The contacting surfaces where the jacket and the reaction chamber contact can be configured such that heat transfer is facilitated and/or enhanced. The reaction chamber can further comprise a coating or vacuum as described above to reduce undesired energy exchange (e.g. heat dissipation if the desired temperature within the reaction chamber is higher than the ambient temperature, or heat absorption if the desired temperature within the reaction chamber is lower than the ambient temperature) between the reaction chamber and the ambient. The pressure within the reaction chamber can be controlled by, for example, temperature within the reaction chamber, a pressure pump, pressure and/or flowrate of the reaction agents and/or reaction product, or the like, or a combination thereof. The reaction chamber can include sealable ports through which can pass, for example, tubing, wiring, fiber optic cable, sampling devices, liquid, solids, gases, or the like. The ports can be gated with, for example, a valve, or the like. The flow through the ports can be controlled. The control of the ports can be synchronized. At least some of the ports can be controlled independently from the other ports. The reaction agents can enter the reaction chamber from one or separate ports. The reaction agents can be brought into contact outside the reaction chamber and enter the reaction chamber as mixture through one or more ports. The reaction agents can enter the reaction chamber from separate ports and can be brought into contact within the reaction chamber. The reaction agents can be gravity-fed into the reaction chamber, or delivered on a conveyor, or delivered by a pump, or shoveled into the reaction chamber, or poured into the reaction chamber, or allowed to multiply or generate inside the reaction chamber, or the like, or a combination thereof. The reaction product can exit the reaction chamber through one or more ports. The reaction product can exit the reaction chamber through one or more ports and be separated outside the reaction chamber. Different phases of the reaction product can exit through separate ports from the reaction chamber. Merely by way of example, the reaction product can include a first phase including the first component comprising the transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester, and a second phase including the second component comprising a glycerol, a protein, or other non-convertible matter, or a combination thereof, wherein the first phase can be immiscible with the second phase. The first phase including the first component and the second phase including the second component can exit the reaction chamber from separate ports. The port(s) through which the reaction product can exit the reaction chamber can locate below the gas/liquid interface of the reaction agents and/or reaction product. This can reduce the amount of catalyst removed from the reaction chamber. The reaction product can exit the reaction chamber driven by, for example, gravity, a pump, or the like, or a combination thereof. The reaction product can be filtered upon or after exiting the reaction chamber. The filtration can be performed using, e.g. one or a series of filters. The component recovered by the filtration can be discarded, or can be used with or without further processing if a valuable composition, e.g. a protein, and/or carbohydrate, is present. The system can include more than one reaction chamber. Merely by way of example, the system can include 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or more reaction chambers.

At least some of the ports can be controlled independently from the other ports. The location of a port can be chosen depending on the properties of the component(s) which can pass through. Merely by way of example, a port through which a component in gas form can pass can be located around the top portion of the vessel, while a port through which a component in liquid and/or solid form can pass can be located around the bottom portion of the vessel or below the gas/liquid interface. The reaction product can exit the vessel driven by, for example, gravity, a pump, or the like, or a combination thereof. The reaction product can be filtered upon or after exiting the vessel. The filtration can be performed using, e.g. one or a series of filters.

The system can include more than one vessel. Merely by way of example, the system can include 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or more such vessels. In certain embodiments the arrayed vessels can be interconnected via, for example, hollow tubing, electrical wiring, fiber optic cable, or the like, or a combination thereof. The vessels can also include one or more ports for removing the reaction product. The one or more ports can be gated with, for example, a valve, or the like. Some of the vessels can be in parallel connection and can perform the same function. Such parallel connected vessels can operate simultaneously, or alternately. Some of the vessels can be in serial connection and perform different functions. Merely by way of example, the vessel(s) in serial connection with but downstream from another vessel(s) can perform further processing, e.g. further purification, of the reaction product. The operation parameter in a vessel, including, for example, temperature, pressure, flowrate, or the like, or a combination thereof, can be chosen based on the specific function of the vessel. The reaction chamber and at least one vessel can be in fluid communication via a closable and/or controllable fluid connection.

It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples that follow represent approaches discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the application, and thus can be considered to constitute examples of modes for its practice.

Example 1 Method of Growing Algae and Processing Feedstock Six shallow, parallel troughs oriented from north to south are prepared by hand using shovels. The total length of each of the troughs is approximately 100′. The total area used in the example is approximately 50′ by 100′. Into each trough is placed an unfilled 100′ bioreactor pipe extruded from polyethylene plastic. Prepared media is added to the bioreactor pipes until the bioreactor pipes are substantially full. Urea is used as a nitrogen source, and a urease enzyme is added as well. The bioreactor pipes are inoculated by opening the valve located between a “nursery” bioreactor and the bioreactor pipes. The algal strain used for inoculation is Pseudochlorococcum sp. The culture is allowed to grow until growth slows, as indicated by an increase in turbidity as well as a plateau in cell counts per mL of culture. About 5000 L of algal culture is then centrifuged at about 5 k rpm for about 10 minutes to pellet the algal bodies. The pelleted algal bodies are removed and dried, and the TG content of the resulting feedstock is determined. About 0.1 m3 of the dried algal biomass is added to an about 1000 L reaction chamber. The chamber is surrounded by a water jacket connected to a pump and a heating element, which are used to raise the chamber to a temperature of about 55° C. Catalyst (HCl) is prepared by bubbling 100% HCl from a cylinder into 1% N anhydrous methanol, and the methanol/HCl is then added to the reaction chamber in a ratio of 6 parts catalyst to 1 part of the dried algal biomass. The reaction chamber is maintained at about 55° C. for about 4 hours, then the reaction product is filtered and transferred via hollow tubing to a water jacketed chamber for a distillation step. The solids retained by the filter consist of biomeal with a protein content approaching about 65% of the initial algal biomass. This biomeal is dried and can be used as feed. The separated reaction product is heated to about 65° C. inside the water-jacketed chamber. This distillation step is performed to remove the methanol/HCl, which is recovered and can be reused in subsequent reactions. Following the distillation step, the chamber containing the filtered reaction product is cooled to about 25° C. Petroleum ether is added at a ratio of 5 parts ether to 1 part of the filtered reaction product. This mixture is incubated at room temperature for about 4 hours to extract the biodiesel. Following the incubation step, the supernatant (containing the biodiesel) is removed and heated to about 60° C. to remove the petroleum ether, which can be reused in subsequent reactions. The residual solution is biodiesel, and can be evaluated via FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) analysis to determine its specific chemical profile. Example 2 Method of Processing Algal Feedstock Referring to FIG. 1, the biomass feedstock is added to two 5 L reaction chambers (10) (upper left). The chambers are jacketed to allow for the flow of heated water around the reaction chamber to maintain a constant reaction temperature. After the reaction is complete, the chambers are drained from their lower ends, with the drain tubes (15) coming together in a Y-connector (20). The reaction product is drained to the distillation vessel (30) (middle-left of FIG. 1) where the temperature of the reaction product is raised to distill off the methanol/HCl catalyst. The catalyst is collected (middle-right of FIG. 1) in a chilled chamber (40) for re-use. Following distillation, petroleum ether is added to the reaction product (middle-left of FIG. 1) via a 3-way adaptor (50). After mixing, the material can drain out from the bottom of the distillation vessel (30), through a condenser tube (60), through a Buchner filter, and into a collection flask (70) (bottom of FIG. 1). The material is then transferred into a rotovap (80) (bottom-right of FIG. 1) to be evaporated, leaving the processed biodiesel product. About 10 microliters aliquot of the biodiesel product is added to about 500 microliters heptane containing methyl ester standard (C:15) and FAME analysis is performed with gas chromatography equipment. Example 3 Method of Processing Ground Meat Feedstock About 50 g of dried ground beef is added to about 100 mL of methanol. The mixture is stirred for about an hour at about 60° C. About 300 mL of 3N Methanol/HCl is added to the mixture, and the stirring continues for about 3 additional hours. The reaction is then filtered through glass fiber filters and the resulting filtrate is heated to about 65° C. for about 15 minutes to “flash” evaporate the methanol and HCl. About 150 mL of petroleum ether is added to the flashed reaction and mixed. After about 4 hours, the supernatant is removed and flash evaporated at about 70° C.+ to remove non-biodiesel material. About 10 microliters aliquot of the biodiesel product is added to about 500 microliters heptane containing methyl ester standard (C:15) and FAME analysis is performed with gas chromatography equipment. Example 4 Method of Processing Yellow Grease Feedstock About 50 g of yellow grease is added to about 100 mL of methanol. The mixture is stirred for about an hour at about 60° C. About 300 mL of 3N Methanol/HCl is added to the mixture, and the stirring continues for about 3 additional hours. The reaction is then filtered through glass fiber filters and the resulting filtrate is heated to about 65° C. for about 15 minutes to “flash” evaporate the methanol and HCl. About 150 mL of petroleum ether is added to the flashed reaction and mixed. After 4 hours, the supernatant is removed and flash evaporated at about 70° C.+ to remove non-biodiesel material. About 10 microliters aliquot of the biodiesel product is added to about 500 microliters heptane containing methyl ester standard (C:15) and FAME analysis is performed with gas chromatography equipment.

FAME analysis was performed with gas chromatography equipment using the reaction product similarly to that described in Example 6. Total algae oil was obtained from chloroform/methanol extraction. Base catalysis did not work with these samples due to high phospholipids and glycolipids. The process efficiently converted the fatty acid conjugates of neutral lipids, phospholipids and glycolipids. The obtained FAME data (shown in FIG. 5) shows the chemical profile of the biodiesel produced. The results indicate that the single-step transesterification process can convert algae total lipids feedstock comprising fatty acid conjugates of neutral lipids, phospholipids, and glycolipids. Example 11 FAME Analysis on Single-Step Transesterification of Sea Weed Feedstock Sea weed feedstock including algae leaves was processed similarly to that described in Example 6. FAME analysis was performed with gas chromatography equipment using the reaction product similarly to that described in Example 6. Sea weeds can be a potential very low cost feed stock. While the lipid content was low in these samples including algae leaves (less than about 5%) the process was efficient in converting the phospholipids and neutral lipids as evidenced by the presence of Eicosatetraenoate (arachidonate) [20:4] and linoleneate [18:3], both of which are fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The obtained FAME data (shown in FIG. 6) shows the chemical profile of the biodiesel produced. The results indicate that the single-step transesterification process can convert sea weed feedstock comprising the phospholipids and neutral lipids. Example 12 FAME Analysis on Single-Step Transesterification of Sea Weed Feedstock Sea weed feedstock including algae buds was processed similarly to that described in Example 6. FAME analysis was performed with gas chromatography equipment using the reaction product similarly to that described in Example 6. Sea weeds can be a potential very low cost feed stock. The process was efficient in converting the phospholipids and neutral lipids as evidenced by the presence of Eicosatetraenoate (arachidonate) [20:4], Eicosapentaenoic acid [20:5] and linoleneate [18:3], all of which are fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The obtained FAME data (shown in FIG. 7) shows the chemical profile of the biodiesel produced. The results indicate that the single-step transesterification process can convert sea weed feedstock comprising the phospholipids and neutral lipids. Example 13 FAME Analysis on Single-Step Transesterification of Glycolipid Feedstock Glycolipid feedstock was processed similarly to that described in Example 6. FAME analysis was performed with gas chromatography equipment using the reaction product similarly to that described in Example 6. The obtained FAME data (shown in FIG. 8) shows the chemical profile of the biodiesel produced. The results indicate that the single-step transesterification process can convert glycolipid feedstock. Example 14 FAME Analysis on Single-Step Transesterification of Brown Grease Feedstock Brown grease feedstock was processed similarly to that described in Example 6. FAME analysis was performed with gas chromatography equipment using the reaction product similarly to that described in Example 6. The brown grease sample had about 38% water. The obtained FAME data (shown in FIG. 9) shows the chemical profile of the biodiesel produced. The process tolerates a high percentage of water in the sample. The recommended water content is less than about 10% for efficiency. Example 15 FAME Analysis on Single-Step Transesterification of Brown Grease Feedstock Brown grease feedstock was processed similarly to that described in Example 6. FAME analysis was performed with gas chromatography equipment using the reaction product similarly to that described in Example 6. The brown grease sample had about 38% water.

Example 24 Comparison of an Exemplary Process and Single-Step Process to Generate Biodiesel FIG. 18A and FIG. 18B illustrate a comparison of an exemplary current process and single-step process (or referred to as one-step processs) to generate biodiesel using palm oil. FIG. 18A shows an exemplary process of producing biodiesel using crude palm oil as the feedstock. The process can include: providing the crude palm oil as the feedstock, refining and degumming the crude palm oil, performing transesterification reaction to generate biodiesel, refining the biodiesel, and collecting the biodiesel. FIG. 18B shows an exemplary embodiment of the single-step process (or referred to as one-step processs) described herein of producing biodiesel using crude palm oil as the feedstock. The process can include: providing the crude palm oil and gum, performing single-step transesterification reaction to generate biodiesel, refining the biodiesel, and collecting the biodiesel. The feedstock including the crude palm oil and gum does not need to be refined and/or degummed before the transesterification reaction. The process can eliminate rendering process cost (degumming), and/or reserve more feedstock, and/or increase the yield. Example 25 Exemplary System for Producing Biodiesel Grade, Fatty Acid Alkyl Esters An exemplary system for producing biodiesel grade, fatty acid alkyl esters can comprise a reactor, and a separator, wherein the separator is in fluid communication with the reactor through a fluid connection. The reactor can be adapted to facilitate a reaction among the reaction agents including the feedstock, the alcohol, and the gaseous catalyst producing a reaction product comprising unreacted alcohol (e.g. methanol), the catalyst (e.g., a HCl gas), a first component comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester, and a second component comprising glycerine (also referred to as glycerol). The reaction product can flow from the reactor to the separators through a port located at the bottom portion of the reactor. At least part of the reaction product can returned to the reactor for a repeated reaction in the reactor. The separator can be adapted to separate unreacted alcohol and catalyst from the reaction product by fractional distillation. The unreacted alcohol and catalyst can exit the separator from the port located on the top portion of the separator. The separated unreacted alcohol, with or without catalyst, can be reused in the reaction. The reaction product comprising a first component comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester, and a second component comprising glycerine can exit the separator through a port located at the bottom portion of the separator, and the first component and the second component can be separated in another vessel by, for example, phase separation, fractional distillation, or the like, or a combination thereof. If the first component comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester exists in the first phase, and the second component comprising glycerine exists in the second phase, and the first phase and the second phase are immiscible, then the first component and the second component can be separated by, for example, by exiting the separator through separate ports. After the phase separation, the first component and the second component can be further processed, respectively.

Example 28 Exemplary System for Producing Biodiesel Grade, Fatty Acid Alkyl Esters An exemplary system for producing biodiesel grade, fatty acid alkyl esters can include a reactor, a separator, a methanol day tank, a vaporiser, a biodiesel day tank and a control system. There are some parts and the fluid communication among these and other parts but not specifically pointed out and/or described. The reactor is adapted to facilitate a reaction among the reaction agents including the feedstock, the alcohol, and the gaseous catalyst producing a reaction product comprising unreacted alcohol (e.g. methanol), catalyst (e.g., a HCl gas), a first component comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester, and a second component comprising glycerine (also referred to as glycerol). The reaction product can flow from the reactor to the separator through a port located at the bottom portion of the reactor. At least part of the reaction product can be returned to the reactor for a repeated reaction in the reactor. The system can include a filter such that the reaction product exiting the reactor can be filtered before entering the separator to separate the solid reaction product from the gas and/or liquid reaction product. The solid reaction product can include protein, carbohydrate, or other non-convertible matter. The separator is adapted to separate unreacted alcohol and catalyst from the reaction product by fractional distillation. The unreacted alcohol and catalyst can exit the separator from the port located on the top portion of the separator and can be condensed and/or stored in the methanol day tank. The separated unreacted alcohol, with or without catalyst, can be reused in the reaction. The methanol day tank can be located at an elevated level compared to the separator. The reaction product comprising a first component comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester, and a second component comprising glycerine can exit the separator through a port located at the bottom portion of the separator, and the first component and the second component can be separated in another vessel by, for example, phase separation, fractional distillation, or the like, or a combination thereof. If the first component comprising a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester exists in the first phase, and the second component comprising glycerine exists in the second phase, and the first phase and the second phase are immiscible, then the first component and the second component can be separated by, for example, by exiting the separator through separate ports. After the phase separation, the first component and the second component can be further processed, respectively. The following description exemplifies the situation when the first component comprising a biodiesel (e.g., a transesterified fatty acid alkyl ester) exists in the first phase, and the second component comprising glycerine exists in the second phase, and the first phase and the second phase are immiscible. The first component and the second component can be separated by, for example, by exiting the separator through separate ports. After the phase separation, the first component can be further processed and/or purified in the vaporiser by fractional distillation. The processed and/or purified biodiesel can be delivered to the biodiesel day tank for storage. The vaporiser can be located at an elevated level compared to the separator. The second component comprising glycerine (also referred to as glycerol) can exit the separator from a port located at the bottom portion of the separator. The second component can be further processed. The system can include a filter such that the first component and/or the second component exiting the separator can be filtered to separate the solid reaction product from the gas and/or liquid reaction product. The solid reaction product can include protein, carbohydrate, or other non-convertible matter. Example 29 Exemplary Reaction Chamber FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary reaction chamber which can be used in a system described herein for producing biodiesel grade, fatty acid alkyl esters. Table 13 and Table 14 summarize the technical specification of the reaction chamber exemplified in FIG. 23. The reaction chamber can be mounted on 4 supports. The reaction chamber can include a cooling jacket (500) and a baffle (535), and sonicators (540). The reaction chamber can include a power line inside the reaction chamber, e.g. a power line for the sonicators (540). The power line can include a protection layer. For example, the power line can be wrapped within a pipe, or the like. The protection layer can insulate and/or protect the power line from the reaction agents in the reaction chamber. The reaction product comprising at least unreacted alcohol (e.g., methanol), the catalyst (e.g., an acidic catalyst) and glycerol, can exit through ports located at the bottom portion of the reaction chamber. The unreacted alcohol can be separated from the reaction product (505). The mixture of unreacted alcohol and catalyst can be separated from the reaction product (515). The glycerol and drain (510) can be separated from the reaction product for cleaning. At least part of the reaction product can return to the reaction chamber for mixing through the recirculation line (520). The reaction can be monitored by sampling the reaction agents and/or reaction product at 525 and/or 530.
