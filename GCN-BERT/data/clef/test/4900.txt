TITLE OF THE INVENTION Device Providing Enlargement & Preventing Collapse of the Pupil of the Eye CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to Application 225/KOL/2013 filed at Patent Office, India (IN), on February 27, 2013. DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION: The present invention is in the field of ophthalmic surgery and relates to an improvement in the device for mechanical enlargement or dilation of the pupil of the eye during surgery. During phacoemulsification surgery and vitreo-retinal surgery, when the pupil does not dilate with medicated drops, a device is required for mechanical enlargement of the pupil. Such a device has to maintain the pupil in the enlarged state and prevent it from collapsing for the entire duration of the surgery. Removal of the device returns the pupil to an unenlarged state to preserve its function and cosmesis. Eyes with non-dilating pupils are often also associated with floppiness of the iris, which poses additional difficulty during surgery. In phacoemulsification surgery for cataract, a 1.6 to 2.8 mm incision in the side of the cornea is required to insert a phaco probe. Smaller incisions result in secure and astigmatically neutral wounds translating into better visual outcomes. Vitreo-retinal surgery requires 0.6 mm or smaller incisions in the sclera to insert instruments into the eye. Since a corneal incision is not required, such an incision, only to insert a pupil-dilating device, should be as small as possible. Current devices in use for pupillary dilation require a 2.2 to 2.5 mm incision for insertion into the eye. They snag the incision because of gaps or pockets at the comers, which have a biplanar structure with a top and bottom part. Such snagging makes removal of the device difficult and causes damage to the cornea. They require precise alignment to engage the pupillary margin into the small narrow wedge shaped gaps or pockets at the comers. This is particularly difficult because the surgeon has a top view and the device itself obscures view of the narrow gap, which is at the side of the device. The gaps or pockets have two structural planes having an upper and lower part making the comers thick and bulky. The gaps or pockets hold the pupillary margin and iris tissue passively and the pupillary margin can easily disengage during surgical manipulations. Such continuous ring devices have been disclosed in US Patent 8323296, Dec 4 2012 by Malyugin, US Patent Application publication 2012/0269786, Nov 15 2012 by Dusek and US Patent Application publication 2013/0096386, Apr 18 2013 by Christensen & Colvard. Though discontinuous ring devices have been disclosed in US Patent 5163419, Nov 17 1992 by Goldman, US Patent 5267553, Dec 7 1993 by Graether, US Patent 6620098, Sept 16 2003 by Milverton and US Patent 6648819, Nov 18 2003 by Lee, these devices have not found acceptance because of larger incision size required, cumbersome manipulations involved and loose engagement. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION: The principal object of the present invention is to provide a device to enlarge the pupil of the eye, which requires a very small incision for insertion into the eye. Another object of the invention is to provide a device with a mechanism to engage the pupillary margin that will not snag the incision during insertion or removal. A further object of the invention is to provide a device, with an easier mechanism to engage the pupillary margin that does not require precise alignment of the pupillary margin into the narrow wedge shaped gaps or pockets at the sides of the device. A further object of the invention is to provide a device, with comers that can engage the pupillary margin but are slim and strictly in the same plane of the device. A further object of the invention is to provide a device, which not only enlarges the pupil, but also remains securely, yet reversibly fastened to iris tissue so that surgical manipulations do not lead to its disengagement. A further object of the invention is to provide a device that reduces floppiness of the Iris, which is often associated with non-dilating pupils. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: The present invention is a device to enlarge and prevent collapse, of the pupil of the eye, during surgery. The notches and flanges, on the same plane of a continuous or discontinuous ring, used to engage the pupillary margin, is the novelty of the present invention. The notches are at comers and alternate with side elements or flanges along the perimeter of the ring. The notches are open outwards with a blind receptacle inwards. Notches engage different parts of the pupillary margin and push them apart, resulting in sustained enlargement of the pupil. The flanges are formed from broad loops of the strand and are directed outwards. The device is made of a strand of any resiliently flexible material. Thermally treated 4-0 nylon suture (0.15 to 0.17 mm) is such. Notches temporarily straighten as they pass through the incision allowing the device to be inserted through a very small incision. The device, having no gaps or pockets, being entirely disposed in a single plane, passes through the incision without snagging. The device bends the pupillary margin and iris at the notches and flanges, somewhat like a paper clip, creating a secure engagement. The iris being flexible, can tolerate such bending without any damage. The flanges lying in front of the iris reduce its floppiness by restricting the billowing effect. Within the scope of the same inventive concept, variations in design are necessary, to allow the surgeon choices depending on the nature of the surgery, size of the eye, depth of the anterior chamber, associated co morbidity, size of incision, initial pupil size, desired pupil size etc. Variations in design are also necessary to suit different manufacturing capabilities. The continuous form of the ring is in the form of a polygon with at least three sides and can be with or without a joint. The ends are joined by knotting or tying of the ends, or by chemical, thermal or ultrasonic bonding of the ends or by any other method. When made by molding, stamping or other methods there is no joint. The discontinuous form of the ring has at least three sides, two comers and four notches. This form requires a much smaller incision for insertion. In one of the form of the invention, the ring has alternate side elements or flanges gently tilted backwards, enabling easy tucking of the flange under the iris. Notches are formed by an inward loop of the strand at the comers or by an inward loop of the strand between two outward digit shaped protruded loops of the strand. In one form of the invention, the comers of the ring have two adjacent notches. Positioning holes on the device help in manipulations of the device. When the device is made of expansible material, it enlarges to a larger size after insertion. The ring device is configured to adapt one or more selected configurations from a folded, extended or deformed configuration, allowing insertion through small incisions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS 140 The relevant features of existing devices and the novelty of the present invention, is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, throughout which, like reference numerals indicate corresponding parts ΐη the various figures. Fig. 1 shows an enlarged diagrammatic top perspective of the ring of the type disclosed in Malyugin US Patent 8323296, Dec 4, 2012. The Malyugin ring 1 has 145 a square configuration with four helical loops 2, 3, 4 and 5 formed by one complete turn of the strand and separated by sides 6, 7, 8 and 9 The two ends 10 and 11, of the ring have indented portions and are butt attached to each other by adhesive at the joint 12. Each loop has a wedge shaped gap 13 and 14, which faces the periphery of the ring, to receive and capture the iris tissue. The ring 1 150 maintains the pupil in an extended position while the central opening 15 provides a wide viewing area during surgery. Fig. 2 shows an enlarged diagrammatic side view of ring of the type disclosed in Malyugin US Patent 8323296, showing iris tissue 16 within the wedge shaped gaps 13 and 14 of the loops The side 9 connects the bottom part of gap 13, which 155 is at one plane, to the top part of gap 14, which is at another plane. Fig. 3 shows an enlarged diagrammatic top plan of the modified ring of the type disclosed in Dusek US Patent Publication 2012/0269786. The Dusek ring 17 has four sides 18, 19, 20 and 21. Side 20 has the end butt joint 22 where a drop of adhesive secures the ends 23 and 24. Side 19 is perpendicular to side 20. The 160 sides are joined by a comer portion 25 which has three distinct bends, namely, a first obtuse bend 26 (essentially 135° inward and to the left as viewed in Fig. 3), second return bend 27 (essentially 180° inward and then down away from the viewer and then toward the right as viewed in Fig. 3), and a third obtuse bend 28 (essentially 135° up and to the left as viewed in Fig. 3). Comer portions 29, 30 165 and 31 are identical to comer portion 25. Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of the ring of the type disclosed in Christensen & Colvard US Patent Publication 2013/0096386. In the described embodiment of this disclosure, ring 32 has a square formation with rounded Comers 33, 34, 35 and 36. At each comer, there is a top plate 37, which forms generally one plane of 170 the ring and there is a bottom plate 38, which forms generally a second plane of the ring. These planes are generally above and below the primary plane of the ring formed by connecting limbs 39, 40, 41 and 42. Together, the outer periphery of the top plate and the bottom plate at each comer form a lip feature, which is the entrance of the pockets 43, 44, 45, and 46 that contain a portion of the iris, which 175 is supported in an open configuration. Fig. 5 shows an enlarged diagrammatic top view of the ring of the present invention used for enlargement and prevention of collapse of the pupil. The ring 47 is made of any resiliently flexible strand, for example, thermally treated 4-0 nylon suture. It is a continuous ring, has a square configuration and has four sides 180 48, 49, 50 and 51, joined by comer portions. Side 50 has ends 52 and 53 joined at the butt joint 54 with adhesi ve. Each one of the comer portions 55, 56, 57 and 58, forms a notch, same numerals representing the notches. Comer portion 56 joins side 49 to side 50, which are perpendicular to each other. At the comer portion 56, the strand loops inwards to form a notch. Three distinct bends of the strand in the 185 same plane form the notch. A first acute bend 59, second rounded return bend 60, and a third acute bend 61. The notch has a narrow outward opening 62, which allows iris tissue to enter the notch. Inwards, the notch has a blind, bulbous receptacle 63, which engages the pupillary margin and iris tissue gently. Comer portions 55, 57 and 58 are identical to comer portion 56 . Parts 64 and 65 of comer 190 portions 57 and 58 respectively, along with side 51, form an outward flange. Sides 48, 49 and 50, form similar flanges. The ring comprises alternate notches and flanges, all being in the same plane and enclosing a space 66. Fig. 6 shows an illustration of the pupil maintained in an enlarged position by the ring 47 of Fig. 5. The notches at comers 55, 56, 57 and 58, engage the pupillary 195 margin 67 at different parts and push them apart, causing enlargement of the pupil. The flanges at sides 48 and 50 remain in front of the Iris 68. The flanges at sides 49 and 51 remain behind the Iris and are not visible. The alternate notches and flanges cause bending of the pupillary margin and iris tissue somewhat like a paper clip This results in a secure yet reversible engagement. The central opening 200 66, allows wide view of the structures deeper to the pupillary plane. Fig. 7 shows an enlarged diagrammatic side view of the relation of iris tissue to the notches. This side view is at a vertical plane passing through the middle of any two adjacent notches of Fig. 6 The device distinctly bends the iris tissue 68, four times, as it passes through the two notches. From the left as viewed in Fig. 7, the 205 iris 68 passes above the side element 69 and outer limb 70 of the notch 71. The first bertd is at an obtuse angle as it passes downwards around the outer limb 70 of the notch 71 and through the notch. The second bend is at an obtuse angle to pass under the inner limb 72 of the notch 71. Iris 68 then makes a third bend at an obtuse angle as it passes upwards around the inner limb 73 of the notch 74 and 210 through the notch. The final fourth bend is at an obtuse angle to pass above the outer limb 75 of the notch 74 and side element 76. As viewed in Fig. 7, side element 69, outer limb 70 of the notch 71, the notch 71, inner limb 72 of the notch 71, inner limb 73 of the notch 74, the notch 74, Outer limb 75 of the notch 74 and side element 76, all lie in the same plane. 215 Fig. 8 refers to the usage of the invention, is an illustration of the insertion of the ring 47 of Fig. 5, into the eye and engagement of the pupillary margin 67 with the first notch 55 of the ring. A forceps (not shown here) carries the device or an injector (not shown here) delivers the device through the incision 77, into the anterior chamber of the eye. The flexible square ring 47 adopts a rhomboid 220 configuration as it negotiates through a much smaller incision 77. The notches 56 and 58 open up and temporarily straighten out as the device passes through the incision. The leading first notch 55 hooks and engages the pupillary margin 67 pushing it in an outward direction. The pupillary margin 67 is lifted with a Hirschman hook (not shown here) to tuck the flange 49 under the pupillary 225 margin 67 and iris 68 Fig. 9 refers to the usage of the invention in further detail, is an illustration of the stretched pupillary margin after engagement by the second notch 56 of the device 47 of Fig. 5. The resiliently flexible ring 47 has now returned to its square configuration. Notches 55 and 56 have engaged the pupillary margin 67 at two 230 different points and pushed them apart. Flange 49 (not visible here), remains tucked under the pupillary margin 67, while flanges 48, 50 and 51, remain in front of the iris 68 As the pupillary margin is hooked again with an iris or hirschman hook, introduced through a side port (not shown here), a forceps introduced through another side port (not shown here), holds the flange 51 and tucks it under 235 the pupillary margin 67 and iris 68. Fig. 10 refers to the usage of the invention in further detail, is an illustration of the pupillary margin 67, fully enlarged and adopting a square configuration after engagement by all four notches 55, 56, 57 and 58 of the device 47 of Fig. 5. The flanges 48 and 50 remain in front of the Iris 68. The flanges at sides 49 and 51 240 remain behind the iris and are not visible. The central opening 66, allows wide view of the structures deeper to the pupillary plane. On completion of surgery, the device is easily disengaged from the pupillary margin and pulled out with a forceps. The device exits the eye without snagging the incision because notches are in the same plane as the flanges and are capable of straightening temporarily. 245 Fig. 11 is an enlarged diagrammatic top view of another form of the device of the present invention, showing a discontinuous ring 78 with ends 79 and 80, which are blunt or olive shaped to prevent damage to delicate structures of the eye. The discontinuous ring 78 has five sides 81, 82, 83, 84 and 85, which are shaped like flanges. Comer portions joining these sides are internally obtuse angled. The four 250 comer portions 87, 88, 89 and 90, form four notches, same numerals representing the notches. Notch 86 is at the first end and notch 91 is at the second end of the ring. In the device of Fig. 11, the angles at comer 87 and 90 are equal to each other and the angles at comer 89 and 90 are equal to each other. The first side 81 and the fifth side 85 are parallel to each other, giving the device a flat top house 255 shape. The central space 92, is closed on five sides by the device, and open on one side. In another form of the device of Fig. 11 (not shown here), the first side 81 and the fifth side 85, are unparallel, such that the distance between the ends 79 and 80, is more than that between the first comer 87 and fourth comer 90, giving the device the shape of a flat top tower. 260 Fig. 12 is an illustration of the pUpil maintained in an enlarged position by the device of Fig. 11. The notches 86, 87, 88, 89, 90 and 91, engage the pupillary margin 67 at different parts and push them apart, causing enlargement of the pupil. Ends 79 and 80, and flanges 82 and 84 remain in front of the Iris 68. The flanges 81, 83 and 85 remain behind the Iris and are not visible. The constricting 265 force of the pupil draws the notches at the ends 79 and 80 of the discontinuous ring closer and the resultant shape of the central space 92 of the device and that of the pupil is a hexagon. The central space 92, allows wide view of the structures deeper to the pupillary plane. While the device of Fig. 11 may be inserted into the eye, in the manner described above for the device of Fig. 5, the device may 270 alternatively be inserted end first, into the eye, through a much smaller side port incision. The entire device is inserted into the anterior chamber and placed on the iris. The pupillary margin is hooked with an iris or hirschman hook, introduced through one side port incision, while a forceps introduced through another side port, holds flange 83 and tucks it under the pupillary margin 67. Similarly, flanges 275 81 and 85 are tucked under the pupillary margin. Fig. 13 is an enlarged diagrammatic top perspective of one form of the device of the present invention, showing alternate flanges of the device of Fig. 11, gently tilted backwards. Device 93 allows easier tucking of the flanges under the pupillary margin. Flanges 81, 83 and 85, shown in dotted lines, represent the 280 previous straight position of flanges. Flanges 94, 95 and 96 represent the backward tilted flanges, respectively. The flanges are tilted all the way up to the centre of the notch or only at the peripheral edge. The position of flanges 82 and 84, which remain in front of the pupillary margin, is unaltered. Although tilted flanges are shown on the device of the present invention of Fig. 11, it is 285 understood that such flanges may be present on all the forms of the device. Fig. 14 is an enlarged diagrammatic top view of one form of the device of the present invention, showing plurality of positioning holes on a hexagon shaped continuous ring with no joint. Holes 98 and 99 are shown on a flange and notch respectively on the device 97. These holes are partial thickness or full thickness. 290 These holes allow easy manipulation of the device inside the eye with the help of a pointed instrument called dialler. Although positioning holes or eyelets are shown on the device of the present invention of Fig 14, it is understood that such positioning holes or eyelets may be present on all the forms of the device. Fig. 15 is an enlarged diagrammatic top view of one form of the device of the 295 present invention, showing engagement of the pupillary margin 67 by notches formed by an inward loop of the strand between two outward digit shaped protruding loops of the strand of a square shaped continuous ring with no joint. The ring 100 has four side elements 101, 102, 103 and 104. Corner portions 105, 106,107 and 108, join the side elements. Comer portion 108 joins side 101 to side 300 104, which are perpendicular to each other. At the comer portion 108, the strand makes three distinct loops in the same plane to form a notch. Loops 115 and 116 are outward digit like protrusions. Notch 117, is formed by an inward loop between these two outward looped protrusions. Comer portions 105, 106 and 107 are identical to comer portion 108 and form notches 118, 119 and 120 305 respectively. The pupillary margin 67 has a square configuration as it is engaged by the notches 117, 118, 119 and 120, as it passes behind the elements 110, 111, 114 and 115, and in front of elements 112, 113, 116 and 109. The enclosed space 121, allows wide view of the structures deeper to the pupillary plane. Fig. 16 is an enlarged diagrammatic top view of one form of the device of the 310 present invention, showing engagement of the pupillary margin 67 by two adjacent notches at the comers of a square shaped continuous ring with no joint. The ring 122 has four side elements 123, 124, 125 and 126. Comer portions 127, 128, 129 and 130, join the side elements. Comer portion 127 joins side 123 to side 124, which are perpendicular to each other. At the comer portion 127, the strand 315 makes three distinct loops in the same plane to form two adjacent paired notches or a double notch. Paired notches 131 and 132 are formed by two loops directed inwards. A digit like structure 139, is formed between these two notches by a loop directed outwards. Comer portions 128, 129 and 130, are identical to comer portion 127 and form paired notches 133, 134 and 135, 136 and 137, 138 320 respectively. The pupillary margin 67 has a square configuration, engaged by the notches 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137 and 138. The pupillary margin 67 passes behind side elements 123, 124, 125 and 126, and in front of elements 139, 140, 141 and 142. The enclosed space 143, allows wide view of the structures deeper to the pupillary plane. The pupillary margin 67 could alternately pass (not 325 shown here) in front of side elements 123,124,125 and 126, and behind elements 139,140, 141 and 142 Those ordinarily skilled in the art can make changes in the embodiments described and illustrated, without altering the concepts of the present invention.
