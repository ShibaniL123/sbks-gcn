CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/719,117, filed Oct. 26, 2012, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prostate cancer is the ninth-most-common cancer in the world, but is the number-one non-skin cancer in men from the United States. As of 2011, prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in males worldwide. In 2008, there were 186,000 new diagnoses and 28,600 deaths attributable to prostate cancer. In India in the 1990s, half of the people with prostate cancer confined to the prostate died within ten years. The continuing and highly prevalent problem of prostate cancer highlights the overwhelming need for new drugs to treat this condition and its underlying causes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that compounds of this invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, are effective as modulators of androgen receptors (ARs). Such compounds have the general formula I: or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein each variable is as defined and described herein. Compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, are useful in medicine, and particularly for treating any of a variety of diseases, disorders or conditions. For example, provided compounds are useful in treatment of diseases, disorders or conditions associated with ARs, and particularly with diseases, disorders or conditions associated with androgen-resistant ARs or an AR mutant associated with “castration-resistant” prostate cancer. Such diseases, disorders, or conditions include those described herein. Compounds provided by this invention are also useful for the study of androgen receptors in biological and pathological phenomena; the study of intracellular signal transduction pathways occurring in reproductive and other bodily tissues; and the comparative evaluation of new AR modulators or treatments for AR-related diseases in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, by virtue of their interaction with ARs the compounds of the present invention are useful as targeting moieties for the delivery of payloads targeting cancer cells expressing wild type or mutant androgen-resistant ARs or AR mutants associated with “castration-resistant” prostate cancer. Such uses as targeting agents for the delivery of payloads include those described herein.

As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75th Ed. Additionally, general principles of organic chemistry are described in “Organic Chemistry”, Thomas Sorrell, University Science Books, Sausalito: 1999, and “March's Advanced Organic Chemistry”, 5th Ed., Ed.: Smith, M. B. and March, J., John Wiley & Sons, New York: 2001, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The phrase “spiro fused at point Z”, as used herein, means that when Z is Ring B, said Ring B is spiro-fused to the thiohydantoin ring of formula I in such a manner that both rings share a common tetrasubstituted carbon atom denoted Z in formula I. By way of a non-limiting example, in some embodiments when Ring B is a cyclopentane ring, compounds of formula I have the general formula: Furthermore, as a means for denoting the point of spiro fusion in the embodiments herein, specific examples of Ring B shall be understood to be fused to the thiohydantoin ring at the carbon atom denoted Z. Thus, as a non-limiting example, when it is desired to communicate that Ring B is a 4,4-dimethylcyclohexane ring fused to the thiohydantoin ring through position 1 of the cyclohexane ring, such a ring can be depicted in the following manner: Alternatively, the point of attachment on each of the spiro-fused rings can be denoted by asterisks in the following manner: The term “aliphatic” or “aliphatic group”, as used herein, means a straight-chain (i.e., unbranched) or branched, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon chain that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, or a monocyclic hydrocarbon or bicyclic hydrocarbon that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic (also referred to herein as “carbocycle,” “cycloaliphatic” or “cycloalkyl”), that has a single point of attachment to the rest of the molecule. Unless otherwise specified, aliphatic groups contain 1-6 aliphatic carbon atoms. In some embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-5 aliphatic carbon atoms. In other embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-4 aliphatic carbon atoms.

Suitable aliphatic groups include, but are not limited to, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl groups and hybrids thereof such as (cycloalkyl)alkyl, (cycloalkenyl)alkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkenyl. The term “lower alkyl” refers to a C1-4 straight or branched alkyl group. Exemplary lower alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, and tert-butyl. The term “lower haloalkyl” refers to a C1-4 straight or branched alkyl group that is substituted with one or more halogen atoms. As used herein, the term “androgen” is used herein to refer to agents androgenic activity. Androgenic activity may be determined or characterized in any of a variety of ways, including in any of a variety of biological activity assays (e.g., in vitro or in vivo assays, for example utilizing animals and/or animal tissues) in which the agent is observed to have one or more activities similar or comparable to that of a known androgen assessed under comparable conditions (whether simultaneously or otherwise). In some embodiments, androgenic activity is or comprises transcriptional regulation (e.g., activation) of an androgen-responsive target gene. In some embodiments, androgenic activity is or comprises stimulation of prostate growth in rodents. Exemplary know androgens include, for example, androstanedione, androstenediol, androstenedione, androsterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and testosterone. As used herein, the term “antiandrogen” refers to any agent that inhibits biological activity of androgens. In some embodiments, antiandrogens inhibit biological activity of an AR. In some embodiments antiandrogens inhibit biological activity of a wild type AR. In some embodiments, antiandrogens inhibit biological activity of one or more AR included in Table A.

As used herein, the term “associated with” means correlated with or statistically likely to occur or appear together with another state, or condition. In some embodiments, the term “associated with” refers to statistically non-random or correlated events. In some embodiments, the term “associated with” refers to a physical association in three-dimensional space. In some such embodiments, such physical association is mediated by one or more covalent or non-covalent (e.g., hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals interactions, electrostatic forces, magnetic forces, pi-pi interactions, sigma-pi interactions, etc.). As used herein, the terms “correlates” or “correlated”, as used herein, has its ordinary meaning of “showing a correlation with”. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that two features, items or values show a correlation with one another if they show a tendency to appear and/or to vary, together. In some embodiments, a correlation is statistically significant when its p-value is less than 0.05; in some embodiments, a correlation is statistically significant when its p-value is less than 0.01. In some embodiments, correlation is assessed by regression analysis. In some embodiments, a correlation is a correlation coefficient. As used herein, the term “corresponding to” is often used to designate the position/identity of a particular residue within a polymeric agent (e.g., within a nucleic acid or polypeptide). Those of ordinary skill will appreciate that, for purposes of simplicity, a canonical numbering system (based on a reference polymer) is often utilized herein in order to facilitate comparison of polymer sequences. Those of ordinary skill in the art understand how to align polymer sequences in order to determine which residues “correspond” to particular positions in a reference polymer. For example, those skilled in the art appreciate that a particular residue in a polypeptide of interest may “correspond to” a residue at a certain position in a reference polypeptide even if it is not found at the same position (relative to a terminus of the polypeptide) in the polypeptide of interest, so long as its context in the polypeptide of interest is sufficiently similar to that of the residue in the polypeptide of interest that it would be recognized by one skilled in the art as “corresponding to” that reference residue. As used herein, a “detection moiety” in the context of provided multifunctional agents refers to a molecular structure or module that allows visualization/imaging, measurements (localization, quantification, etc.) and/or monitoring of an agent in vitro and/or in vivo using one or more detection techniques including but not limited to spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical, chemical or other means. The term “heteroatom” means one or more of oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, or silicon (including, any oxidized form of nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or silicon; the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen or; a substitutable nitrogen of a heterocyclic ring, for example N (as in 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrolyl), NH (as in pyrrolidinyl) or NR+ (as in N-substituted pyrrolidinyl)). As used herein, the terms “improve,” “increase” or “reduce,” or grammatical equivalents, indicate a change in a value relative to a comparable baseline or reference measurement. In some embodiments, a comparable baseline or reference measurement is a measurement taken in the same system (e.g., of the same individual) prior to initiation of an event of interest (e.g., of therapy). In some embodiments, a comparable baseline or reference measurement is one taken in a different system (e.g., a different individual or cell) under otherwise identical conditions (e.g., in a normal cell or individual as compared with one suffering from or susceptible to a particular disease, disorder or condition, for example due to presence of a particular genetic mutation). As used herein, the term “in vitro” refers to events that occur in an artificial environment, e.g., in a test tube or reaction vessel, in cell culture, etc., rather than within a multi-cellular organism. As used herein, the term “in vivo” refers to events that occur within a multi-cellular organism, such as a human and a non-human animal. In the context of cell-based systems, the term may be used to refer to events that occur within a living cell (as opposed to, for example, in vitro systems). As used herein, the term “mutant” refers to an altered (as compared with a reference) nucleic acid or polypeptide, or to a cell or organism containing or expressing such an altered nucleic acid or polypeptide. The term “polypeptide” or “peptide”, as used herein, generally has its art-recognized meaning of a polymer of at least three amino acids. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the term “polypeptide” is intended to be sufficiently general as to encompass not only polypeptides having the a complete sequence recited herein, but also to encompass polypeptides that represent functional fragments (i.e., fragments retaining at least one activity) of such complete polypeptides. Moreover, those of ordinary skill in the art understand that protein sequences generally tolerate some substitution without destroying activity. Thus, any polypeptide that retains activity and shares at least about 30-40% overall sequence identity, often greater than about 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80%, and further usually including at least one region of much higher identity, often greater than 90% or even 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% in one or more highly conserved regions, usually encompassing at least 3-4 and often up to 20 or more amino acids, with another polypeptide of the same class, is encompassed within the relevant term “polypeptide” as used herein. The term “protein” as used herein refers to one or more polypeptides that function as a discrete unit. If a single polypeptide is the discrete functioning unit and does not require permanent or temporary physical association with other polypeptides in order to form the discrete functioning unit, the terms “polypeptide” and “protein” may be used interchangeably. If the discrete functional unit is comprised of more than one polypeptide that physically associate with one another, the term “protein” may be used to refers to the multiple polypeptides that are physically associated coupled and function together as the discrete unit. As will be understood from context, a reference sequence, sample, population, agent or individual is one that is sufficiently similar to a particular sequence, sample, population, agent or individual of interest to permit a relevant comparison (i.e., to be comparable). In some embodiments, information about a reference sample is obtained simultaneously with information about a particular sample. In some embodiments, information about a reference sample is historical. In some embodiments, information about a reference sample is stored for example in a computer-readable medium. In some embodiments, comparison of a particular sample of interest with a reference sample establishes identity with, similarity to, or difference of a particular sample of interest relative to a reference. As used herein, the term “sample” typically refers to a biological sample obtained or derived from a source of interest, as described herein. In some embodiments, a source of interest comprises an organism, such as an animal or human. In some embodiments, a biological sample is or comprises biological tissue or fluid. In some embodiments, a biological sample may be or comprise bone marrow; blood; blood cells; ascites; tissue or fine needle biopsy samples; cell-containing body fluids; free floating nucleic acids; sputum; saliva; urine; cerebrospinal fluid, peritoneal fluid; pleural fluid; feces; lymph; gynecological fluids; skin swabs; vaginal swabs; oral swabs; nasal swabs; washings or lavages such as a ductal lavages or broncheoalveolar lavages; aspirates; scrapings; bone marrow specimens; tissue biopsy specimens; surgical specimens; feces, other body fluids, secretions, and/or excretions; and/or cells therefrom, etc. In some embodiments, a biological sample is or comprises cells obtained from an individual. In some embodiments, obtained cells are or include cells from an individual from whom the sample is obtained. In some embodiments, a sample is a “primary sample” obtained directly from a source of interest by any appropriate means. For example, in some embodiments, a primary biological sample is obtained by methods selected from the group consisting of biopsy (e.g., fine needle aspiration or tissue biopsy), surgery, collection of body fluid (e.g., blood, lymph, feces etc.), etc. In some embodiments, as will be clear from context, the term “sample” refers to a preparation that is obtained by processing (e.g., by removing one or more components of and/or by adding one or more agents to) a primary sample. For example, filtering using a semi-permeable membrane. Such a “processed sample” may comprise, for example nucleic acids or proteins extracted from a sample or obtained by subjecting a primary sample to techniques such as amplification or reverse transcription of mRNA, isolation and/or purification of certain components, etc. As used herein, a “targeting moiety” in the context of provided multifunctional agents refers to a molecular structure or module that affects or controls the site of action by specifically interacting with, or has affinity for, a target of interest. In some embodiments, a targeting moiety useful for the present invention is a compound of formula I. As used herein, a “therapeutic moiety” in the context of provided multifunctional agents refers to a molecular structure or module that confers a therapeutic effect. In some embodiments, therapeutic effects conferred by a therapeutic moiety of a multifunctional agent of the present invention include anti-cancer effects. Accordingly, a therapeutic moiety may be an anti-cancer agent (e.g., chemotherapeutic agent). In some embodiments, anti-cancer agents useful for the present invention are agents that inhibit tumor growth, agents that inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, agents that preferentially kill cancer cells, agents that inhibit angiogenesis, etc. In some embodiments, such agents are small molecules. Small molecules include, without limitation, small chemical-based entities, such as chemotoxins and cytostatic drugs, which may be referred to as “SCEs.” Typically, SCEs are non-peptide, non-nucleic acid molecules. In those embodiments that include both a therapeutic entity and a diagnostic entity, the therapeutic entity and the target entity are not the same entity. As used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of an agent which confers a therapeutic effect on a treated subject, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. A therapeutic effect may be objective (i.e., measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (i.e., subject gives an indication of or feels an effect). In particular, a “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of a therapeutic agent effective to treat, ameliorate, or prevent a desired disease or condition, or to exhibit a detectable therapeutic or preventative effect, such as by ameliorating symptoms associated with a disease, preventing or delaying onset of a disease, and/or also lessening severity or frequency of symptoms of a disease. A therapeutically effective amount is commonly administered in a dosing regimen that may comprise multiple unit doses. For any particular therapeutic agent, a therapeutically effective amount (and/or an appropriate unit dose within an effective dosing regimen) may vary, for example, depending on route of administration, on combination with other agents. Also, a specific therapeutically effective amount (and/or unit dose) for any particular patient may depend upon a variety of factors including what disorder is being treated; disorder severity; activity of specific agents employed; specific composition employed; age, body weight, general health, and diet of a patient; time of administration, route of administration; treatment duration; and like factors as is well known in the medical arts. As used herein, the term “treat,” “treatment,” or “treating” refers to any method used to partially or completely alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset of, reduce severity of and/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a particular disease, disorder, and/or condition. Treatment may be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease and/or exhibits only early signs of the disease for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing pathology associated with the disease. The term “unsaturated,” as used herein, means that a moiety has one or more units of unsaturation. As used herein, the term “wild-type” refers to a typical or common form existing in nature; in some embodiments it is the most common form.

As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge et al., describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that some structures provided herein represent compounds that can exist in a plurality of isomeric (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational)) forms; for example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, Z and E double bond isomers, and Z and E conformational isomers. Single such isomers or forms (e.g. stereochemical isomers [e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, etc.] and/or geometric (or conformational) isomers), as well as combinations or mixtures of such forms are within the scope of the invention. Similarly, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention. Additionally, those skilled in the art will appreciate that analogs of compounds having depicted structures that vary from the depicted compound only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms may readily be prepared; such “isotopic isomers” of provided compounds are also within the scope of the present invention, and may be provided individually or together with one or more other forms of the compound. For example, compounds having depicted structures wherein one or more hydrogen atoms has/have been replaced by deuterium and/or tritium, one or more carbon atoms has/have been replaced by a 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. Such isotopic isomers are useful, for example, as analytical tools, as probes in biological assays, or as therapeutic agents in accordance with the present invention. 3. Description of Exemplary Embodiments Androgen Receptor The androgen receptor (AR), located on Xql 1-12, is a 110 kD nuclear receptor that, upon activation by androgens, mediates transcription of target genes that modulate growth and differentiation of prostate epithelial cells. Similar to other steroid receptors, unbound AR is mainly located in cytoplasm and associated with a complex of heat shock proteins (HSPs) through interactions with its ligand-binding domain. Upon agonist binding, AR undergoes a series of conformational changes: heat shock proteins dissociate from AR, and transformed AR undergoes dimerization, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation, which is mediated by its nuclear localization signal. Translocated receptors then binds to androgen response elements (ARE), which are characterized by a six-nucleotide half-site consensus sequence 5′-TGTTCT-3′ spaced by three random nucleotides and are located in promoter or enhancer regions of AR gene targets. Recruitment of other transcription co-regulators (including co-activators and co-repressors) and transcriptional machinery further ensures transactivation of AR-regulated gene expression. All of these processes are initiated by the ligand-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain. As used herein, “Androgen-dependent disorder” refers to any disorder that can benefit from a decrease in androgen stimulation and includes pathological conditions that depend on androgen stimulation. An “androgen-dependent disorder” can result from an excessive accumulation of testosterone or other androgenic hormone, increased sensitivity of androgen receptors to androgen, or an increase in androgen-stimulated transcription. Examples of “androgen-dependent disorders” include prostate cancer and skin disorders such as, for example, acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, alopecia, or hidradenitis suppurativa. Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the US, and approximately one in every six American men will be diagnosed with the disease during his lifetime. Treatment aimed at eradicating the tumor is unsuccessful in 30% of men, who develop recurrent disease that is usually manifest first as a rise in plasma prostate-specific antigen (PSA) followed by spread to distant sites. AR signaling is crucial for development and maintenance of male reproductive organs including prostate glands, as genetic males harboring loss of function AR mutations and mice engineered with AR defects do not develop prostates or prostate cancer. This dependence of prostate cells on AR signaling continues even upon neoplastic transformation. Given that prostate cancer cells depend on AR for their proliferation and survival, these men are treated with agents that block production of testosterone (e.g. GnRH agonists), alone or in combination with antiandrogens, which antagonize effects of any residual testosterone. This approach is effective as evidenced by a drop in PSA and regression of any visible tumor. Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer This hormone-refractory state to which most patients eventually progresses in the presence of continued androgen ablation or anti-androgen therapy is known as “castration resistant” prostate cancer (CRPC). Compelling data demonstrate that AR is expressed in most prostate cancer cells and overexpression of AR is necessary and sufficient for androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. Failure in hormonal therapy, resulting from development of androgen-independent growth, is an obstacle for successful management of advanced prostate cancer. Instances of antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome have also been reported after prolonged treatment with antiandrogens. Antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome is commonly observed clinically and is defined in terms of tumor regression or symptomatic relief observed upon cessation of antiandrogen therapy. AR mutations that result in receptor promiscuity and the ability of these antiandrogens to exhibit agonist activity might at least partially account for this phenomenon. For example, hydroxyflutamide and bicalutamide act as AR agonists in T8787A, W741L and W741C AR mutants, respectively. Treatment options for CPRC are an unmet need. Until recently, docetaxel was the only agent shown to prolong survival. More recently, four newer treatments have come onto the market, including sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapeutic agent; cabazitaxel, a novel microtubule inhibitor; abiraterone acetate, a new androgen biosynthesis inhibitor; and denosumab. Interestingly, while a small minority of CRPC does bypass the requirement for AR signaling, the vast majority of CRPC, though frequently termed “androgen independent prostate cancer” or “hormone refractory prostate cancer,” retains its lineage dependence on AR signaling. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides modulators, agonists, and antagonists of AR. In some such embodiments, the AR is an androgen-resistant AR or an AR mutant associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In some embodiments, the AR has an amino acid sequence as set forth in Table A.

The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. In some embodiments, provided compositions are administered orally, intraperitoneally or intravenously. Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. Such suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the invention may be formulated as injectable preparations. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. In some embodiments, injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In some embodiments, for example in order to prolong effects of a compound or composition, it may be desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively or additionally, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. In some embodiments, sterile injectable preparations may be or include a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. Such oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.

In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof, are administered in combination with antisense agents, a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody or an siRNA therapeutic. Those additional agents may be administered separately from an inventive compound-containing composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively or in addition to those additional agents administered separately, those agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with a compound of this invention in a single composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regime, the two active agents may be submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another, normally within five hours from one another. As used herein, the term “combination,” “combined,” and related terms refers to the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with this invention. For example, a compound of the present invention may be administered with another therapeutic agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single unit dosage form. Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form comprising a compound of formula I, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. The amount of both, an inventive compound and additional therapeutic agent (in those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above) that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably, compositions of this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01-100 mg/kg body weight/day of an inventive can be administered. In those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent, that additional therapeutic agent and the compound of this invention may act synergistically. Therefore, the amount of additional therapeutic agent in such compositions will be less than that required in a monotherapy utilizing only that therapeutic agent. In such compositions a dosage of between 0.01-100 μg/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be administered. The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent.

In some embodiments, the nucleic acid agent comprises a promoter and/or other sequences that regulate transcription. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid agent comprises an origin of replication and/or other sequences that regulate replication. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid agent does not include a promoter and/or an origin of replication. Nucleic acid anti-cancer agents suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include those agents that target genes associated with tumorigenesis and cell growth or cell transformation (e.g., proto-oncogenes, which code for proteins that stimulate cell division), angiogenic/anti-angiogenic genes, tumor suppressor genes (which code for proteins that suppress cell division), genes encoding proteins associated with tumor growth and/or tumor migration, and suicide genes (which induce apoptosis or other forms of cell death), especially suicide genes that are most active in rapidly dividing cells. Examples of genes associated with tumorigenesis and/or cell transformation include MLL fusion genes, BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1, EWS-FLI1, TLS-FUS, PAX3-FKHR, Bcl-2, AML1-ETO, AML1-MTG8, Ras, Fos PDGF, RET, APC, NF-1, Rb, p53, MDM2 and the like; overexpressed genes such as multidrug resistance genes; cyclins; beta-Catenin; telomerase genes; c-myc, n-myc, Bcl-2, Erb-B1 and Erb-B2; and mutated genes such as Ras, Mos, Raf, and Met. Examples of tumor suppressor genes include, but are not limited to, p53, p21, RB1, WT1, NF1, VHL, APC, DAP kinase, p16, ARF, Neurofibromin, and PTEN. Examples of genes that can be targeted by nucleic acid agents useful in anti-cancer therapy include genes encoding proteins associated with tumor migration such as integrins, selectins, and metalloproteinases; anti-angiogenic genes encoding proteins that promote formation of new vessels such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) or VEGFr; anti-angiogenic genes encoding proteins that inhibit neovascularization such as endostatin, angiostatin, and VEGF-R2; and genes encoding proteins such as interleukins, interferon, fibroblast growth factor (α-FGF and (β-FGF), insulin-like growth factor (e.g., IGF-1 and IGF-2), Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Transforming Growth Factor (e.g., TGF-α and TGF-β, Epidermal growth factor (EGF), Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF), stem cell factor and its receptor c-Kit (SCF/c-Kit) ligand, CD40L/CD40, VLA-4 VCAM-1, ICAM-1/LFA-1, hyalurin/CD44, and the like. As will be recognized by one skilled in the art, the foregoing examples are not exclusive. Nucleic acid agents suitable for use in the invention may have any of a variety of uses including, for example, use as anti-cancer or other therapeutic agents, probes, primers, etc. Nucleic acid agents may have enzymatic activity (e.g., ribozyme activity), gene expression inhibitory activity (e.g., as antisense or siRNA agents, etc), and/or other activities. Nucleic acids agents may be active themselves or may be vectors that deliver active nucleic acid agents (e.g., through replication and/or transcription of a delivered nucleic acid). For purposes of the present specification, such vector nucleic acids are considered “therapeutic agents” if they encode or otherwise deliver a therapeutically active agent, even if they do not themselves have therapeutic activity. In certain embodiments, conjugates comprise a nucleic acid therapeutic agent that comprises or encodes an antisense compound. The terms “antisense compound or agent,” “antisense oligomer,” “antisense oligonucleotide,” and “antisense oligonucleotide analog” are used herein interchangeably, and refer to a sequence of nucleotide bases and a subunit-to-subunit backbone that allows the antisense compound to hybridize to a target sequence in an RNA by Watson-Crick base pairing to form an RNA oligomer heteroduplex within the target sequence. The oligomer may have exact sequence complementarity within the target sequence or near complementarity. Such antisense oligomers may block or inhibit translation of the mRNA containing the target sequence, or inhibit gene transcription. Antisense oligomers may bind to double-stranded or single-stranded sequences. Examples of antisense oligonucleotides suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include, for example, those mentioned in the following reviews: R. A Stahel et al., Lung Cancer, 2003, 41: S81-S88; K. F. Pirollo et al., Pharmacol. Ther., 2003, 99: 55-77; A. C. Stephens and R. P. Rivers, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther., 2003, 5: 118-122; N. M. Dean and C.

Biotechnol., 2006, 33: 221-238 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Examples of suitable antisense oligonucleotides include, for example oblimersen sodium (also known as Genasense™ or G31239, developed by Genta, Inc., Berkeley Heights, N.J.), a phosphorothioate oligomer targeted towards the initiation codon region of the bcl-2 mRNA. Bcl-2 is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis and is overexpressed in many cancer including follicular lymphomas, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and intermediate/high-grade lymphomas (C. A. Stein et al., Semin. Oncol., 2005, 32: 563-573; S. R. Frankel, Semin. Oncol., 2003, 30: 300-304). Other suitable antisense oligonucleotides include GEM-231 (HYB0165, Hybridon, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.), which is a mixed backbone oligonucleotide directed against cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (S. Goel et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 203, 9: 4069-4076); Affinitak (ISIS 3521 or aprinocarsen, ISIS pharmaceuticals, Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.), an antisense inhibitor of PKCalpha; OGX-011 (Isis 112989, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a 2′-methoxyethyl modified antisense oligonucleotide against clusterin, a glycoprotein implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, tissue remodeling, lipid transport, and cell death and which is overexpressed in cancers of breast, prostate and colon; ISIS 5132 (Isis 112989, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to a sequence of the 3′-unstranslated region of the c-raf-1 mRNA (S. P. Henry et al., Anticancer Drug Des., 1997, 12: 409-420; B. P. Monia et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1996, 93: 15481-15484; C. M. Rudin et al., Clin.

Toronto, Canada), a 20-mer oligonucleotide that is complementary to a coding region in the mRNA of the R2 small subunit component of human ribonucleotide reductase. Other suitable antisense oligonucleotides include antisense oligonucleotides that are being developed against Her-2/neu, c-Myb, c-Myc, and c-Raf (see, for example, A. Biroccio et al., Oncogene, 2003, 22: 6579-6588; Y. Lee et al., Cancer Res., 2003, 63: 2802-2811; B. Lu et al., Cancer Res., 2004, 64: 2840-2845; K. F. Pirollo et al., Pharmacol. Ther., 2003, 99: 55-77; and A. Rait et al., Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., 2003, 1002: 78-89). In certain embodiments, conjugates of the present invention comprise a nucleic acid anti-cancer agent that comprises or encodes an interfering RNA molecule. The terms “interfering RNA” and “interfering RNA molecule” are used herein interchangeably, and refer to an RNA molecule that can inhibit or downregulate gene expression or silence a gene in a sequence-specific manner, for example by mediating RNA interference (RNAi). RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved, sequence-specific mechanism triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that induces degradation of complementary target single-stranded mRNA and “silencing” of the corresponding translated sequences (McManus and Sharp, 2002, Nature Rev. Genet., 2002, 3: 737). RNAi functions by enzymatic cleavage of longer dsRNA strands into biologically active “short-interfering RNA” (siRNA) sequences of about 21-23 nucleotides in length (Elbashir et al., Genes Dev., 2001, 15: 188). RNA interference has emerged as a promising approach for therapy of cancer. An interfering RNA suitable for use in the practice of the present invention can be provided in any of several forms. For example, an interfering RNA can be provided as one or more of an isolated short interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), or short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Examples of interfering RNA molecules suitable for use in the present invention include, for example, the iRNAs cited in the following reviews: O. Milhavet et al., Pharmacol. Rev., 2003, 55: 629-648; F. Bi et al., Curr. Gene. Ther., 2003, 3: 411-417; P. Y. Lu et al., Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther., 2003, 5: 225-234; I. Friedrich et al., Semin. Cancer Biol., 2004, 14: 223-230; M. Izquierdo, Cancer Gene Ther., 2005, 12: 217-227; P. Y. Lu et al., Adv. Genet., 2005, 54: 117-142; G. R. Devi, Cancer Gene Ther., 2006, 13: 819-829; M. A. Behlke, Mol. Ther., 2006, 13: 644-670; and L. N. Putral et al., Drug News Perspect., 2006, 19: 317-324 (the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Other examples of suitable interfering RNA molecules include, but are not limited to, p53 interfering RNAs (e.g., T. R. Brummelkamp et al., Science, 2002, 296: 550-553; M. T. Hemman et al., Nat. Genet., 2003, 33: 396-400); interfering RNAs that target the bcr-abl fusion, which is associated with development of chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (e.g., M. Scherr et al., Blood, 2003, 101: 1566-1569; M. J. Li et al., Oligonucleotides, 2003, 13: 401-409), interfering RNAs that inhibit expression of NPM-ALK, a protein that is found in 75% of anaplastic large cell lymphomas and leads to expression of a constitutively active kinase associated with tumor formation (U. Ritter et al., Oligonucleotides, 2003, 13: 365-373); interfering RNAs that target oncogenes, such as Raf-1 (T. F. Lou et al., Oligonucleotides, 2003, 13: 313-324), K-Ras (T. R. Brummelkamp et al., Cancer Cell, 2002, 2: 243-247), erbB-2 (G. Yang et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2004, 279: 4339-4345); interfering RNAs that target b-catenin protein, whose over-expression leads to transactivation of the T-cell factor target genes, which is thought to be the main transforming event in colorectal cancer (M. van de Wetering et al., EMBO Rep., 2003, 4: 609-615). In certain embodiments, conjugates of the present invention comprise a nucleic acid therapeutic agent that is a ribozyme. As used herein, the term “ribozyme” refers to a catalytic RNA molecule that can cleave other RNA molecules in a target-specific marmer Ribozymes can be used to downregulate the expression of any undesirable products of genes of interest. Examples of ribozymes that can be used in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, ANGIOZYME™ (RPI.4610, Sima Therapeutics, Boulder, Colo.), a ribozyme targeting the conserved region of human, mouse, and rat vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 mRNA, and Herzyme (Sima Therapeutics). In certain embodiments, entities or moieties within conjugates of the invention comprise a photosensitizer used in photodynamic therapy (PDT). In PDT, local or systemic administration of a photosensitizer to a patient is followed by irradiation with light that is absorbed by the photosensitizer in the tissue or organ to be treated. Light absorption by the photosensitizer generates reactive species (e.g., radicals) that are detrimental to cells. For maximal efficacy, a photosensitizer typically is in a form suitable for administration, and also in a form that can readily undergo cellular internalization at the target site, often with some degree of selectivity over normal tissues. While some photosensitizers (e.g., Photofrin®, QLT, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) have been delivered successfully as part of a simple aqueous solution, such aqueous solutions may not be suitable for hydrophobic photosensitizer drugs, such as those that have a tetra- or poly-pyrrole-based structure. These drugs have an inherent tendency to aggregate by molecular stacking, which results in a significant reduction in the efficacy of the photosensitization processes (Siggel et al., J. Phys. Chem., 1996, 100: 2070-2075). Approaches to minimize aggregation include liposomal formulations (e.g., for benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid A, BPDMA, Verteporfin®, QLT, Inc., Vancouver, Canada; and zinc phthalocyanine, CIBA-Geigy, Ltd., Basel, Switzerland), and conjugation of photosensitizers to biocompatible block copolymers (Peterson et al., Cancer Res., 1996, 56: 3980-3985) and/or antibodies (Omelyanenko et al., Int. J. Cancer, 1998, 75: 600-608). Conjugates of the invention comprising a compound of the invention associated with a photosensitizer can be used as new delivery systems in PDT. In addition to reducing photosensitizer aggregation, delivery of photosensitizers according to the present invention exhibits other advantages such as increased specificity for target tissues/organ and cellular internalization of the photosensitizer. Photosensitizers suitable for use in the present invention include any of a variety of synthetic and naturally occurring molecules that have photosensitizing properties useful in PDT. In certain embodiments, the absorption spectrum of the photosensitizer is in the visible range, typically between 350 nm and 1200 nm, preferably between 400 nm and 900 nm, e.g., between 600 nm and 900 nm. Suitable photosensitizers that can be coupled to toxins according to the present invention include, but are not limited to, porphyrins and porphyrin derivatives (e.g., chlorins, bacteriochlorins, isobacteriochlorins, phthalocyanines, and naphthalocyanines); metalloporphyrins, metallophthalocyanines, angelicins, chalcogenapyrrillium dyes, chlorophylls, coumarins, flavins and related compounds such as alloxazine and riboflavin, fullerenes, pheophorbides, pyropheophorbides, cyanines (e.g., merocyanine 540), pheophytins, sapphyrins, texaphyrins, purpurins, porphycenes, phenothiaziniums, methylene blue derivatives, naphthalimides, nile blue derivatives, quinones, perylenequinones (e.g., hypericins, hypocrellins, and cercosporins), psoralens, quinones, retinoids, rhodamines, thiophenes, verdins, xanthene dyes (e.g., eosins, erythrosins, rose bengals), dimeric and oligomeric forms of porphyrins, and prodrugs such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (R. W. Redmond and J. N. Gamlin, Photochem. Photobiol., 1999, 70: 391-475). Exemplary photosensitizers suitable for use in the present invention include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,171,741; 5,171,749; 5,173,504; 5,308,608; 5,405,957; 5,512,675; 5,726,304; 5,831,088; 5,929,105; and 5,880,145 (the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). In certain embodiments, conjugates of the invention comprise a radiosensitizer. As used herein, the term “radiosensitizer” refers to a molecule, compound or agent that makes tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Administration of a radiosensitizer to a patient receiving radiation therapy generally results in enhancement of the effects of radiation therapy. Ideally, a radiosensitizer exerts its function only on target cells. For ease of use, a radiosensitizer should also be able to find target cells even if it is administered systemically. However, currently available radiosensitizers are typically not selective for tumors, and they are distributed by diffusion in a mammalian body. Conjugates of the present invention can be used as a new delivery system for radiosensitizers. A variety of radiosensitizers are known in the art. Examples of radiosensitizers suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, paclitaxel (TAXOL), carboplatin, cisplatin, and oxaliplatin (Amorino et al., Radiat. Oncol. Investig. 1999; 7: 343-352; Choy, Oncology, 1999, 13: 22-38; Safran et al., Cancer Invest., 2001, 19: 1-7; Dionet et al., Anticancer Res., 2002, 22: 721-725; Cividalli et al., Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys., 2002, 52: 1092-1098); gemcitabine (Gemzar®) (Choy, Oncology, 2000, 14: 7-14; Mornex and Girard, Annals of Oncology, 2006, 17: 1743-1747); etanidazole (Nitrolmidazole®) (Inanami et al., Int. J. Radiat. Biol., 2002, 78: 267-274); misonidazole (Tamulevicius et al., Br. J. Radiology, 1981, 54: 318-324; Palcic et al., Radiat. Res., 1984, 100: 340-347), tirapazamine (Masunaga et al., Br. J. Radiol., 2006, 79: 991-998; Rischin et al., J. Clin. Oncol., 2001, 19: 535-542; Shulman et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys., 1999, 44: 349-353); and nucleic acid base derivatives, e.g., halogenated purines or pyrimidines, such as 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (Buchholz et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys., 1995, 32: 1053-1058). In certain embodiments, conjugates of the invention comprise a radioisotope. Examples of suitable radioisotopes include any α-, β- or γ-emitter, which, when localized at a tumor site, results in cell destruction (S. E. Order, “Analysis, Results, and Future Prospective of the Therapeutic Use of Radiolabeled Antibody in Cancer Therapy”, Monoclonal Antibodies for Cancer Detection and Therapy, R. W. Baldwin et al. (Eds.), Academic Press, 1985). Examples of such radioisotopes include, but are not limited to, iodine-131 (131I), iodine-125 (125I), bismuth-212 (212Bi), bismuth-213 (213Bi), astatine-211 (211At), rhenium-186 (186Re), rhenium-188 (188Re), phosphorus-32 (32P), yttrium-90 (90yY), samarium-153 (153Sm), and lutetium-177 (177Lu). In certain embodiments, conjugates of the invention comprise a superantigen or biologically active portion thereof. Superantigens constitute a group of bacterial and viral proteins that are extremely efficient in activating a large fraction of the T-cell population. Superantigens bind directly to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) without being processed. In fact, superantigens bind unprocessed outside the antigenbinding groove on the MHC class II molecules, thereby avoiding most of the polymorphism in the conventional peptide-binding site. A superantigen-based tumor therapeutic approach has been developed for the treatment of solid tumors. In this approach, a targeting moiety, for example, an antibody or antibody fragment, is conjugated to a superantigen, providing a targeted superantigen. If the antibody, or antibody fragment, recognizes a tumor-associated antigen, the targeted superantigen, bound to tumors cells, can trigger superantigen-activated cytotoxic T-cells to kill the tumor cells directly by superantigen-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. (See, e.g., Søgaard et al., (1996) “Antibody-targeted superantigens in cancer immunotherapy,” Immunotechnology, 2(3): 151-162, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.) Superantigen-based tumor therapeutics have had some success. For example, fusion proteins with wild-type staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) have been investigated in clinical trials of colorectal and pancreatic cancer (Giantonio et al., J. Clin. Oncol., 1997, 15: 1994-2007; Alpaugh et a., Clin. Cancer Res., 1998, 4: 1903-1914; Cheng et al., J. Clin. Oncol., 2004, 22: 602-609; the entire contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference); staphylococcal superantigens of the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc) have been studied for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (Terman et al., Clin. Chest Med., 2006, 27: 321-324, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference), and staphylococcal enterotoxin B has been evaluated for the intravesical immunotherapy of superficial bladder cancer (Perabo et al., Int. J. Cancer, 2005, 115: 591-598, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference). A superantigen, or a biologically active portion thereof, can be associated to a compound of the invention to form a conjugate according to the present invention and used in a therapy, e.g., an anti-cancer therapy, as described herein. Examples of superantigens suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) (e.g., staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) or staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE)), Streptococcus pyogenes exotoxin (SPE), Staphylococcus aureus toxic shock-syndrome toxin (TSST-1), streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin (SME), streptococcal superantigen (SSA), and staphylococcal superantigens of the enterotoxin gene cluster. As known to one skilled in the art, the three-dimensional structures of the above listed superantigens can be obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Similarly, the nucleic acid sequences and the amino acid sequences of the above listed superantigens and other superantigens can be obtained from GenBank. In certain embodiments, a conjugate of the present invention may be used in directed enzyme prodrug therapy. In a directed enzyme prodrug therapy approach, a directed/targeted enzyme and a prodrug are administered to a subject, wherein the targeted enzyme is specifically localized to a portion of the subject's body where it converts the prodrug into an active drug. The prodrug can be converted to an active drug in one step (by the targeted enzyme) or in more than one step. For example, the prodrug can be converted to a precursor of an active drug by the targeted enzyme. The precursor can then be converted into the active drug by, for example, the catalytic activity of one or more additional targeted enzymes, one or more non-targeted enzymes administered to the subject, one or more enzymes naturally present in the subject or at the target site in the subject (e.g., a protease, phosphatase, kinase or polymerase), by an agent that is administered to the subject, and/or by a chemical process that is not enzymatically catalyzed (e.g., oxidation, hydrolysis, isomerization, epimerization, etc.). Different approaches have been used to direct/target the enzyme to the site of interest. For example, in ADEPT (antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy), an antibody designed/developed against a tumor antigen is linked to an enzyme and injected in a subject, resulting in selective binding of the enzyme to the tumor. When the discrimination between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels is sufficient, a prodrug is administered to the subject. The prodrug is converted to its active form by the enzyme only within the tumor. Selectivity is achieved by the tumor specificity of the antibody and by delaying prodrug administration until there is a large differential between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels. Early clinical trials are promising and indicate that ADEPT may become an effective treatment for all solid cancers for which tumor-associated or tumor-specific antibodies are known. Tumors have also been targeted with the genes encoding for prodrug activating enzymes. This approach has been called virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (VDEPT) or more generally GDEPT (gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy, and has shown good results in laboratory systems. Other versions of directed enzyme prodrug therapy include PDEPT (polymer-directed enzyme prodrug therapy), LEAPT (lectin-directed enzyme-activated prodrug therapy), and CDEPT (clostridial-directed enzyme prodrug therapy). A conjugate according to the present invention, which comprises a prodrug activating enzyme associated with a compound of the invention, can be used in a similar way. Nonlimiting examples of enzyme/prodrug/active drug combinations suitable for use in the present invention are described, for example, in Bagshawe et al., Current Opinions in Immunology, 1999, 11: 579-583; Wilman, “Prodrugs in Cancer Therapy”, Biochemical Society Transactions, 14: 375-382, 615th Meeting, Belfast, 1986; Stella et al., “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach To Targeted Drug Delivery”, in “Directed Drug Delivery”, Borchardt et al., (Eds), pp. 247-267 (Humana Press, 1985). Nonlimiting examples of enzyme/prodrug/active anti-cancer drug combinations are described, for example, in Rooseboom et al., Pharmacol. Reviews, 2004, 56: 53-102. Examples of prodrug activating enzymes include, but are not limited to, nitroreductase, cytochrome P450, purine-nucleoside phosphorylase, thymidine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, β-glucuronidase, carboxypeptidase, penicillin amidase, β-lactamase, cytosine deaminase, and methionine γ-lyase. Examples of anti-cancer drugs that can be formed in vivo by activation of a prodrug by a prodrug activating enzyme include, but are not limited to, 5-(aziridin-1-yl)-4-hydroxyl-amino-2-nitro-benzamide, isophosphoramide mustard, phosphoramide mustard, 2-fluoroadenine, 6-methylpurine, ganciclovir-triphosphate nucleotide, etoposide, mitomycin C, p-[N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]phenol (POM), doxorubicin, oxazolidinone, 9-aminocamptothecin, mustard, methotrexate, benzoic acid mustard, doxorubicin, adriamycin, daunomycin, carminomycin, bleomycins, esperamicins, melphalan, palytoxin, 4-desacetylvinblastine-3-carboxylic acid hydrazide, phenylenediamine mustard, 4′-carboxyphthalato(1,2-cyclohexane-diamine) platinum, taxol, 5-fluorouracil, methylselenol, and carbonothionic difluoride. In certain embodiments, a therapeutic (e.g., anti-cancer) agent within a conjugate of the present invention comprises an anti-angiogenic agent. Antiangiogenic agents suitable for use in the present invention include any molecule, compound, or factor that blocks, inhibits, slows down, or reduces the process of angiogenesis, or the process by which new blood vessels form by developing from preexisting vessels. Such a molecule, compound, or factor can block angiogenesis by blocking, inhibiting, slowing down, or reducing any of the steps involved in angiogenesis, including (but not limited to) steps of (1) dissolution of the membrane of the originating vessel, (2) migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, and (3) formation of new vasculature by migrating cells. Examples of anti-angiogenic agents include, but are not limited to, bevacizumab (AVASTIN®), celecoxib (CELEBREX®), endostatin, thalidomide, EMD121974 (Cilengitide), TNP-470, squalamine, combretastatin A4, interferon-α, anti-VEGF antibody, SU5416, SU6668, PTK787/2K 22584, Marimistal, AG3340, COL-3, Neovastat, and BMS-275291. Anti-angiogenic agents may be used in a variety of therapeutic contexts, including, but not limited to, anti-cancer therapies and therapies for macular degeneration. As will be recognized by one skilled in the art, the specific examples of therapeutic agents cited herein represent only a very small number of the therapeutic agents that are suitable for use in the practice of the present invention. Detection Entities Multifunctional agents described herein in many embodiments comprise at least one detection entity, in addition to a targeting entity described above. A detection entity may be any entity that allows detection of a targeting agent after binding to a tissue or localization at a system of interest. Any of a wide variety of detectable agents can be used as detection entity (e.g., labeling moieties) in multifunctional conjugate agents of the present invention. A detection entity may be directly detectable or indirectly detectable. Examples of detection entity include, but are not limited to: various ligands, radionuclides (e.g., 3H, 14C, 18F, 19F, 32P, 35S, 135I, 125I, 123I, 64Cu, 187Re, 111In, 90Y, 99mTc, 177Lu, etc.), fluorescent dyes (for specific exemplary fluorescent dyes, see below), chemiluminescent agents (such as, for example, acridinum esters, stabilized dioxetanes, and the like), bioluminescent agents, spectrally resolvable inorganic fluorescent semiconductors nanocrystals (i.e., quantum dots), metal nanoparticles (e.g., gold, silver, copper, platinum, etc.) nanoclusters, paramagnetic metal ions, enzymes (for specific examples of enzymes, see below), colorimetric labels (such as, for example, dyes, colloidal gold, and the like), biotin, dioxigenin, haptens, and proteins for which antisera or monoclonal antibodies are available.

Suitable fluorescent dyes include, but are not limited to, fluorescein and fluorescein dyes (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanine or FITC, naphthofluorescein, 4′,5′-dichloro-2′,7′-dimethoxyfluorescein, carboxyfluorescein or FAM, etc.), carbocyanine, merocyanine, styryl dyes, oxonol dyes, phycoerythrin, erythrosin, eosin, rhodamine dyes (e.g., carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine or TAMRA, carboxyrhodamine 6G, carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), lissamine rhodamine B, rhodamine 6G, rhodamine Green, rhodamine Red, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR), etc.), coumarin and coumarin dyes (e.g., methoxycoumarin, dialkylaminocoumarin, hydroxycoumarin, aminomethylcoumarin (AMCA), etc.), Oregon Green Dyes (e.g., Oregon Green 488, Oregon Green 500, Oregon Green 514., etc.), Texas Red, Texas Red-X, Spectrum Red™, Spectrum Green™, cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy-3™, Cy-5™, Cy-3.5™, Cy-5.5™ etc.), Alexa Fluor dyes (e.g., Alexa Fluor 350, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 532, Alexa Fluor 546, Alexa Fluor 568, Alexa Fluor 594, Alexa Fluor 633, Alexa Fluor 660, Alexa Fluor 680, etc.), BODIPY dyes (e.g., BODIPY FL, BODIPY R6G, BODIPY TMR, BODIPY TR, BODIPY 530/550, BODIPY 558/568, BODIPY 564/570, BODIPY 576/589, BODIPY 581/591, BODIPY 630/650, BODIPY 650/665, etc.), IRDyes (e.g., IRD40, IRD 700, IRD 800, etc.), and the like. For more examples of suitable fluorescent dyes and methods for coupling fluorescent dyes to other chemical entities such as proteins and peptides, see, for example, “The Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products”, 9111Ed., Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, Oreg. Favorable properties of fluorescent labeling agents include high molar absorption coefficient, high fluorescence quantum yield, and photostability. In certain embodiments, labeling fluorophores desirably exhibit absorption and emission wavelengths in the visible (i.e., between 400 and 750 nm) rather than in the ultraviolet range of the spectrum (i.e., lower than 400 nm). In certain embodiments, a detection entity comprises an enzyme. Examples of suitable enzymes include, but are not limited to, those used in an ELISA, e.g., horseradish peroxidase, beta-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, etc. Other examples include beta-glucuronidase, beta-D-glucosidase, urease, glucose oxidase, etc. An enzyme may be conjugated to a targeting entity (e.g., compound of the invention of formula I) using a linker group such as a carbodiimide, a diisocyanate, a glutaraldehyde, and the like. More detailed description of suitable linkers is provided elsewhere herein. In certain embodiments, a detection entity comprises a radioisotope that is detectable by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or Position Emission Tomography (PET).

Examples of such radioisotopes include, but are not limited to, iodine-131 (131I), and technetium-99m (99mTc). In certain embodiments, a detection entity comprises a paramagnetic metal ion that is a good contrast enhancer in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Examples of such paramagnetic metal ions include, but are not limited to, gadolinium III (Gd3+), chromium III (Cr3+), dysprosium III (Dy3+), iron III (Fe3+), manganese II (Mn2+), and ytterbium III (Yb3+). In certain embodiments, the detection entity comprises gadolinium III (Gd3+). Gadolinium is an FDA-approved contrast agent for MRI, which accumulates in abnormal tissues causing these abnormal areas to become very bright (enhanced) on the magnetic resonance image. Gadolinium is known to provide great contrast between normal and abnormal tissues in different areas of the body, in particular in the brain. In certain embodiments, a labeling moiety comprises a stable paramagnetic isotope detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Examples of suitable stable paramagnetic isotopes include, but are not limited to, carbon-13 (13C) and fluorine-19 (19F). Conjugation As stated above, multifunctional agents described herein comprise multiple entities, each having at least one function. As already noted, certain embodiments of contemplated multifunctional agents comprise a targeting entity and at least one of the following entities: a detection entity and a therapeutic entity. In some embodiments, a multifunctional agent of the invention contains a targeting entity and a therapeutic entity; but not a detection entity. In some embodiments, a multifunctional agent of the invention contains a targeting entity; a detection entity; but not a therapeutic entity. In some embodiments, a multifunctional agent of the invention contains a targeting entity; a therapeutic entity; and a detection entity. In any of contemplated embodiments, the entities of an agent are conjugated to one another. Conjugation of various entities to form a multifunctional agent is not limited to particular modes of conjugation. For example, two entities may be covalently conjugated directly to each other. Alternatively, two entities may be indirectly conjugated to each other, such as via a linker entity. In some embodiments, a multifunctional agent may include different types of conjugation within the agent, such that some entities of the agent are conjugated via direct conjugation while other entities of the agent are indirectly conjugated via one or more linkers. In some embodiments, a multifunctional agent of the invention comprises a single type of a linker entity. In other embodiments, a multifunctional agent of the invention comprises more than one types of a linker entities. In some embodiments, a multifunctional agent includes a single type of linker entities but of varying length. In many of the embodiments described herein, association between or amongst entities contained in a multifunctional agent is covalent. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the moieties may be attached to each other either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a linker, as described above). In certain embodiments, where one entity (such as a targeting entity) and a second entity of a multifunctional agent are directly covalently linked to each other, such direct covalent conjugation can be through a linkage (e.g., a linker or linking entity) such as an amide, ester, carbon-carbon, disulfide, carbamate, ether, thioether, urea, amine, or carbonate linkage. Covalent conjugation can be achieved by taking advantage of functional groups present on the first entity and/or the second entity of the multifunctional agent. Alternatively, a non-critical amino acid may be replaced by another amino acid that will introduce a useful group (such as amino, carboxy or sulfhydryl) for coupling purposes. Alternatively, an additional amino acid may be added to at least one of the entities of the multifunctional agent to introduce a useful group (such as amino, carboxy or sulfhydryl) for coupling purposes. Suitable functional groups that can be used to attach moieties together include, but are not limited to, amines, anhydrides, hydroxyl groups, carboxy groups, thiols, and the like. An activating agent, such as a carbodiimide, can be used to form a direct linkage. A wide variety of activating agents are known in the art and are suitable for conjugating one entity to a second entity. In other embodiments, entities of a multifunctional agent embraced by the present invention are indirectly covalently linked to each other via a linker group. Such a linker group may also be referred to as a linker or a linking entity. This can be accomplished by using any number of stable bifunctional agents well known in the art, including homofunctional and heterofunctional agents (for examples of such agents, see, e.g., Pierce Catalog and Handbook). The use of a bifunctional linker differs from the use of an activating agent in that the former results in a linking moiety being present in the resulting conjugate (agent), whereas the latter results in a direct coupling between the two moieties involved in the reaction. The role of a bifunctional linker may be to allow reaction between two otherwise inert moieties. Alternatively or additionally, the bifunctional linker that becomes part of the reaction product may be selected such that it confers some degree of conformational flexibility to the targeting agent in relation to the detecting moiety (e.g., the bifunctional linker comprises a straight alkyl chain containing several atoms, for example, the straight alkyl chain contains between 2 and 10 carbon atoms). Alternatively or additionally, the bifunctional linker may be selected such that the linkage formed between a targeting agent and therapeutic agent is cleavable, e.g. hydrolysable (for examples of such linkers, see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,773,001; 5,739,116 and 5,877,296, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Such linkers, for example, may be used when higher activity of certain entities, such as a targeting agent (e.g., compound of formula I) and/or of a therapeutic entity is observed after hydrolysis of the conjugate. Exemplary mechanisms by which an entity may be cleaved from a multifunctional agent include hydrolysis in the acidic pH of the lysosomes (hydrazones, acetals, and cis-aconitate-like amides), peptide cleavage by lysosomal enzymes (the capthepsins and other lysosomal enzymes), and reduction of disulfides). Another mechanism by which such an entity is cleaved from the multifunctional agent includes hydrolysis at physiological pH extra- or intra-cellularly. This mechanism applies when the crosslinker used to couple one entity to another entity is a biodegradable/bioerodible component, such as polydextran and the like. For example, hydrazone-containing multifunctional agents can be made with introduced carbonyl groups that provide the desired release properties. Multifunctional agents can also be made with a linker that comprise an alkyl chain with a disulfide group at one end and a hydrazine derivative at the other end. Linkers containing functional groups other than hydrazones also have the potential to be cleaved in the acidic milieu of lysosomes. For example, multifunctional agents can be made from thiol-reactive linkers that contain a group other than a hydrazone that is cleavable intracellularly, such as esters, amides, and acetals/ketals. Another example of class of pH sensitive linkers are the cis-aconitates, which have a carboxylic acid group juxtaposed to an amide group. The carboxylic acid accelerates amide hydrolysis in the acidic lysosomes. Linkers that achieve a similar type of hydrolysis rate acceleration with several other types of structures can also be used. Another potential release method for targeting agents is the enzymatic hydrolysis of peptides by the lysosomal enzymes. In one example, a peptidic toxin is attached via an amide bond to para-aminobenzyl alcohol and then a carbamate or carbonate is made between the benzyl alcohol and the therapeutic agent. Cleavage of the peptide leads to collapse of the amino benzyl carbamate or carbonate, and release of the therapeutic agent. In another example, a phenol can be cleaved by collapse of the linker instead of the carbamate. In another variation, disulfide reduction is used to initiate the collapse of a para-mercaptobenzyl carbamate or carbonate. Useful linkers which may be used as a linking entity of a multifunctional agent provided herein include, without limitation: polyethylene glycol, a copolymer of ethylene glycol, a polypropylene glycol, a copolymer of propylene glycol, a carboxymethylcellulose, a polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a poly-1,3-dioxolane, a poly-1,3,6-trioxane, an ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, a polyaminoacid, a dextran n-vinyl pyrrolidone, a poly n-vinyl pyrrolidone, a propylene glycol homopolymer, a propylene oxide polymer, an ethylene oxide polymer, a polyoxyethylated polyol, a polyvinyl alcohol, a linear or branched glycosylated chain, a polyacetal, a long chain fatty acid, a long chain hydrophobic aliphatic group. Embraced also herein are multifunctional agents that include at least one entity which involves non-covalent association. Examples of non-covalent interactions include, but are not limited to, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, dipole interactions, van der Waals interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Irrespective of the nature of the binding, interaction, or coupling, the association between a first entity and a second entity is, in some embodiments, selective, specific and strong enough so that the second entity contained in the agent does not dissociate from the first entity before or during transport/delivery to and into the target. Thus, Association amongst multiple entities of a multifunctional agent may be achieved using any chemical, biochemical, enzymatic, or genetic coupling known to one skilled in the art. EXEMPLIFICATION As depicted in the Examples below, in certain exemplary embodiments, compounds are prepared according to the following general procedures. It will be appreciated that, although the general methods depict the synthesis of certain compounds of the present invention, the following general methods, and other methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, can be applied to all compounds and subclasses and species of each of these compounds, as described herein. In certain embodiments, compounds of formula I are prepared according to the procedure outlined in Scheme 1. The syntheses were executed according to a general scheme starting from a given ketone and reacting it under Strecker reaction conditions, using sodium cyanide and 4-amino-2-fluoro-N-methylbenzamide. The resulting cyanamine was then reacted with 4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylaniline (X═CH) or a 2-cyano-3-trifluoromethyl-5-aminopyridine (X═N) in the present of thiophosgene to give the desired thiohydantoins after acid hydrolysis of the intermediate imine. Example 1 Strecker Reaction A general procedure for the first step of the synthesis of compounds of formula I follows. To a mixture of 4-amino-2-fluoro-N-methylbenzamide (0.3 mmol) and desired ketone (1.0-2.0 eq) in glacial acetic acid (2 mL) was added NaCN (100 mg, 2.0 mmol, 7.0 eq), and the mixture was heated to 80° C. overnight. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in water (20 mL), then pH was brought to neutrality with aqueous saturated NaHCO3 solution. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×50 mL), and the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solution was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was chromatographed on a short path silica gel column using the gradient hexane/ethyl acetate 2/1 to 1/1.5 (v/v) to yield each desired product in more than 85% yield. Example 2 Thiohydantoin Synthesis A general procedure for the second step of the synthesis of compounds of formula I follows. Thiophosgene (5.1 uL, 66 umol) was added dropwise to a solution of 5-amino-2-cyano-3-trifluoromethylpyridine or 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (60 umol) and the given Strecker products above N-methyl-4-(1-cyanocycloalkylamino)-2-fluorobenzamides (60 umol) in dry DMA (0.6 mL) under argon at 0° C. After 5 min, the solution was stirred overnight at 60 C. At room temperature, this mixture was then diluted with MeOH (1 mL) and aq. 2.0 N HCl (0.5 mL), and the reaction was brought to reflux for 2 hours. After cooling to ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into ice water (10 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (3×20 mL). The combined organic layers were briefly dried over anhydrous Mg2SO4, concentrated and the resulting residue was chromatographed on silica gel using the gradient system hexane/ethyl acetate 2/1 to 1.5/1 (v/v) to yield the desired thiohydantoin in yields up to 90%. The following non-limiting examples illustrate analytical data obtained for compounds of formula I produced by the synthesis of Scheme 1. Where a given compound can exist as two or more enantiomers or diastereomers, such isomers can be separated by techniques well known in the art such as HPLC.

Example 17 In Vitro GFP Reporter Assay Compounds of the present invention were assayed in an in vitro GFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter assay, which can be used to determine the effect of compounds on AR transcriptional activity. LNCaP (prostate cancer) cells were engineered to express an AR-regulated GFP reporter (Pb.PSE.EGFP), such that GFP expression indicates AR transcriptional activity. A representative procedure for this assay follows. LNCaP-Pb.PSE.EGFP cells overexpressing either wild-type AR (WT) or the F876L mutant AR (FL) were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or with either 1 uM or 10 uM of Enzalutamide or ARN509, or 10 uM of a compound of formula I. After 4 days the treated cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis and the histogram overlays of GFP expression (FL1) were displayed Results of certain compounds are depicted (together with the geometric mean fluorescence intensity is indicated in the legends below the histogram) in each of FIGS. 1 through 15.

In some embodiments, a provided compound is considered to be a modulator of a tested AR if it results in similar effects on induced GFP expression as compared with a reference androgen or anti-androgen. Example 18 AR Luciferase Reporter Assay Compounds of the present invention were assayed in an in vitro AR luciferase reporter assay reporter assay, which can be used to determine the effect of compounds on AR transcriptional activity. CV1 cells were engineered to express an AR-regulated luciferase reporter, such that luciferase expression indicates AR transcriptional activity. A representative procedure for this assay follows. CV1 cells (106 cells/10 cm plate) were cotransfected with 50 ng of SV40 Renilla Luciferase, 5 ug of ARE(4X)-Luciferase, and 10 ug of one pWZL-AR expression construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection media was removed 4-6 hours later and replaced with phenol red free DME-HG containing 10% charcoal stripped serum. The following day each plate was split into 24- or 48-well plates, in 10% CSS media, containing the indicated drugs in triplicate. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours later, luciferase activity was assayed using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a 96-well luminometer (Turner Biosystems).

Example 19 In Vitro Cell Viability Assay Compounds of the present invention were assayed in an in vitro cell viability assay, which can be used to determine the effect of compounds on LNCaP cell growth and survival. A representative procedure for this assay follows. LNCaP-Pb.PSE-EGFP cells for flow cytometric analysis were treated with test compounds (1 uM or 10 uM) for 4-6 days, changing media and drug every 2-3 days. Cells were collected using Accumax dissociation solution (Innovative Cell Technologies) and dead cells were counterstained using TO-PRO3-Iodide (Invitrogen). EGFP expression was measured using the BD-FACSCalibur flow cytometer using the 488 nm laser and 530/30 bandpass filter to detect EGFP expression, and the 633 nm laser and 661/16 bandpass filter to detect TO-PRO3-Iodide labeled dead cells. For each sample, 2-5×104 cell events were collected and analysis was done using FlowJo software. FACS-sorting of LNCaP-Pb.PSE.EGFP cells was performed on a BD FACSVantage cell sorter.

CellTiterGLO assay was performed on days 1, 4, and 7 to determine cell viability. Results of a cell viability assay in CWR22PC cells are depicted in FIG. 18. On the y-axis RLU means relative light units. More light scattered means more viable cells. In some embodiments, a provided compound is considered to be a modulator of a tested AR if it results in similar effects on cell viability as compared with a reference androgen or anti-androgen. Example 21 Initial Models of AR-Antiandrogen Complex Structures No structures have been solved experimentally for enzalutamide or ARN-509 in complex with AR (agonist or antagonist conformation). Therefore, 3D structures of antiandrogens were first built using the computer program Gaussview (version 4.1.2, part of the computer program Gaussian 03) and then geometrically optimized in a quantum mechanical force field at the level of restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) 6-31g* using the program Gaussian 03. The partial atomic charges were derived from the optimized structures by Restrained ElectroStatic Potential (RESP) fitting to the RHF/6-31g* potentials. The other parameters modeling the antiandrogens were taken from the CHARMm22 force field after assigning CHARMm22 atom types to antiandrogens with an in-house program. The initial AR-antiandrogen complex structures were then modeled with the molecular modeling program CHARMM5,6. Starting with the atomic coordinates of AR WT and A ring of 51 in the template crystal structure (PDB accession code, 2AXA), the side chain of residue 761 were replaced with CHARMm22-parameterized side chain of a leucine in cases of AR F876L and a CH group on the A ring was replaced with a nitrogen in cases of ARN-509. The rest of each antiandrogen was “grown” from the A ring using the ideal, unbound structures solved by geometry optimization. Missing side chain atoms were built using standard CHARMm22 parameters and hydrogen atoms were added with the HBUILD module of CHARMM. All these newly-introduced atoms without 3D crystal coordinates treated flexible and the rest under harmonic constraints with the force constant of 100 Kcal/mol/Å2, each AR-antiandrogen complex structure was energetically minimized with 1 round of 100-step steepest decent followed by 2 rounds of 100-step Adopted-Basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) energy minimization. Harmonic constraints were reset at the beginning of each round of minimization. No nonbonded cutoff was used. Solvent effects were implicitly modeled in this stage with a distance-dependent dielectric constant. Example 22 Molecular Dynamics Simulations The all-atom MD simulations were performed with explicit solvent atoms using the program CHARMM (version 36a1). Each initial AR-antiandrogen model was first centered and overlaid with a 50 Å×50 Å×50 Å cube of approximately 47,000 equilibrated water molecules. Any water molecule whose oxygen atom was within 2.8 Å away from any non-hydrogen atom of AR or antiandrogen was removed. Proper amount of sodium and chloride ions were automatically added to achieve overall charge neutrality and physiological level of ion concentration (0.145 M). Their positions were optimized with 10 independent trajectories of randomly replacing water molecules and performing 50 steps of steepest decent and 125 steps of ABNR energy minimization. The molecular system including AR, antiandrogen, waters, and ions was heated to 298 K and equilibrated with two rounds of 0.1-ns MD simulations under successively weaker harmonic constraints on AR or antiandrogen atoms. After the MD equilibration, three sets of random velocities were assigned to initiate three independent 10-ns MD productions. The MD equilibration and production were performed using the crystal form of rhombic dodecahedron (RHDO) and the canonical ensemble (NVT). A nonbonded cutoff of 10 Å, periodic boundary conditions in conjunction with Ewald summation method, the leapfrog Verlet integrator, and the Hoover thermostat for pressure and temperature were used. The timestep was set as 2 fs. Parallel jobs for MD simulations were run on a computer cluster of Intel Xeon X5650 series (2.66 GHz and 4 GB memory for each CPU). Structural models were visualized in a molecular graphics program, UCSF Chimera. The default option used when aligning structures. Results of the molecular modeling experiments are depicted in FIGS. 19 through 23. In some embodiments, the AR modulator, agonist or antagonist, as described herein, is one dimensioned to fit within the pocket defined by the computational model described above. Example 23 Ligand Binding Assay The relative binding affinity of DHT and AR antagonists in LNCaP cells ectopically expressing AR WT or AR F876L was determined using a competition assay in which increasing concentrations of cold competitor are added to cells pre-incubated with 18F-FDHT. The cells were propagated in RPMI media supplemented with 10% CSS (charcoal-stripped, dextran-treated fetal bovine serum). Cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, and triplicate cell samples were mixed with 20,000 cpm 18F-FDHT and increasing amounts of cold competitor (0.1 nM to 10 uM). The solutions were shaken on an orbital shaker at ambient temperature, and after 1 hour the cells were isolated and washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline using a Brandel cell harvester (Gaithersburg, Md.). All the isolated cell samples were counted using a scintillation counter, with appropriate standards of total activity and blank controls, and the specific uptake of 18F-FDHT determined. These data were plotted against the concentration of the cold competitor to give sigmoidal displacement curves. The IC50 values were determined using a one site model and a least squares curve fitting routine (Origin, OriginLab, Northampton, Mass.) with the R2 of the curve fit being >0.99. These data show that DHT binds to both AR WT and AR F876L expressing cells at a comparable IC50. However, MDV3100 is able to displace 18F-FDHT from the mutant AR F876L cells at a lower IC50 than for AR WT cells, suggesting a higher binding affinity of MDV3100 to the AR F876L mutant. These data are in line with previous data that showed the mutant AR T877A, which confers agonism on the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide, binds to hydroxyflutamide (and several other hormones) with a higher affinity than to AR WT. (Ozers, et al. “The androgen receptor T877A mutant recruits LXXLL and FXXLF peptides differently than wild-type androgen receptor in a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay.” Biochemistry (2007) 46, 683). In some embodiments, a provided compound is considered to be a modulator, agonist or antagonist of a tested AR if it displaces 18F-FDHT from an AR.
