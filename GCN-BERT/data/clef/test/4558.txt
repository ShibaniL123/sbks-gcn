Example 111A
2-[(4-Methylphenyl)sulfonyl]ethyl-4-amino-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 9.5 ml (123.5 mmol) of TFA were added to a suspension of 560 mg (1.24 mmol) of the compound from Example 110A in 28 ml of dichloromethane, and the mixture was stirred at 40Â° C. for 2 h, followed by 48 h at RT. The mixture was then concentrated and repeatedly dichloromethane was added and the mixture was concentrated again. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 3). This gave 466 mg (about 100% of theory, purity about 95%) of the title compound
