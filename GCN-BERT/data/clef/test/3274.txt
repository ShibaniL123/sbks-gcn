Triethylammonium (N-(8-((3,4,6-O-triacetyl-2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-β-D-galactopyranosyl)oxy)-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl)-3-(((4,4',4″-trimethoxytrityl)oxy)methyl)azetidin-3-yl)methoxy)-4-oxobutanoate 18k
Compound 10k (0.499 g, 0.54 mmol), succinic anhydride (0.540 g, 5.4 mmol) and pyridine (2.0 mL) were stirred at room temperature for 5 days. The reaction mixture was quenched with water and triethylamine (0.4 mL) for 4 h, evaporated to oil, diluted with DCM (100 mL), and washed with 10% aqueous citric acid. Organic phase was basified with triethylamine (0.2 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated. The residue was separated on a silica gel column (1% Et3N, 0-5% MeOH, DCM) to yield 18k (0.535 g, 88.2%).
