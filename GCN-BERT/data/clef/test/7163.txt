FIELD [00013 The; present invention relates to a. water vapor barrier film having high tM-dh.ani.cai ®fcx®n.gth# good flexibility, good flame retardancy, and. good, water vapor barrier performance. The present invention aiso: relates to a dispersion for water vapor barrier film® which is intended to be used to- produce the water vapor barrier film a method for producing the water vapor barrier film, a solar cell back, sheet incorporating the water vapor sorrier film, and a solar cell inoorpsrating the water vapor sorrier film or the solas cell hack, sheet, BACKGROUND ART 100021 A recent trend towards ministwrirafion, thinning, and sophist.! out ion in the fields of electronic devices has crested a desire for a flexible, tophisti.eetod film having excellent properties including heat resistance, chemical resistance, hydrolysis resistance# flame refcardanoy, non™ combustibility, dimensional stability, and water vapor barrier performance< Convent ions! films for -electronic devices mostly include a substrate made of an organic polymer material, A common film, having gas barrier performance includes a polymer resin film substrate and a gas barrier layer on one or both of the surfaces of the polymer resin film substrate Scot a gas barrier layer is made of, for example, alusiinum oxide, silicon oxide, or silicon nitride, and can. be formed by various techniques such as CYB and FYD, 10003] Examples of heat-rasistant films de-TOioped so far are films made of f lucre-resin or thin glass sheets. Onfort.unat.ely, fluororesdn is expensive, and git's a poor dimensional stability and. poor water vapor barrier performance, Addlttonally, the maximum, service temperature of fluororesin is as low as about 200*0, which means that it cannot withstand use at high temperatures« hmcng organic polymer materials, engineering plastics have the highest heat resistance of about 350*C« Even these plastics cannot bo used for applications .requiring gas barrier performance and water vapor barrier performance at further higher temperatures.. On the other hand, thin glass sheets ere inexpensive, and have vary good heat resistance and water vapor barrier performance, but are not flexible enough. For these reasons, inorganic sheets and metal sheets have been used as materials having gas barrier performance and water vapor barrier performance at high temperatotea. [00041 Inorganic sheets are sheets manufactured by processing natural or synthetic minerals, such as mica or vermicnlite. These sheets have high heat resistance, and have been used fur gland packings to exhibit acceptable performance as gas sealing members. Unfortunately, these inorganic sheets tail to completely block paths through which small gas molecules flow because It is difficult to produce these sheets ns dense sheets, liamely, their gas. barrier performance is not good enough, in addition, their flexibility is poor. On the ether hand, metal, sheets have good gas barrier performance, hut are poor in, for example, weather resistance, electric insulation properties, end chemical reelstance. These disadvantages limit the range of their applications* For applications ander sorer® environment, for example, as protective films or book shoots fox solar cells or other devices, films, having the following properties are required# for example;: weather resistance Ca*g* ultraviolet semlalanoc, moisture resistance, heat roiisfancOj. salt corrosion resistance} t water vapor harrier performance! electric insolation properties! mechanical strength; chemical resistance; and adhesion to seeling materials * Mac required ere films that haw® gas barrier performance even under severer environment compared to conventional metarials. [000S] Generally used plastic films such as polyiadde films are flexible, but have poor water vapor harrier performance and poor heat resistance* feny attempts have the ref era bean made: in recent years to produce more sophisticated films by mining a synthetic resin with an inorganic; compound, addition of an inorganic compound in an .increasing amount sorely achieves better heat resistance, but decreases the flexibility and mechanical strength* It has been thus difficult to produce a film having good flexibility, good water vapor barrier performance, and high mechanical strength. [0006] There are reports on films produced from a mixture of a polyimi.de resin, and an inorganic compound such as clay. Usually, such an inorganic compeund is not homogeneously mixed with a polyimtde reals, and is separated to provide an inhomogeneoua film* Patent Literatures 1 to 4 teach films obtained from a homogeneous dispersion of polylstide and inorganic compounds, using a clay additive, the interlayer 1όηό of which are substituted by an organic ion* Since the clay contains an organic material, the resulting films have a defect of low heat resistance which causes the films to be burnt when exposed to flame. .& further disadvantage is insufficient water vapor barrier performance. |000?i Patent Literatures; S and 6 teach films produced using a dilute dispersion for filer which contains nonvolatile components. in a proportion of 51 by weight or less of the total weight of the dispersion. These techniques* however* provide flics mainly composed of ofganio components with an inorganic compound content of ft by weight or loss of the total nonvolatile coupon®nts. Such films have poor heat resistance. 1000 8:: Patent Literstuxes 7 and S discloee films having an inorganic compound content of 80% by weight or more of the total nonvolatile components, fhesu films? however* are easily torn* have low mechanical strength and low h&ndleshi1ityf and thus ate difficult to handle. Additionally* if is difficult to produce thicker films by these technique♦ Films having a thickness of 40 pm. or more develop cracks or break in the process of production,: [0009] Patent Literature 9 teaches a technique of using a polyurethane adhesive with increased durability, as determined by an accelerated test at 8 5*0: and BStRH* in a. solar cell back sheet which is a laminate of at least twosubstrates attached with a polyurethane adhesive* Still* the use of an adhesive causes the resulting beck sheet to have insufficient durability even if the durability of the adhesive is improved by the technique of Patent Literature 9, CITATION LIST - Patent Literature 10010] Patent Literature 1: JP 2ΰ03^340Ρ19 Α Patent literature 2: ■OF 2702 - 322292 A hated Li 1: a rat are 3i OF 2003-342471 A latent Literature 4: Japanese Patent No. 3744634 Patent literature Si JP 2010«S33213 Τ Fated Literature 6: JP 2010-533362 f Patent Literature 7: JP 2006-77237 A Patent Literature Si JP 2011-1237 A Patent Literature 0:: JP 2008-4631 A βο:νμαε1 or iotitooo - technical Problem i ooii] to object of the present inventions. it to provide a eater vapor barrier film baring high mechanical strength* good flexibility, good flane rstardancy* and. good eater eapor harrier performance. & further object of the present invention is to provide a dispersion for wafer vapor barrier films Third io intended to be used to produce the water vapor barrier film* a method for producing the water vapor barrier film* a solar cell back sheet incorporating the water vapor barrier film* and a solar cell incorporating the water vapor barrier film or the solar ceil back sheet. - Solution to problem |0012] The present invention provides a water vapor barrier film containing a phyllosilioate mineral and a synthetic resin* wherein the phyllosilioate adnexal includes a non-swelling clay mineral and a swelling clay mineral* the phyilosilicate mineral is present in an amount of not less than 30% by weight and. not more than 301 by weight of the total weight of the water vapor barrier film* and the water vapor barrier film has a water vapor permeability* measured at 40*C and SOIEM* of not more: than 0,5 g/nb 'day. file following description if offered to illustrate the present invention, |0013] The present inventors found out that the use of a specific amount of a phyllosilteate mineral containing a nor--sos 1 ling clay mineral and a swelling clay mineral re suit a in a eater caper barrier film, having high mechanical strength, good flexibility* good flame relardancy* and goad water vapor harrier performance, Thus* the present invention was completed. Conventional water vapor barrier films contain a swelling clay mineral., which confers water vapor barrier performance. Swelling clay minerals contain lone between layers,. It is known that beoan.se of their interlayer ions# swelling clay minerals swell, and delaminate in. a dispersion medium, and layers are gradually formed on one another while the dispere.ion. medlorn la removed* This structure exhibits barrier performance against gases such as water vapor. Onfortunafely* it is difficult to prepare a. homogeneous dispersion for films containing a swelling clay mineral (e < g, composit© films containing a swelling clay mineral* a non™swelling clay mih#ralf and a synthetic resin), and this makes it difficult to produce homogeneous films, a further disadvantage is that thick films containing a awelling clay mineral are generally difficult to produce. Such films develop cracks or break In the process of productIon, Specifically* films with a thickness of IS pm or more are difficult to produce, Additionally* it is difficult to form, films with high water vapor barrier performance from a non^swelling clay mineral because general nou"-swelliug clay minerals cannot bo formed Into films with highly oriented plate-like crystals, To defeat the above problems, the present, inventors found a way to prepare a homogenous diapersion containing specific amounts of a swelling clay mineral end. a non-swelling clay mineral by a. specific mining teotmique. Another finding in that the nee of a non-swelling clay mineral alone does not provide a film with highly oriented plate--like crystal a # but the use of this homogeneous diapersion surprisingly results in a film in which crystals of ell Olay minerals including the non-welling clay mineral are highly or lent ad, and the rese.lfci.ng film has high water vapor barrier performanceν These findings enabled the inventors to develop a. water vapor barrier film having high mechanical strength, good flexibility, good flame ratardancy, and good water vapor barrier performance, |0014ΐ The water vapor barrier film of the present invention contains a phylioailicate mineral, the water vapor barrier film, of the present invention contains a non-swelling clay mineral and a swelling clay mineral as the phylloeilieate mineral,, the term "non"swelling" herein means that a material hardly swells with the addition of water or an organic solvent, Specif leal I.y> it refers to a swelling force of less than 5 mb/2 g.
