BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are many current methods for hanging items, such as picture frames, from a wall. Several problems with current methods led to me inventing this device. Most current hooks use a straight nail (small area against wall material with low load capability), or are complex to manufacture (multiple bends and curves or two pieces or solders or welds), or use screws (large holes and usually plastic screw holder inserts). The Z-Hook uses less material, is easier to produce, and carries a larger load. The Z-Hook (AKA the EZ-Hook) is a device used to hang pictures or any item from a wall. The Z-Hook uses a single piece of metal with as little as 2 bends. It can be used in conjunction with other items (like shelf brackets, TV wall mounts, clothes hooks) that have a slot that will fit the Z-Hook. This invention is being filed as a Non-Provisional Utility Patent and there do not seem to be any current patents of similar devices using the main Z-Hook method and design. I have independently invented, designed, built and personally used the device known as the Z-Hook (AKA the EZ-Hook) to hang pictures, shelf braces, clothes hooks, and to mount flat screen TVs. I originally invented this device prior to Dec. 15, 2012 and have improved on the original design several times since. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The Z-Hook is a small metal device that resembles a letter “Z” in shape that is inserted into a wall to hang or secure items from. Design Benefits: 1. Single piece of flat or round metal (preferably high strength steel) makes for a stronger/more reliable Hook (no holes or connections needed in Hook like current closest device)2. Angle of A (pointed part—Drawings pg 9 FIG. 1 number 2) increases the load the Z-Hook can hold by increasing the Hook's angle against (and within) wall (doesn't need to be any more than 110 degrees off plane of straight part B).3. Length of A (pointed part—Drawings pg 9 FIG. 1 number 2 and pg 11 FIG. 4) matching depth of drywall maximizes the load the Z-Hook can hold and ensures that Z-Hook doesn't intrude on anything inside wall.4. Using flat version: the Width of the material and the fact part A (pointed part) is flat increases load area on drywall thus increasing the load the Hook can hold.5. Straight part B (vertical part—Drawings pg 9 FIG. 1 number 2 and pg 11 FIG. 4) transfers force to wall (creates fulcrum with angles of hook C and vertical B, and pointed part A and vertical part B) thus increasing the load the Z-Hook can hold.6. Hook part C (item holder—see Drawings pg 9 FIG. 1 number 2, pg 10, pg 11, pg 12) is short, its end comes effectively right from the wall (and can have a short up-bend or knob in round version) all of which increase the load the Hook can hold, allow the item to be close to the wall, and minimize damage to the back of any item hung. Manufacturing Benefits: 1. Simple design change to an existing flat metal hook actually reduces the material used (no nail). Round design improves load capability of straight nail.2. Simple design should require easier manufacture (two or three simple bends and a point) with no welds, solders, etc.3. Multiple types possible (see Drawings pg 10 FIG. 3): variations of shape also include Hooks made of the same light metal such as is currently used in hooks and a higher grade steel to make Super-Hooks for heavier loads as well as flat and round metal. Benefits to Consumer: 1. Easier to use: push pointed part into wall with hand to start, hammer in rest of way (VERY easy) or push in by hand with a hard object2. Holds a heavier load than current hooks3. Retail cost can be the same (or less) as current simple hooks (but costs less to manufacture)4. Very small, (thin for flat version) hole left after removal is easy to fill BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS Drawings included: (pgs 9, 10, 11, 12) FIG. 1 (pg 9) Shows two methods of making the Z-Hook including altering current common hooks and making the Z-Hook from basic flat metal. FIG. 2 (pg 10) Shows the basic method of making the round version of the Z-Hook using brads, or nails. FIG. 3 (pg 10) Shows drawings of the five basic variations to the Z-Hook shape. FIG. 4 (pg 11) Shows drawings basic method for using the Z-Hook. FIG. 5 (pg 12) Shows additional uses of the Z-Hook including securing clothes hooks, shelf brackets, and TV or other devices to a wall. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The Z-Hook (aka EZ-Hook) is a small metal device (shaped a little like the letter “Z”) that is inserted into a wall and is used to hang any item wished. It is made of one flat strip of metal (various lengths and strengths depending on specific need) or one round piece of metal. It is bent into a shape resembling the letter “Z” with the upper “line” (part A) bent at less of an angle from the middle, vertical “line” (part B) than a traditional letter “Z” would suggest and pointed on the end. The lower “line” (part C) is shorter than either the other two “lines”. The upper “line” (part A) is inserted into the wall at an angle such that the middle, vertical “line” (part B) is parallel with the wall. When the upper “line” (part A) is fully inserted into the wall the middle, vertical “line” (part B) ends up flat against the wall. The lower “line” (part C) then ends up sticking up from the wall at an angle. The lower “line” (part C) is used as a hook to hang objects on. Pg 9 FIG. 1 number 2 and pg 11 FIG. 4 for clarification. An additional up-bend, curve, or small knob on the end of the lower “line” (part C) can be made to reduce the possibility of damage to the item that a person hangs. Pgs 9, 10, 11, 12 By using various strengths and widths of metal, a great range of possible item-to-hang-weights are possible (including very heavy items). By creating pockets within other items (such as larger clothes hooks or shelf brackets) that match the angle of the lower “line” of the Z-Hook, it can be used to easily secure shelves (EZ-Shelves AKA Z-Shelves) or easily secure clothes hooks (EZ-Clothes Hooks AKA Z-Clothes Hooks) or even easily secure wall TV mounts (EZ-TV Mount AKA Z-TV Mount). Pg 12 FIG. 5 1. I claim that the use of a single flat piece or a single round piece of metal to form a hook (to be inserted into a wall to hang items from) resembling the letter “Z” increases strength and load carrying ability and is my invention. 2. I claim that the use of a flat, pointed part of a wall hook to insert into said wall thereby increases the area of that part against (and within) the wall material thereby increasing strength and load carrying ability and is my invention. 3. I claim that the use of the Z-Hook to secure other items (such as clothes hooks, shelves, and TV mounts) is an improvement over current methods and is my invention.
