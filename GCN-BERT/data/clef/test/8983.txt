Genus and species: Petunia hybrida. Variety denomination: ‘KLEPH13228’. BACKGROUND OF THE NEW PLANT The present invention comprises a new and distinct variety of petunia, botanically known as Petunia hybrida and hereinafter referred to by the variety name ‘KLEPH13228’. ‘KLEPH13228’ is a selection from a cross-pollination of the proprietary female petunia line ‘PH-2008-0221’ (unpatented) and the proprietary male petunia line ‘PH-2008-0448’ (unpatented). In July of 2009 the proprietary female petunia line ‘PH-2008-0221’ and the proprietary male petunia line ‘PH-2008-0448’ were cross-pollinated in Latina, Italy and seeds were obtained. The seeds were sown and plants were grown for evaluation. A plant line was selected in April 2010 in Latina, Italy and named ‘KLEPH13228’. In April 2010, ‘KLEPH13228’ was first vegetatively propagated by terminal tip cuttings and tissue culture. ‘KLEPH13228’ was found to reproduce true to type in successive generations of asexual propagation via terminal tip cuttings and tissue culture in Stuttgart, Germany. SUMMARY The following are the most outstanding and distinguishing characteristics of this new variety when grown under normal horticultural practices in Stuttgart, Germany and Latina, Italy. 1. Single, light blue colored flowers; and2. An upright, mounding, medium-compact vigour plant habit. DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS This new petunia plant is illustrated by the accompanying photographs which show an overall view of the plant. The colors shown are as true as can be reasonably obtained by conventional photographic procedures. FIG. 1 shows the overall plant habit of the plant grown in a basket. The plant is about 5 months-old grown in Stuttgart, Germany in July 2013. FIG. 2 shows a close-up of the mature inflorescence of the plant grown in a pot. The plant is about 3 months-old grown in Stuttgart, Germany in May 2013. DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW VARIETY The following detailed descriptions set forth the distinctive characteristics of ‘KLEPH13228’. The data which define these characteristics were collected from asexual reproductions carried out in Latina, Italy. Data was collected on thirteen-week-old plants grown indoors in Latina, Italy under greenhouse conditions in March of 2014. Color references are to The R.H.S.
