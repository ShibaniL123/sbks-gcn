RESISTiVELY HEATED ELECTROSURG1CAL DEVICE [0001] This app!ication claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/991 ,644 filed on May 12, 2014, the contents of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for ail purposes. F5ELD [0002] The present teachings relate to a medical device, and more specifically to an eSectrosurgical medical device that combines thermal, therapeutical, and mechanical modalities. BACKGROUND [0003] Eiectrosurgical medical devices generally fall into one of two categories: monopolar medical devices and bipolar medical devices. A monopolar medical device includes an active electrode electrically connected to an eiectrosurgical generator. A return electrode, typically in the form of a patient pad, is also electrically connected to the eiectrosurgical generator and can be placed in contact with a patient. In use, electrical current is passed from the eiectrosurgical generator to the active electrode, through a site or a region of the patient's anatomy (i.e., a tissue or a vessel) to the patient pad, and back to the eiectrosurgical generator. [0004] A bipolar medical device includes an active electrode and a return electrode adjacent the active electrode, both of which are electrically connected to an eiectrosurgical generator. In use, a site or a region of the anatomy is placed between the active and return electrodes, and electrical current passes from the eiectrosurgical generator to the active electrode, through the site or a region of the anatomy to the adjacent return electrode, and then back to the eiectrosurgical generator. [0005] Examples of eiectrosurgical medical devices may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4, 196,734; 5,807,392; 7,21 1 ,079; 7,278,068; 7,922,713; 8,382,748; 8.491 .578 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0331621 all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for all purposes. [0006] White both monopolar and bipolar medicai devices are desirable for use in various medical procedures, both have inherent shortcomings, however. For example, monopolar medica! devices are known to pass relatively high electrica! currents through the patient, which may cause unwanted tissue and/or organ damage. Moreover, some procedures cannot ailow the use of monopolar medical devices because of high thermal spread and dispersed energy format. While bipolar medicai devices minimize these shortcomings, accurately controlling which electrode is the active electrode is difficult. [0007] It would therefore be desirable to have a medical device that can address at least one of the aforementioned shortcomings. For example, it would be attractive to have a single e!ectrosurgical medical device that can be used in both monopolar and bipolar modes. It would be desirable to have an electrosurgicai medical device that can be quickly switch between a monopolar mode and a bipolar mode, It would be advantageous to have medical device that can be used in a variety of arrangements in each mode. It would be attractive to have an electrosurgicai medical device that uses less power and voltage, and therefore less current to perform a device function, It would be attractive to have an electrosurgicai medical device with a plurality of electrodes, in which one or more of the electrodes are resistively heated to allow for thermionic disassociation of the electrons : ions, or both so that electrons, ions, or both in a field are accelerated. In this regard, it would be desirable because less voltage may be required to get the same disassociation of the electrons, ions, or both than with only voltage. SUMMARY [0008] The present teachings provide a medical device that addresses at least one of the aforementioned shortcomings. For example, the teachings herein provide a single electrosurgicai medical device that can be used in both monopolar and bipolar modes. The teachings herein also provide an electrosurgicai medicai device that can be quickly switch between a monopolar mode and a bipolar mode. The electrosurgicai medicai device according to the present teachings provide a device that uses less power and voltage, and therefore less current to perform a device function.

The teachings herein provide an electrosurgical medicai device with a plurality of electrodes, in which one or more of the electrodes are resistively heated to allow for thermionic disassociation of the electrons, ions, or both so that electrons, ions, or both in a field are accelerated. In this regard, the present teachings require less voltage to get the same disassociation of the electrons, ions, or both than with only voltage. [0009] The present teachings provide a medical device that includes a hand piece, a heating power supply, and a therapy power supply. The hand piece includes a first electrode including a heater. The heating power supply selectively provides heating power to the heater. The therapy power supply selectively provides therapeutic power to the first electrode. The medical device is changeable between operating a first electrosurgical configuration and a second electrosurgical configuration, in the first electrosurgical configuration, the heating power supply provides the heating power to the heater to heat the first electrode and the therapy power supply provides the therapeutic power to the first electrode. [0010] The present teachings also provide a medicai device, comprising a hand piece, a heating power supply, and a therapy power supply. The hand piece comprises a first electrode including a heater, a second electrode, and a third electrode. The heating power supply selectively supplies heating power to the heater. The therapy power supply selectively provides therapeutic power to the first, second, and/or third electrodes. The medicai device is se!ecfiveiy changeable between a first electrosurgical configuration and a second electrosurgical configuration. In the first electrosurgical configuration, the heating power supply provides the heating power the heater to heat the first electrode and the therapy power supply provides the therapeutic power to the first electrode.

Those skilled in the art may adapt and apply the teachings in its numerous forms, as may be best suited to the requirements of a particular use. Accordingly, the specific embodiments of the present teachings as set forth are not intended as being exhaustive or limiting of the teachings. The scope of the teachings should, therefore, be determined not with reference to the description herein, but should instead be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. The disclosures of all articles and references, including patent applications and publications, are incorporated by reference for all purposes. Other combinations are also possible as will be gleaned from the following claims, which are also hereby incorporated by reference into this written description. [0023] The present teachings relate to a medical device. More specifically, the present teachings relate to a medical device and associated componentry of an electrosurgical medical device. The teachings herein can be applied to any medical device. For example, some non-limiting and exemplary electrosurgical medical devices include forceps, scissors, scalpels, spatulas, J-hooks, graspers, snares, resectoscopes, tweezers, the like, or a combination thereof. The one or more electrosurgical medical devices can be used in one or more arrangements, configurations or modes (i.e., monopolar, bipolar, or both). The electrosurgical medical device may combine one or more thermal, electrosurgical, and mechanical modalities. The electrosurgical medical device may be used in electrosurgery. The electrosurgical medical device can be used in any medical procedure to perform any device function. For example, the medical procedure may be any invasive procedure, minimally invasive procedure, or both. Some non-limiting device functions may include effecting hemostasia; coagulating blood; grasping, manipulating, cutting, transecting, sealing, cauterizing, desiccating, ablating, welding, fulgurating, vaporizing, and/or otherwise effecting an object or any area of the anatomy such as tissue or a vessel. [0024] The electrosurgical medical device can be selectively switched between at least two electrosurgical operating configurations. That is, the electrosurgical medical device can be switched between a first electrosurgical operating configuration and a second electrosurgical operating configuration. In each electrosurgical operating configuration, the electrosurgical medical device can be used in a variety of arrangements and modes. For example, in each operating arrangement or configuration, the electrosurgical medical device can be used in one or more monopolar modes and one or more bipolar modes. The electrosurgical medical device of the present teachings can be easily switched between the various operating arrangements, configurations and modes. More specifically, a surgeon can switch between operating arrangements, configurations and modes before or during a medical procedure without changing devices, without needing a second hand, without disrupting and/or prolonging the medical procedure, or a combination thereof. Such "switchable" electrosurgical medical devices may include an electrosurgical blade, or they may include other features, which may form a medical device that does not include a blade. For example. such "switchable" medical devices may be a forceps, tweezers, segments of a medicai spatula or J-hook, a snare, resectoscope, etc. The electrosurgical medical device may also operate in a single mode; that is, the electrosurgical device may not be switchab!e between at least two electrosurgical operating conditions like in the aforementioned examples. Such "non -switch able" electrosurgical medical devices may include an electrosurgical blade, or they may include other features, which may form a medical device that does not include a blade. For example, such medical devices may be a forceps, tweezers, segments of a medical spatula or J-hook, a snare, resectoscope, etc, [0025] The electrosurgical medical device may include a hand piece. The hand piece may function to provide a gripping or grasping area for handling the electrosurgical medical device. The hand piece may include one or more controls for operating the electrosurgical medical device. For example, the one or more controls may function to control, move, extend, retract, and/or manipulate one or more functional features and/or the one or more extensions to perform a device function during a medical procedure. The one or more controls may also control communication of power and/or signals between the one or more generators and the electrosurgical medical device. That is, in use, the one or more controls may control the type and/or the amount of power, the type and/or amount of signals, or both that are communicated between the one or more generators and the electrosurgical medicai device. In other words, the one or more controls may control whether monopolar or bipolar power is communicated between the one or more generators to the electrosurgical medical device; whether heating power, RF power, or both is communicated between the one or more generators to the electrosurgical medical device; and/or which of the one or more electrodes the power and/or signals are communicated to. Moreover, the one or more controls may control the particular operating arrangement, configuration and/or mode in which the electrosurgical medical device is used. The one or more controls may include one or more knobs, switches, slides, buttons, etc. The hand piece may include one or more connections (i.e., plugs, ports, chords, etc.) for connecting the electrosurgical medical device to one or more generators, to one or more auxiliary devices, or both. [0026] The electrosurgical medical device may include one or more extensions. The one or more extensions may be used to perform a device function in any medical procedure. For example, the one or more extensions may assist effecting hemostasis; coagulating b!ood; grasping, manipulating, cutting, transecting, sealing, cauterizing, desiccating, ablating, welding, fulgurating, vaporizing, and/or otherwise effecting an object or any area of the anatomy such as tissue or a vessel. The one or more extensions may grip, hold, squeeze, manipulate, handle, and/or move any object. The electrosurgicai medical device may comprise any number of extensions. For example, the electrosurgicai medical device may comprise one or more extensions, two or more extensions, preferably three or more extensions, or even four or more extensions. The electrosurgicai medical device may have preferably three of less extensions, two or less extensions, or even one extension. [0027] The one or more extensions may be moveable or immoveable. For example, one or more extensions may be moveable, while one or more extensions may be immobilized. The one or more extensions may be moved or otherwise manipulated via one or more controls on the hand piece, one or more controls at a remote location (i.e., a foot pedal, a remote computer, etc.), or both. The one or more extensions may be moved in any way or direction to perform a device function. For example, one or more extensions may be advanced, extended, retracted, opened, closed, pivoted, rotated, articulated, actuated, reciprocated, clamped, the like, or a combination thereof. The one or more extensions may be axially moved, longitudinally moved, moved along an arc, or a combination thereof. The one or more extensions may be moved individually, together in unison, sequentially, or a combination thereof. The one or more extensions may be moveable or immovable so that the electrosurgicai medical device can be used as any medical device to perform a device function. The one or more extensions may form one or more portions or segments of an arm, jaw, blade, scalpel, or portions of any medical device, such as a snare, forceps, scissors, scalpels, spatulas, J-hooks, graspers, resectoscopes, tweezers, the like, the combination of. One extension may be a center extension, which may be adjacent or sandwiched between two outer extensions (i.e., arranged as a spatula, J-hook. etc.) The one or more extensions may function as a blade, a blade electrode, or both. The one or more blades, blade electrodes, or both may be advanced beyond a distal end of one or more extensions to cut or transect a part of the anatomy, such as a vessel or tissue. The one or more blades, blade electrodes, or both may be advanced beyond a distal end of the one or more extensions to cauterize a vessei or tissue or coagulate b!ood. One or more extensions may move or pivot so that that a vessel tissue, or object can be gripped, grasped, squeezed, manipulated, sealed, held, moved, and/or other wise gripped, [0028] The one or more extensions may comprise or he fabricated from any material. Preferably, the one or more extensions are fabricated from any material that is safe for use in an eiectrosurgical procedure. For example, the one or more extensions may be fabricated from one or more metals, plastics, polymers, elastomers, gold, silver, copper, titanium, aluminum, iron based metals, stainless steel, silicone, po!ytetrafluoroethy!ene (PTFE), insulating polymers, rubber, or a combination thereof, [0029] The one or more extensions may include one or more functional features that may assist in performing a device function. Exemplary and non-limiting functional features may include one or more or various teeth, serrations, mouse teeth, smooth portions, sharp edges, cutouts, notches, wires, scalpels; features or segments of a J- hook; features or segments of a Spatula; features or segments of a snare; features or segments of a forceps; features or segments of a resectoscope; the like, or a combination thereof. [0030] The one or more functional features, extensions, or portions of the one or more functional features or extensions, or a combination thereof, may comprise one or more active portions. The one or more active portions may function to contact a portion of the anatomy to perform a device function thereon or thereto, In other words, the one or more active portions may be in communication with the one or more generators, the one or more electrodes, the one or more extensions, the one or more functional features, or a combination thereof and may function to transmit power, signals, or both to or through the anatomy. The one or more functional features, extensions, or both may include one or more insulating portions. The one or more insulating portions may prevent accidental or inadvertent arching or shorting between adjacent active portions, electrodes, or both. Preferably, each extension, functional feature, or a combination thereof is coated with an insulating material. The one or more extensions may be coated with an insulating material in regions where a user contacts the one or more extensions. The one or more insulating portions may comprise any insulating material. For example, the one or more insulating portions may be such silicone or pol y tetraf luoroeth yle ne . [0031] The electrosurgical medical device may include one or more electrodes. In use, electrical current, power, and/or signals can be communicated between the one or more generators and the one or more electrodes so that a device function can be performed on a site or region of the anatomy with the one or more extensions, functional features, active portions, or a combination thereof. The one or more electrodes may be any conducting instrument, device, or probe. The one or more electrodes may be fabricated from any material that is safe for use in e!ectrosurgery and suitable for performing one or more device functions. The one or more electrodes with a heater may be fabricated from any material, such as Nichrome The one or more electrodes may be in electrical communication with the one or more generators. The one or more electrodes may be in electrical communication with the one or more generators via one or more connections, which may be one or more wires. The one or more electrodes may be in communication with the one or more extensions, active portions, functional features, or a combination thereof. One electrode may be in communication with one extension. Alternatively, more than one electrode can be in communication with a single extension. One or more insulating materials may surround the one or more electrodes to prevent accidental and/or inadvertent arching therebetween. [0032] One or more of the electrodes may include a heater. The heater may be any feature, material, or device that may heat the one or more electrodes. The heater may be provided with electrical power, heating power, therapeutic power, one or more signals, or a combination thereof from any source to resistively heat the one or more electrodes. Preferably, the heater receives heating power from the one or more generators to heat the one or more electrodes with the heater. More preferably, the heater receives heating power from the heating power source. The heater may be, for example, a resistor, a wire, a ferromagnetic materia!, the like, or a combination thereof. The heating power may be constantly supplied to the heater, or the heating power may be selectively supplied to the heater to heat the one or more electrodes. The heating power can be supplied to the heater at any time. In other words, the heating power can be supplied to the heater before therapeutic power is supplied to the electrode, while therapeutic power is being supplied to the electrode, or after therapeutic power has been supplied to the electrode. The heating power can be supplied to the heater to heat the one or more electrodes before or while performing a device function. The heating power can be supplied to the heater via a constant signal, or the heating power can be pulsed, oscillated, or both. The heating power can be supplied to the heater on an "as-needed" basis to maintain the one or more heaters/electrodes at a predetermined and desired temperature; to elevate the one or more heaters/electrodes to a predetermined temperature; to allow the temperature of the one or more electrodes to drop, or a combination thereof, for example. The heating power may be controlled via the hand piece, one or more controls on the hand piece, one or more controls at a remote location (i.e., a foot pedal, a remote computer, etc.), or a combination thereof. The heater may function to provide thermal cutting. [0033] A resistively heated electrode may allow for thermionic disassociation of the electrons, ions, or both. That is, by resistively heating the one or more of the electrodes, electrons, ions, or both in an electrical field are accelerated. Thermionic disassociation may be advantageous because less voltage may be required to get the same disassociation of the electrons, ions, or both than with only voltage. In other words, a greater total energy is possible with lower voltage. Moreover, in a bipolar mode, a heated electrode is more likely to activate as an intended source of therapeutic current (i.e., the active electrode) providing the surgeon with greater control of the location of the intended tissue effect. The one or more electrodes with a heater may be heated even if the one or more electrodes with a heater are not specifically configured or arranged to perform a device function. For example, if one or more other electrode/extension combinations are used to perform a device function (i.e., a second and third extension), the one or more electrodes with a heater (i.e., a first extension) may nonetheless still be heated. Alternatively, the one or more electrodes with a heater may be restricted from being heated in an arrangement or configuration where they are not used to perform a device function. Again, this may be controlled via the hand piece, one or more controls on the hand piece, one or more controls at a remote location (i.e. , a foot pedal, a remote computer), or a combination thereof. [0034] The electrosurgicai medical device may include, or be in communication with, one or more generators. The one or more generators may function to provide power, signals, or both to the e!ectrosurgicai medical device. The one or more generators may function to provide power, signals, or both to the electrosurgicai medica! device so that the electrosurgicai medical device can perform a device function. The device function(s) may include, but are not limited to, any of the examples recited above. The one or more generators may be powered by any energy source or power source. For example, the one or more generators may be powered by AC power, DC power, or a combination of AC and DC power. [0035] The one or more generators may provide any power and/or any signal to the electrosurgicai medical device. For example, the power or signal may be a therapeutic power, a heating power, an RF power, a monopolar power or signal, a bipolar power or signal, an electric signal, an electric current, a voltage, an oscillating eiectrica! energy, or a combination thereof. Preferably, both therapeutic power and heating power is provided by the one or more generators. The one or more generators may include a heating power supply, a therapy power supply, or both. The heating power supply may supply heating power, therapeutic power, or both to the electrosurgicai medical device. The therapy power supply may supply therapeutic power, heating power, or both to the electrosurgicai medical device. The heating power may be the same as the therapeutic power, or may be different. The heating power may be any electrical signal that is communicated to a heater associated with one or more of the electrodes. The heating power may heat the heater and therefore resistive heat the one or more electrodes. The heating power may be an electrical current or signal that remains within the circuit and is restricted or prevented from transferring to a portion of the anatomy. The therapeutic power may be an electrical current or signal that is communicated or transmitted to or through the anatomy to perform a device function thereon. The therapeutic power may be a monopolar signal, a bipolar signal, or both. The monopolar signai may be any signal that has a voltage differentia! between an active port and a return port on the generator. The monopolar signal may be any signal that when applied by the electrosurgicai medical device extends from one pole of an electrode or extension to another pole located at a remote location (i.e., to the patient pad). The monopolar signal may be se!ective!y applied by opening or closing one or more switches or controls on the hand piece; one or more switches or controls extending between the one or more generators and the one or more electrodes (i.e., a foot pad), one or more controls or switches at a remote location (i.e., a remote computer), or a combination thereof. The bipolar signal may be any signal that has a voltage differential between two electrodes connected to the electrosurgical medical device. [0036] The one or more generators may include one or more connections. The one or more connections may be any connection, port, plug, inlet, outlet, etc, for supplying, transmitting, or communicating the power, signals, or both between the one or more generators and the electrosurgical medical device. For example, the one or more connectors may include one or more active ports and one or more return ports that may cooperate to form a closed circuit. The one or more generators may include one or more controls (i.e., switches, buttons, knobs, foot pedals, etc.) so that power, signals, or both can be selectively supplied to the electrosurgical device based on a desired operating mode, arrangement, and/or configuration, for example. The one or more generators may include a central processing unit (CPU), a series of internal switching, or both. The internal switching may provide a signal from an activation circuit to the voltage source so that the voltage source can be supplied to the electrosurgical medical device. The CPU may be interchanged with the internal switching and the switching may perform the same functions as the CPU. The CPU may be any device that supplies power, current, electrical reconfiguration; may be a switch between two or more powers (i.e., heating power, therapeutic power, or both); a switch between two or more arrangements, modes or configurations, or a combination thereof. The CPU may be used to switch the electrosurgical medical device between one or more modes, arrangements, configurations, or a combination thereof. [0037] One or more remote electrodes may be in electrical communication with the one or more generators, the electrosurgical medical device, or both. The one or more remote electrodes may be one or more patient pads. The one or more remote electrodes or patient pads may complete a circuit for the transfer or communication of power, signals, or both between the one or more generators and at least one of the electrodes. The one or more patient pads may be used in a monopolar operating mode. For example, in use, one or more therapeutic signals from the one or more generators may be provided to one or more electrodes, through the anatomy of the patient, and back to the one or more generators via the one or more patient pads. In use, the one or more patient pads may be piaced in at a remote location. For example, the one or more patient pads may be piaced in physical contact, electricai contact, or both with a patient In other words, depending on the type of medical procedure, the one or more patient pads may be in contact with a patient !ying or sitting on the one or more patient pads; in contact with a patient's back; on or around an arm or leg of a patent; in contact with a patient chest; etc. [0038] FIG, 1 illustrates a schematic circuit of an e!ectrosurgical medical device 100. The eiectrosurgical medical device 100 includes a generator 102 and a hand piece 104. The generator 102 includes a heating power supply 108 and a therapy power supply 1 10. The heating power supply 108 provides heating power to the eiectrosurgical medical device 100, and the therapy power supply 1 10 provides therapeutic power to the eiectrosurgical medical device 100. The eiectrosurgical medicai device 100 includes a first electrode 1 12, a second electrode 1 16, and a third electrode 1 18. The first electrode 1 12 includes a heater 114- A remote or patient pad 120 is in electrical communication with the eiectrosurgical medical device 100 and the therapy power supply 1 10. [0039] A first therapeutic power connection 122, which includes a first therapeutic power switch 124, extends between the therapy power supply 1 10 and the first electrode 1 12. A second therapeutic power connection 128, which includes a second therapeutic power switch 128, extends between the therapy power supply 1 10 and the first electrode 1 12. A third therapeutic power connection 130 extends between the therapy power supply 1 10 and the first electrode 1 12. which provides therapeutic power to the first electrode 1 12. When the first therapeutic power switch 122, the second therapeutic power switch 128, or both is open, therapeutic power is restricted from communicating to the first electrode 1 12. However, when at least one of the first and second therapeutic power switches 124, 128 are closed, therapeutic power is provided from the therapy power supply 1 10 to the first electrode 1 12. [0040] A first heating power connection 132 extends between the heating power supply 108 and the heater 1 14 of the first electrode 112. A second heating power connection 134, which includes a heating power switch 136, extends between the heating power supply 108 and the first electrode 112. When the heating power switch 136 is closed, heating power is provided from the heating power source 108 to the heater 1 14 to heat the first electrode 1 12. When the heating power switch 136 is open, heating power is restricted from communicating to the heater 1 14 and, as such, the first electrode 1 12 is not heated. [0041] A fourth therapeutic power connection 138 and a fifth therapeutic power connection 140 extends between the therapy power supply 1 10 and a corresponding second and third electrode 1 16, 1 18. A sixth therapeutic power connection 141 , which includes an electrode switch 142, extends between the therapy power supply 1 10 and third electrode 1 18. A patient pad connection 144 extends between the therapy power supply 1 10 and the remote or patient pad 120. [0042] When at least one of the first and second therapeutic power switches 124, 128 are closed, therapeutic power can be communicated from the therapy power supply 1 10 to the first electrode 1 12 and communicated back to the therapy power supply 1 10 via the second electrode 1 16, the third electrode 1 18, or both (i.e., bipolar mode). Alternatively, the therapeutic power can be communicated back to the therapy power supply 1 10 via the patient pad 120 (monopolar mode). [0043] Moreover, by closing the electrode switch 142. therapeutic power can be communicated from the therapy power supply 1 10 to the third electrode 1 18 and back to the therapy power supply 1 10 via the second electrode 1 16 (bipolar mode). While the therapeutic power is communicated between the second and third electrodes 1 16, 1 18, the therapeutic power, the heating power, or both can be provided to the first electrode 1 12. Alternatively, the heating power switch 136 can be opened to prevent the supply of heating power to the heater 1 14 while therapeutic power is being communicated between the second and third electrodes 1 16, 1 18. Moreover, one of the therapeutic power switches 124, 128 can be opened to prevent the supply of therapeutic power to the first electrode 1 12 while therapeutic power is being communicated between the second and third electrodes 1 16, 1 18. [0044] FIG. 2a illustrates an exemplary electrosurgical medical device 100 in a bipolar operating mode 160. The electrosurgical medical device 100 includes a hand piece 104, a first extension 146, a second extension 148, and a third extension 150. The extensions 146, 148, 150 include at least one function feature 152. The first electrode 112 is in communication with the first extension 146, the second electrode 116 is in communication with the second extension 148, and the third electrode 118 is in communication with the third extension 150. The first extension 146 is longitudinally moveable relative to both the second and third extensions 148, 150. That is, the first extension 146 can be independently moved and extended beyond the second extension 148 and the third extension 150, and can be retracted therebetween. To perform a device function in the bipolar operating mode 160, the electrosurgical medical device 100, and more specifically, the electrodes and the extensions can be used in a variety of arrangements, such as a first arrangement 162, a second arrangement 164, a third arrangement 166, and a fourth arrangement 167. [0045] With reference to FIGS. 1 and 2a, in the first arrangement 162, therapeutic power is provided to the second and third electrodes 116, 118. More specifically, therapeutic power is provided from the therapy power supply 110 to the second electrode 116 via the fourth therapeutic power connection 138. The electrode switch 142 is closed and therapeutic power is provided from the therapy power supply 110 to the third electrode 118. Accordingly, therapeutic power can flow between the second and third electrodes 116, 118.
