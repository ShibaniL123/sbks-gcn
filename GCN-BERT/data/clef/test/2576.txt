Step 2 Synthesis of Compound 123
Compound 122 (8.65 g, 30.1 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (87 mL), under a nitrogen atmosphere, 1.6 mol/L n-butyl lithium in hexane solution at -78°C (19.1 mL, 49 .7 mmol)) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at -78°C. Boric acid triisopropyl ester (14.0 mL, 60.2 mmol) was added dropwise thereto, and the mixture was stirred at -78°C for 1 hour. Saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (100 mL) and 2 mol/L aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (50 mL) were added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (300 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (300 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was washed with hexane to obtain Compound 123 (5.33 g, 70% yield).
