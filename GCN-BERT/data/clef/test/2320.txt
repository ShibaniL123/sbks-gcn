CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2012-0124305 filed on Nov. 5, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND The embodiment relates to a phosphor and a light emitting device having the same. The light emitting device may be included in a lighting system. A LED (Light Emitting Device) is a device having a property of converting electrical energy into light energy. For example, the LED may represent various colors by adjusting the compositional ratio of compound semiconductors. For instance, a nitride semiconductor represents superior thermal stability and wide bandgap energy so that the nitride semiconductor has been spotlighted in the field of optical devices and high-power electronic devices. In particular, blue, green, and UV light emitting devices employing the nitride semiconductor have already been commercialized and extensively used. A LED of emitting white color light, which employs a secondary light source of emitting light by coating phosphor, is generally implemented through a scheme of coating YAG:Ce phosphor of generating yellow color light on a blue LED. However, according to the scheme described above, due to quantum deficits and reradiation efficiency caused by secondary light, the efficiency is degraded and the color rendering is not easy. Thus, since a white LED backlight according to the related art has the combination of a blue LED and a yellow phosphor, the white LED backlight lacks of green and red components, so that colors are unnaturally represented. For this reason, the white LED backlight has been limitedly applied to a display of a cellular phone or a laptop computer. Nevertheless, the white LED backlight according to the related art has been extensively used because the white LED backlight is easily driven and remarkably inexpensive. Generally, it is well known in the art that the phosphor material may include a silicate, a phosphate, an aluminate, or a sulfide and a transition metal or a rare earth metal is used at the center of light emission. For example, although silicate phosphor has been used for a backlight unit or a lighting device, the silicate phosphor is weak to moisture so the reliability of the silicate phosphor is inferior to any other phosphors. Meanwhile, although a phosphor for a white LED, which is excited by an excitation source having high energy such as ultraviolet light or blue light to emit visible light, has been mainly developed, if the phosphor according to the related art is exposed to the excitation source, the luminance of the phosphor is reduced. SUMMARY The embodiment provides a blue phosphor having novel composition and a light emitting device including the same. In addition, the embodiment provides a phosphor having improved reliability and representing high brightness and a light emitting device including the same. In addition, the embodiment provides a phosphor representing high luminescence intensity and a light emitting device including the same. According to the embodiment, there is provided a phosphor expressed by a composition formula of AxOyMCG:RE3+z. The A includes at least one selected from the group consisting of La, Y, Sc, Gd, and Lu, the M includes at least one selected from the group consisting of Si, Ge, and Sn, the C includes at least one selected from the group consisting of B, Al, Ga, and In, the O includes an oxygen element, the G includes a nitrogen element, the RE includes at least one selected from the group consisting of Ce, Sm, Eu, Yb, Dy, Gd, Tm, and Lu, and the x is in a range of 2<x<8, the y is in a range of 3<y<12, and the z is in a range of 0<z<0.75 to emit a central wavelength in the blue light. According to the embodiment, there is provided a light emitting device including a light emitting chip, a phosphor layer on the light emitting chip, and a phosphor added into the phosphor layer to absorb a light emitted from the light emitting chip and emit a central wavelength of a first blue color.

FIG. 7 shows the experimental examples depending on the values of z in phosphors having the composition formula of La6O9Si6Al4N12:Ce3+z. In this case, z is in the range of 0.25≦z≦0.75, and light is emitted with the central wavelength in the range of 465 nm to 475 nm depending on the values of z. In particular, when z is 0.5, experimental example S-9 represents the intensity of 0.9 or more. FIG. 8 is a graph in which the excitation wavelength represents the highest PL intensity at the central wavelength in the range of 300 nm to 400 nm, in detail, the range of 350 nm to 370 nm in La6O9Si6Al4N12:Ce3+z. It can be understood that the blue phosphor of LaxOySi6Al4N12:Ce3+ according to the embodiment uses the excitation wavelength of 400 nm or less, in detail, the excitation wavelength in the range of 350 nm to 370 nm, and represents the highest intensity at the central wavelength in the range of 465 nm to 475 nm. In order to realize a white LED by using the blue phosphor, the blue phosphor according to the embodiment, the red phosphor, and the green phosphor may be applied onto a UV LED chip, or the blue phosphor and the yellow phosphor may be applied onto the UV LED chip. Alternatively, after the blue phosphor is applied onto the UV LED chip, green and red LED chips may be used. Accordingly, the light emission intensity may be improved by using the blue phosphor. FIG. 9 is a flowchart showing a scheme of preparing a phosphor according to the embodiment. Referring to FIG. 9, after measuring source materials such as La2O3, Si3N4,AIN, and CeO2 for the phosphor suitably for the compositional ratio of LaSiA1ON, the source materials are mixed in an agate mortar by using a solvent (step 51). In this case, regarding the compositional ratio of the phosphor, the values of x and y may be changed with the change of the compositional ratio of LaO in the compositional formula of LaxOySi6A14N12:Ce3+z. In the compositional formula, x is in the range of 2<x<8, and y is in the range of 3<y<12. Regarding to the range of z, the intensity of the light emitting wavelength may be changed depending on the range of z. The z may be optimized in the range of 0.25<z<0.75. After the source materials for the phosphor have been mixed, the phosphor is synthesized at a synthetic atmosphere, in which a synthetic temperature is in the range of 1300° C. to 1500° C., and a gas flow rate is in the range of 400 cc to 2000 cc per minute, while changing the ratio of the H2/N2 mixed gas in the range of 5% to 20%/95%-˜80% (step 52). For example, the phosphor may be synthesized at the temperature of 1400° C. for 6 hours with the gas ratio of H2-10%/N2-90% at the gas flow rate corresponding to 1000 cc/minute. The synthesized phosphor is subject to a ball mill process and a washing process by using zirconia and a glass ball, and then subject to a dry process (steps 53 and 54). The dry process is performed for about 24 hours in an oven having the temperature of 100° C. (step 54). The synthesized phosphor is subject to a ball mill process and a washing process by using zirconia and a glass ball, and then subject to a dry process (steps 53 and 54). The dry process is performed for about 24 hours in an oven having the temperature of 100 (step 54). Then, the prepared phosphor may be analyzed in terms of excitation and light emitting characteristics through a PL analysis scheme. The LaSiAlON-based phosphor may be prepared by changing a preparation condition, and the prepared phosphor has the characteristic of a blue phosphor in the central wavelength in the range of about 465 nm to about 463 nm In this case, excited light has a wavelength in the range of 300 nm to 400 nm, and the light emitting wavelength having the maximum intensity is represented at the excitation wavelength in the range of 350 nm to 370 nm. The phosphor may be prepared through a solid phase reaction scheme. In addition, a nitride phosphor or an acid nitride phosphor may be synthesized at the high-temperature and high-pressure condition, and the LaSiAlON-based phosphor may be synthesized even at the low-temperature and low-pressure condition as well as the high-temperature and high-pressure condition. Since the LaSiAlON-based phosphor emits light at a blue region, a UV LED chip and phosphors having red and green regions are used together so that the white light emitting device can be realized. The light emitting device according to the embodiment may be applied to a lighting system. The lighting system has a structure in which plurality of light emitting devices are arrayed. The lighting system may include a display device shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, a lighting device shown in FIG. 12, a lighting lamp, a signal lamp, a headlight of a vehicle, or an electric signboard.
