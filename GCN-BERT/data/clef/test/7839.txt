DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the following detailed description, only certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, simply by way of illustration. As those skilled in the art would realize, the described embodiments may be modified in various different ways, all without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive. Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the specification. With reference to FIG. 1 there is shown a boltless storage rack assembly 10 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The rack assembly 10 comprises right and left end support units 12, each end support unit 12 comprising a front support post 13, a rear support post 14, an upper brace 18, a lower brace 20, and a diagonal brace 22. The upper, lower and diagonal braces 18, 20, 22 are fixedly attached at their ends, preferably by welding, to the front and rear support posts 13 and 14. The front and rear support posts 13 and 14 include at least one column of aligned slots 16 for receiving slot engaging members of cross beams 26, 28. The front and rear support posts 13 and 14 of the end support units 12 may include right and left columns of slots 16. Front cross beams 26 are boltlessly mounted at their ends to the front posts 13 of right and left end support units 12. Rear cross beams 28 are likewise boltlessly mounted at their ends to the rear support posts 14 of the right and left end support units 12 at the same elevations as the front cross beams 26. It is understood that the cross-sectional configuration of the support posts and braces may vary as desired. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the cross-sectional configuration of the posts and braces are generally C-shaped. Likewise the cross-sectional configuration of the cross beams may vary as desired. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the cross beams 26, 28 have cross-sectional configurations as shown in FIG. 1a. Here, the cross beams have a ledge for receiving a shelf panel 32. The cross beams 26 and 28 have an L-shaped flange 29 at each end. A pair of slot engaging members (in this case lances) 30 extend inwardly from the flange 29 to engage wedge-shaped slots 16 in the support posts 13 and 14. The slots 16 and slot engaging members 30 may also vary as desired. For example, in another exemplary embodiment, the slots have a key-hole shape and the slot engaging members are rivets that extend inwardly from the ends of the cross beams. The dimensions of the end support units 12 and cross beams 26 and 28 may also vary. In one embodiment, the end support units 12 are about 3 inches high and about 17 inches deep. In one embodiment, the length of the cross beams is about 39 inches so that the overall width of the rack is about 41 inches. With reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, there is shown a stacked rack assembly 38 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The stacked rack assembly 38 comprises right and left end support assemblies 40, each end support assembly 40 including a pair of end support units 12a, 12b stacked one on top of the other. As illustrated in FIG. 2, when the upper end support units 12a are stacked on top of the lower end support units 12b, the lower braces 20 on the upper end support units 12a abut the upper braces 18 of the lower end support units 12b. Additionally, the lower braces 20 on the upper end support units 12a each include at least one hole 24 aligned with at least one corresponding hole in each of the upper braces 18 of the lower end support units 12b. The upper end support unit 12a is securely mounted to the lower end support unit 12b with connectors 42, e.g., bolts which extend through the holes 24 in the lower brace 20 of the upper end support unit 12a and the aligned holes 24 in the upper brace 18 of the lower end support unit 12b. The bolts 42 are secured with appropriate lock washers and nuts. It is to be understood that any suitable connector may be used. A plurality of front and rear cross beams 26 and 28 are boltlessly mounted to the front and rear support posts 13 and 14 of the end support units 12 that make up the end support assemblies 40. Shelf panels 32 are positioned between and supported at their front and rear edge portions by the front and rear cross beams 26 and 28. As shown, the stacked rack assembly 38 can be anchored at a particular floor location by means of anchors 28 or the like which extend through holes 24 in the lower brace 20 of the lower end support unit 12b and into the floor. The type of anchor will vary depending on the material of the floor. For example, expandable wedge anchors, sleeve anchors, etc., as are well-known in the art may be used with concrete floors, whereas leg bolts or the like may be used for wood floors. Another modular rack assembly 44 according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 4. As shown in this embodiment, the upper and lower end support units 12a and 12b may be secured together by means of front and rear cross beams 26 and 28 wherein the upper slot engaging members 30 at each end of the cross beams engage the lowest slot 16 in the front and rear posts 13 and 14 of the upper end support unit 12a and the lower slot-engaging members 30 of the cross beams engage the uppermost slot 16 of the front and rear post 13 and 14 of the lower end support unit 12b. In this way, seating of the slot-engaging members 30 into the slots 16 secures the upper and lower end-support units 12a and 12b together. Optionally, the upper and lower end support units 12a and 12b may be further secured together by bolts 42 or the like, as described with respect to FIGS. 2 and 3. One of the benefits of the present invention is that a 72-inch high by 17 inch deep by 41 inch wide rack assembly having four pairs of front and rear cross-beams and four shelves may be packaged in a space having the dimensions 39 inches by 17 inches by less than 16 inches. This allows the rack assembly to be packaged in a container that is 40 inches by 18 inches by 16 inches. Such a packaged arrangement provides significant cost savings as compared to racks having 72-inch long side support units. For example, this set of dimensions enables three packages to fit on a standard forty inch by forty-eight inch pallet. An exemplary arrangement of the components for packaging is shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. The end support units 12 may also be used as intermediate support units in larger shelf and/or bench assemblies. For example, FIG. 7 shows another exemplary assembly comprising four end-support units 12 used to form an elongated workbench with three shelf panels 32. FIG. 8 shows another exemplary assembly including left and middle support assemblies 40a, 40b, which each include three stacked end support units 12. The right support assembly 40c includes two stacked end support units 12. Cross-beams 26 and 28 are mounted between the left and middle end-support assemblies 40a and 40b to provide support for four shelf panels 32. Cross-beams 26 and 28 are mounted on and extended between the middle and right support unit assemblies 40b and 40c to provide three shelf panels 32, as shown. FIGS. 9 and 10 show other exemplary assemblies using end support units 12. The present invention also provides work benches that utilize the benefits of the end support units 12 described above. With the reference to FIG. 11, there is provided a work bench 50 with a pair of opposing right and left end support units 12, and front and rear cross-beams 26 and 28 are mounted on and extend between the left and right front and rear support posts 13 and 14 of the right and left end support units 12 at the top of the support posts 13 and 14. For stabilization, a lower rear cross-beam 28 extends, between the rear posts 13 of the right and left end support units 12 at a lower portion of those support posts. A panel 32 is supported at its front and rear edge portions by the upper front and rear cross beams 26 and 28. A cover 52 is mounted over the upper braces 18 of the right and left end support units 12 to create a generally flat surface at about the same level as the top surfaces of shelf panel 32. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cover 52 has the same cross-sectional configuration as the support posts 13, 14 of the end-support units 12, but without the slots. A pair of upright supports 54 extend upwardly from the rearward portion of the end support units 12. In an embodiment of the present invention, the uprights supports 54 are made of the same material and have the same cross-sectional configuration of the support posts 13, 14 of the end-support units 12. The upright supports 54 have a generally horizontal flange 56 at their lower ends. The flange 56 extends forwardly and has a hole that aligns with holes in the cover 52 and upper brace 18 of the end support units 12. The upright supports 54 may be secured to the end support units 12 by connectors, such as bolts as previously described. A cross-beam 58 is mounted at its ends to and extends between top ends of the left and right upright supports 54. In the embodiment shown, there is provided a pegboard assembly 60 which extends between the left and right upright supports 54 and between the top of the workbench 50 and the cross-beam 58 at the upper end of the upright supports 54. The pegboard assembly 60 preferably comprises two pegboard panels 62a and 62b connected together by a plastic strip connector 64 having an H-shaped cross-sectional configuration. Such a connector 64 comprises a pair of grooves or recesses for receiving the lower edge of the upper pegboard panel 62a and the upper edge of a lower pegboard panel 62b. In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 11, the workbench 50 comprises a drawer assembly. Any suitable drawer assembly may be used. Likewise, the workbench 50 could be provided with a lower shelf for storage purposes, if desired. With reference to FIG. 12, there is shown another exemplary workbench constructed according to another embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen, the workbench comprises two workbench assemblies as generally as described in FIG. 11, except that the middle end support unit 12 and upright support 54 provide common support for both workbench units. While the present invention has been described in connection with certain exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements thereof. 1.
