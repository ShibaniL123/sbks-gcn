2-chloro-5-(2-morpholinoethoxy)aniline (1.9 g, 7.4 mmol, 1 eq.) was placed in a mixture of acetone (2.5 mL) and water (3.2 mL) in the presence of K2CO3 (2.1 g, 14.4 mmol, 2 eq.). Cinnamoyl chloride (1.2 g, 7.4 mmol, 1 eq.) was then added at 0Â°C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm-up to room temperature, stirred for 2 hours and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford N-(2-chloro-5-(2-morpholinoethoxy)phenyl)cinnamamide (1.7 g, 60%).
