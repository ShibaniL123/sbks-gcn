[Technical Field] The present invention relates to a halogen-based flame retardant glass fiber reinforced polyamide resin composition and a method of preparing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a halogen-based flame retardant glass fiber reinforced polyamide resin composition comprising a styrene-maleimide based copolymer having a high thermal decomposition temperature to secure flame retardancy and appearance required in electric and electronic components, and a method of preparing the same. [Background Art] Since polyamide resins as one type of engineering plastic have mechanical strength, wear resistance, thermal resistance, chemical resistance, electrical insulation, arc resistance, and the like, they are used in a variety of applications such as vehicles, electric and electronic components, industrial materials, and the like. In particular, when used in electric and electronic components, flame retardancy thereof to prevent fire is considered an important property. Since polyamide resins do not have any inherent flame retardancy, halogen compounds or halogen-free compounds are added thereto or copolymerized therewith, or inorganic compounds or metal hydroxides are added thereto, to provide flame retardancy. Glass fiber reinforced polyamide materials with a halogen-based flame retardant to improve the flame retardancy must secure appearance characteristics when applied to electric and electronic components. However, when a large amount of flame retardant is used to achieve flame retardancy, flame retardant characteristics may be obtained but gas smudges on a surface may be formed. In addition, mechanical properties such as tensile characteristics and the like are deteriorated, thereby causing a variety of limitations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for development of a halogen-based flame retardant glass fiber reinforced polyamide resin composition to resolve the problems. [Disclosure] [Technical Problem] Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is one object of the present invention to provide a halogen-based flame retardant glass fiber reinforced polyamide resin composition, which has flame retardancy and superior appearance, for electric and electronic components to secure mechanical properties such as flame retardancy, superior appearance, tensile strength, and the like while avoiding use of a large amount of conventionally added halogen-based flame retardant by using a styrene-maleimide based copolymer having a high thermal decomposition temperature. [Technical Solution] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, provided is a halogen-based flame retardant glass fiber reinforced polyamide resin composition comprising a styrene-maleimide based copolymer having a thermal decomposition temperature of 300°C or more, as measured with a thermogravimetric analyzer. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, provided is a method of preparing the halogen-based flame retardant glass fiber reinforced polyamide resin, the method comprising twin-screw extruding the halogen-based flame retardant glass fiber reinforced polyamide resin composition at a barrel temperature of 260 to 300°C. [Advantageous effects] As apparent from the foregoing, when a variety of flame retardants are used as a halogen-based flame retardant glass fiber reinforced polyamide resin composition based on a mixed polyamide resin being an engineering plastic type, superior flame retardant characteristics may be secured. However, by newly comprising a compatibilizer having a high thermal decomposition temperature to supplement gas smudge generation on a surface and mechanical properties such as tensile strength and the like, flame retardancy, superior appearance, and mechanical properties such as tensile strength and the like of electric and electronic components prepared using the same while avoiding use of a large amount of conventionally added halogen-based flame retardant may be secured.
