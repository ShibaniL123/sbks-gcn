Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-{5-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl}pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 103)
(103-1) Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-oxo-N'-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzoyl]pyrrolidin-3-carbohydrazide (Compound 103-1)
DMT-MM (262 mg) was added to a solution of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidin-3-carbohydrazide (0.2 g) and 4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzoic acid (0.16 g) in ethanol (10 mL) at room temperature with stirring. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 18 hours. After the reaction completed, the reaction solution was diluted with ethyl acetate (30 mL), and washed with saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (30 mL), followed by saturated brine (30 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to obtain 350 g (yield 99%) of the title compound
