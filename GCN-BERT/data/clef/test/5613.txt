Synthesis of compounds I-062 and I-063
Step 1 Synthesis of compound 62b
The compound 62a (5.0 g, 34.9 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 ml). Diphenyldiazomethane (8.14 g, 41.9 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. Then, the residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography, followed by elution with chloroform/ethyl acetate. Fractions containing the desired compound were concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the compound 62b (5.77 g, 53%).
