184.8: [5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methylsulphanyl-ethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid
5.4 mL (5.4 mmol) of lithium hydroxide monohydrate and 2.8 mL of water are added to a solution of 1.4 g (3.6 mmol) of [5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methylsulphanyl-ethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate in 28 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 h and then hydrolysed and diluted with ethyl acetate. The pH of the aqueous phase is adjusted to acid pH with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid of concentration 1N. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate, the organic phases are combined, washed once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and then concentrated under vacuum. 1.3 g (98%) of [5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methylsulphanyl-ethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid is obtained in the form of a cream-coloured solid.
