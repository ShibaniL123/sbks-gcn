Example 31
Preparation of trans-2,2-dichloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(2-((2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)carbamothioyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide (F2539)
To a solution of trans-2,2-dichloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(hydrazinecarbonyl)phenyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide hydrochloride (F2567) (0.190 g, 0.377 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (4 mL) were added triethylamine (0.114 g, 1.13 mmol) and 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-isothiocyanatoethane (0.064 g, 0.452 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 mL) and washed with water (2×10 mL) and brine (5 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography eluting with 40-60% ethyl acetate/petroleum ether afforded the title compound as an off-white solid (0.08 g, 35%).
