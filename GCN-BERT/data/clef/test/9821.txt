Preparation of trans-5-(3-(3-bromo-4,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-2-chloro-N-(4-fluorophenyl)benzamide (F1005)
Dichloromethane (2 mL) was added to a 20 mL glass vial containing 5-amino-2-chloro-N-(4-fluorophenyl)benzamide (C98) (0.105 g, 0.396 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.053 g, 0.436 mmol), trans-3-(3-bromo-4,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (C29) (0.150 g, 0.396 mmol) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (0.114 g, 0.594 mmol) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 72 hours, concentrated, and purified by silica gel flash column chromatography using 0-100% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent to give the title compound as a yellow foam (0.118 g, 45%).
