CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/524,736, entitled “Medication Dose Preparation and Transfer System” filed Jun. 15, 2012, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/497,855, filed Jun. 16, 2011, the entire contents of each of which are hereby fully incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The subject matter described herein relates to a medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus used for identifying medication within a medication container, measuring an amount of medication withdrawn from the medication container and transferred to a secondary container (e.g. syringe), tracking the amount of medication actually administered to a patient and tracking the amount of any residual medication disposed of as waste. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are a number of patient clinical settings including in-hospital, outpatient and emergency medical services (EMS) that require transfer of medications from original pharmaceutical manufacturer's primary containers to secondary containers to facilitate caregiver administration to patients. When medications are transferred to secondary containers it is standard clinical best practice to label them to reduce the potential for medication errors. However, due to dose measurement mistakes, incorrect transfer of labeling information and other factors, errors continue to occur when caregivers transfer medications from primary containers (vials to syringes) or prepare partial doses (empty syringe withdraws of a partial amount from a primary vial). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, an apparatus for transferring medication from a primary medication container to a manually injectable secondary medication container is provided. The apparatus includes a fluid channel, a primary medication container coupling, a secondary medication coupling, at least one identification sensor and a communications module. The fluid channel terminates at a primary medication container port on a first end and a secondary medication container port on a second end. The primary medication container coupling is configured to fluidically couple the primary medication container to the primary medication container port. The secondary medication container coupling is configured to fluidically couple the secondary medication container to the secondary medication container port. The at least one identification sensor senses (i) an information transfer element on the primary medication container and (ii) an information transfer element on the secondary medication container with the information transfer element on the primary container being used to characterize the medication. The communications module transmits data obtained by and/or derived from the at least one identification sensor to a remote computing system to associate the medication in the primary medication container as having been transferred to the secondary medication container. The primary medication container coupling can include a spike to penetrate a barrier of the primary medication container. The secondary medication container coupling can include a femaleluer fitting to mate with a male luer fitting of the secondary medication container. The primary medication container can be vial with a vial adapter having the information transfer element disposed thereon. The secondary medication container can be a syringe with the information transfer element disposed upon an encoded hub attached to a fluid outlet of the syringe (which in turn is configured to fluidically couple with the secondary medication container port). The communications module can wirelessly transmit data to and/or receive data from the remote computing system. A first identification sensor can sense the information transfer element of a primary medication container and a second identification sensor can sense the information transfer element of the secondary medication container. The information transfer element on at least one of the primary medication container and the secondary medication container can include or be a unique identifier such as a serial number. The at least one flow sensor can characterize an amount of medication passing through the fluid channel such that the communications module transmits data indicating same. In some implementations, the at least one flow sensor can be a bi-directional flow sensor measuring fluid flow in two opposing directions and the data transmitted can separately characterize fluid flow in both opposing directions. Memory can be included that stores data such as data obtained from the at least one identification sensor and/or the at least one flow sensor. At least one data processor (e.g., a CPU/microprocessor, etc.) can process data stored in the memory. A user indicator (e.g., an interface, display, etc.) can be provided that provides visual and/or audio feedback to a user. The indicator can be interactive allowing the user to change one or more operating parameters (e.g., alarm override, enter patient information and the like). The user indicator can display a wide range of information, including but not limited to: medication name, medication category, recommended dosage, secondary medication container fill volume, medication waste volume, secondary medication container identifier, and partial dosage volume. In some implementations, the entire apparatus can be disposable. In other implementations, only a portion of the apparatus is disposable (with the remaining portion being reusable). With this latter arrangement, the fluid channel can be selectively removable to avoid medication cross-contamination and/or sterility issues. With a removable fluid channel, there can be memory within or otherwise coupled to the removable fluid channel. Such memory can have and/or store a unique identifier (e.g., serial number, etc.). The remote computing system can be, for example, one or more of medication management devices and systems, electronic medical records systems, pharmacy management and fulfillment systems, medication storage systems, medication dispensing stations, and medication waste disposal systems. The fluid channel can undertake a variety of geometries. It can be linear, at least partially curved, and angled. With the latter, the fluid channel can have at least one 90 degree angle, and in one implementation, it can have at least two 90 degree angles. The fluid channel can terminate at a patient outlet which can, for example, lead to an IV line for a patient. The fluid channel can include a first sub-channel connecting the primary medication container port with the patient outlet and a second sub-channel extending at an angle from the first sub-channel terminating on one end at the first sub-channel and on a second end at the secondary medication container port. A bi-directional flow sensor can measure the flow of medication in both directions within the second sub-channel as it is transferred to the secondary medication container and as it is expelled from the secondary medication container. With such an arrangement, the communications module can transmit data characterizing the medication flow detected by the bi-direction sensor. At least one check valve can be incorporated to prevent the medication expelled from the secondary medication container from flowing towards the primary medication container port and/or to prevent medication extracted from the primary medication container from flowing back towards the primary medication container port. Removable channel caps can be employed that are secured to the primary medication container port and the secondary medication container port. A housing can be provided through which the fluid channel traverses. Such housing can have a size and shape to allow a user to hold the housing and a primary medication container in a first hand and to operate the manually injectable secondary medication container using a second hand. The fluid channel can include a primary fluid channel terminating at two sub-channels. The two sub-channels can be at an angle in relation to the primary fluid channel and being parallel in relation to each other, the sub-channels respectively terminating in the primary medication container port and the secondary medication container port. A display can be displayed on a housing (i.e., an outer surface of a housing) that envelopes the fluid channel. The communications module can receive data from at least one computing system characterizing the medication, at least a portion of the received data being displayed on the display. It will be appreciated that the communications module can transmit data to a first computing system while receiving data from a second computing system. At least a portion of the information being displayed can include one or more of: information about the fluid transfer process, user guidance, information about the dose to be administered, information about the dose administered to a patient, and patient specific medication administration guidelines or restrictions. The received data can include one or more of: medication delivery order data, patient-specific identifiers, general or medication-specific dosing limits, data for contraindication checking, Broselow color/classification, patient drug allergies, patient weight, medication data, patient specific data, procedural cautionary data, error prevention data, dose time data, physician instructions, drug manufacturer instructions, precautions associated with the medication, and contraindications associated with the medication. The at least one identification sensor can detect the information transfer element using one or more technologies such as optical, magnetic, mechanical, conductive, capacitive, inductive, proximity sensors, infrared, and switchable RFID. In an interrelated aspect, an apparatus for transferring medication from a primary medication container to a manually injectable secondary medication container includes a fluid channel, a primary medication container, a secondary medication container, at least one fluid flow sensor, and a communications module. The fluid channel terminates at a primary medication container port on a first end and a secondary medication container port on a second end. The primary medication container coupling is configured to fluidically couple the primary medication container to the primary medication container port. The secondary medication container coupling is configured to fluidically couple the secondary medication container to the secondary medication container port. The at least one flow sensor to sense medications flowing through the fluid channel. The communications module transmits data obtained by and/or derived from the at least one flow sensor to a remote computing system and, in some implementations, receives data from one or more remote computing systems associated with the medication and/or the patient. Systems can be provided that additionally include a dose preparation and transfer apparatus and one or more of a primary medication container and manually injectable secondary medication container. Kits can be provided that include dose preparation and transfer apparatus as well as one or more of a primary medication container and a manually injectable container. In a further interrelated aspect, a dose preparation and transfer apparatus detects a medication identification code (information transfer element) on a primary medication container, detects an identifier (information transfer element) of a secondary medication container, and transmits data to a remote computing system that characterizes the detected medication identification code and the detected identifier. In some implementations, the dose preparation and transfer apparatus further detects an amount of medication transferred from the primary container to the secondary container and data characterizing same is transmitted to the remote computing system. Apparatus, systems, methods and articles are described to prepare and track medication containers as they are prepared, administered to patients and, in some cases, disposed of. Information such as medication type, concentration, and volume are associated with medication containers during preparation and this information can later be consumed/utilized when administering the medication from a container to a patient. Disposing of any remaining medication can also be tracked (which can be advantageous in connection with controlled substances). In some examples, medication is transferred from a container such as a vial into a syringe and data characterizing the medication is associated with the syringe (e.g., a bar code, a record in a look-up table, etc.). The medication in this syringe can then be injected into a patient via, for example, a medication injection site which can automatically identify the medication container and/or its contents. Any remaining contents of this syringe can be injected into a waste disposal system which can also automatically identify the medication container and/or its contents (and log the container and amount of disposed medication disposed).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a medication dose preparation and transfer system 2. System 2 comprises primary medication container 4, secondary medication container 6, dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 and interconnecting dose transfer fluid channel 10. Fluid channel 10 can include spike 14 for connection to primary medication container 4 and female luer fitting 15 for connection to secondary container 6. Following attachment of container 4 and container 6, fluid from container 4 can be transferred to container 6 through dose transfer channel 10. Information 18 about containers 4 and 6 and the medication transferred through fluid channel 10 can be transmitted (via, for example, a communications module) to recordkeeping system 30 (which may be coupled wirelessly, via a hard-wired communications network, or a combination of both). Recordkeeping system 30 (including healthcare information computing systems) can include one or more of: medication management devices and systems, electronic patient medical records, medication administration records, pharmacy records, medication storage station inventory records, records accounting for the disposal of medication wastes, and the like. A healthcare provider can select vial 4 from an array of available vials and transfer the medication and medication information to a patient's medication injection site for administration. Examples of medication injection sites and related data collection systems are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12/614,276, 12/765,707 and 12/938,300 all entitled “Medication Injection Site and Data Collection System,” the contents of which are hereby fully incorporated by reference. Medication container 4 and secondary container 6 can be joined by a dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 to form medication dose preparation and transfer system 2. Housing 12 can contain hardware, software and mechanical elements for characterizing the transferred medication (e.g., identify and measure amount of transferred medication, determine transfer time, etc.). A dose transfer fluid channel 10 can connect each container (4 and 6) forming a transfer pathway. Fluid channel 10 can be integrated within housing 12 or be separate. When separate, housing 12 is reusable and can be used with many fluid channels 10 that can be made sterile and disposable for single patient use. Disposable flow channel 10 can be sterilized and be part of a kit including a sterile pouch enveloping the disposable sub-housing. Housing 12 and/or fluid channel 10 can be assigned serial numbers for identification which can be read by or received from recordkeeping system 30. One end of fluid channel 10 can have spike 14 to puncture medication container 4 to access the medication for transfer to secondary container (e.g. syringe) 6. The other end of fluid channel 10 can be a female luer type fitting 15 to accept a male luer fitting on secondary container 6. The dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 allows a desired amount of medication in vial 4 to be transferred to a syringe 12 through fluid channel 10. Syringe 6 can initially be provided empty, or in the case of a medication mixture or dilution, can contain an existing volume of fluid. Syringe 6 can be attached to the medication dose preparation and transfer device to withdraw the medication from vial 4. Primary medication container 4's contents can be identified using an information transfer element ID Code 102 (medication name, manufacturer name, drug concentration, NDC code, volume contained, serial number, and other drug or patient specific information) on or associated with primary medication container 4. Secondary medication container 6 can be identified using an information transfer element (ID Code 106). These ID Codes will be described below. FIG. 2 is a diagram describing a detailed view of a medication dose preparation and transfer system 2 as in FIG. 1. At the top of the figure, primary medication container (vial) 4 contains medication 20. At the bottom of vial 4 the open end can be closed by rubber closure and protected by flip off cap. Vial 4 can carry an information source (e.g., medication ID code 102) that provides detectable information indicative of the medication in primary container 4 and/or of the volume of the contents. Primary medication container (Vial) 4 as used herein refers to both vials and other medication containers such as pre-filled syringes and/or bags (except when explicitly disclaimed). It can be appreciated that many configurations of vial 4 can be manufactured and can function in system 2. At the bottom of the figure, secondary container 6 can be a syringe with a syringe body, male luer fitting tip, plunger and plunger rod. It can be appreciated that many configurations of secondary container 12 can be manufactured and can function in system 2. FIG. 2 further illustrates a medication dose preparation and transfer system 2 that comprises medication container adapter (vial adapter) 16 joined with information transfer element (ID Code 102). Vial adapter 16 can be a sterilizable plastic material and can comprise vial spike, spike cover, vial clips, a flow channel and a female luer fitting. It can be appreciated that many configurations of vial adapter 16 can be manufactured and can function in system 2 (provided that the vial adapter can create a sterile fluid pathway between the vial contents and the dose transfer fluid channel 10). Examples of vial adapter devices are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/282,255 entitled “Medication and Identification Information Transfer Apparatus”, the contents of which is hereby fully incorporated by reference. The vial adapter 16 can be a sterilizable injection molded plastic material consisting of element body, fluid inlet, fluid outlet, flow channel and ID Code 102. ID Code 102 can be one or more of an optical source, a magnetic source, a mechanical source, a switchable RFID source, a conductive source, and/or a proximity source. One implementation can provide information encoded within the information element in the form of an optically detectable surface, reflective or absorbing light surface, and can be embedded into or on top of element body. Alternatively, information provided by ID Code 102 can be a magnetically detectable strip similar to a credit card magnetic strip, facilitating a magnetic scan similar to credit card swiping, that is embedded into or on top of the information element body. Further and alternatively, information provided by the information element can be a mechanically detectable feature consisting of Braille like features of bumps or ridges or valleys on the surface of or at the end of element body, facilitating mechanical detection by a micro switch or similar physical detection method. Further and alternatively, information provided by information element can be an RFID tag located on the surface of element body, facilitating detection by an RFID reader. The antenna of the RFID tag can be switchable and can be OPEN prior to connection to the medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8. Upon connection to the dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8, the antenna can become CLOSED (or connected) facilitating RFID reader detection. When the container is disconnected from the dose preparation and transfer apparatus, the RFID tag antenna can again become OPEN. Further and alternatively, information provided by information transfer element ID Code 102 can be in the form of a capacitive or inductive proximity feature on the surface of or embedded into element body, facilitating capacitive or inductive proximity detection. The information element can be an integrated feature of the information transfer element such as etched or molded features. The information element can alternatively be adhered or deposited to the element body (i.e., information element can be a label, etc.) or embedded therein. In addition, the information element can be a separate element that extends around fluid outlet 54. The encapsulated data within ID Code 102 can be formatted using an industry standard representation of the medication being characterized or a proprietary representation of the medication being characterized. The data can include one or more of: an NDC code (National Drug Code), a segment of the NDC code identifying the drug product, a segment of the NDC code identifying the drug package, a unique identifier code, a human readable alphanumeric, a machine readable code, a name of the medication, a manufacturer of the medication, a re-packager of the medication, a distributor of the medication, a strength of the medication, a dosage form of the medication, dose instructions for the medication, administration instructions for a specific patient, medication formulation, medication package form, medication package size, medication contained volume, medication package serial number, medication lot number, and medication expiration date. The encapsulated data can additionally or alternatively also include such information. The ID Code 102 can be applied by any number of operations or steps in the medication supply chain prior to medication administration to a patient including, but not limited to: the original medication manufacturer, a pharmaceutical re-packager, a hospital pharmacy, a compounding pharmacy service, a healthcare professional or caregiver, a patient. Secondary container 6 can be encoded with ID Code 106 to identify the container. ID Code 106 can be a unique number, code, symbol, serial number, random number, or other information describing a specific unique secondary container 6. A medication dose can be transferred from primary container 4 through fluid channel 10 into secondary container 6 by pulling on the plunger rod of syringe 6 and drawing medication dose 22 into it. The ID Code 106 can be applied by any number of operations or steps in the supply chain of secondary container 6 prior to medication transfer including, but not limited to: the original secondary container manufacturer, a pharmaceutical re-packager, a compounding pharmacy service, a hospital pharmacy, a healthcare professional or caregiver, a patient. ID Code 106 can be one or more of an optical source, a magnetic source, a mechanical source, a switchable RFID source, a conductive source, and/or a proximity source. One implementation can provide information encoded within the information element in the form of an optically detectable surface, reflective or absorbing light surface, and can be embedded into or on top of the element body. Alternatively, information provided by ID Code 106 can be a magnetically detectable strip similar to a credit card magnetic strip, facilitating a magnetic scan similar to credit card swiping, that is embedded into or on top of the information element body. Further and alternatively, information provided by the information element can be a mechanically detectable feature consisting of Braille like features of bumps or ridges or valleys on the surface of or at the end of element body, facilitating mechanical detection by a micro switch or similar physical detection method. Further and alternatively, information provided by ID Code 106's information element can be an RFID tag located on the surface of element body, facilitating detection by an RFID reader. The antenna of the RFID tag can be switchable and would be OPEN prior to connection to the medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8. Upon connection to the medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8, the antenna can become CLOSED (or connected) facilitating RFID reader detection. When the container is disconnected from the dose preparation and transfer apparatus, the RFID tag antenna can again become OPEN. Further and alternatively, information provided by ID Code 106's information element can be in the form of a capacitive or inductive proximity feature on the surface of or embedded into element body, facilitating capacitive or inductive proximity detection. ID Code 106's information element can be an integrated feature of the information transfer element such as etched or molded features. The information element can alternatively be adhered or deposited to the element body (i.e., information element can be a label, etc.) or embedded therein. In addition, the information element can be a separate element that extends around fluid outlet. Further, ID Code 106 can be part of an extension or a similar vial adapter adapter 16 that can attach to the fluid outlet of secondary container 6 in a way that once connected becomes permanently or semi-permanently affixed. Dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 can have housing 12 that encloses a power source 115, hardware and software elements 110 and 114. Within apparatus 8 are dose transfer fluid channel 10 (either built-in or separately clipped-in), medication container emitter/detector 104 to detect and transfer ID Code 102 to microprocessor/memory 114, secondary container emitter/detector 108 to detect and transfer ID Code 106 to microprocessor/memory 114 (e.g., a data processor, etc.), volume/flow transducer 118 to monitor and measure fluid transfer, a user indicator 116 can be provided to indicate various steps in the process and provide feedback to the user. Other user indicators can include a display which will be discussed later. When dose transfer fluid channel 10 is separate from dose preparation transfer apparatus 8, fluid channel 10 can be clipped-in in any number of ways to facilitate mating with apparatus 8 for the connection of volume/flow transducer 118 to monitor and measure fluid transfer including, but not limited to: snap fit of fluid channel 10 into a cavity within housing 12, snap fit of fluid channel 10 onto the outside of housing 12, an electrical connector, an inductive connector, an optical connection, etc. Alternately, the separate fluid channel 10 can include volume/flow transducer 118 and/or a memory element 119. The memory element 119 can include any one of calibration data, serial number or other unique information. Dose preparation transfer apparatus 8 can also contain a communications module (sometimes referred to as a wireless radio) 110 for transmission of information 18 to a remote recordkeeping system 30. Recordkeeping system 30 will be discussed later and can be a remote computing system. Information 18 can be bi-directional and can include transfer of data from recordkeeping system 30 (including a medication management system or a healthcare information system) to dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8. Information that can be transferred from record keeping system 30 to dose transfer apparatus 8 includes but is not limited to medication delivery order data, patient-specific identifiers, general or medication-specific dosing limits, data for contraindication checking, Broselow color/classification, patient drug allergies, patient weight, or other information relevant for ensuring the medication being transferred is the right medication and that the resultant dose transferred to secondary container 6 is correct for the intended patient use. FIG. 3 is a diagram describing a detailed view of a second medication dose preparation and transfer system as in FIG. 1. In this variation, medication ID Code 102 can be placed on the closure rim of the primary medication container 4. No vial adapter 16 is needed. Here, medication container emitter/detector 104 can directly identify medication ID Code 102 from primary medication container (vial) 4. The other features and functions of dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 described in FIG. 2 can be the same. FIG. 4 is a diagram describing a detailed view of a third medication dose preparation and transfer system as in FIG. 1. In this variation, medication ID Code 102 is placed on the outlet of a prefilled syringe 4. Here, medication container emitter/detector 104 can directly identify medication ID Code 102 from primary medication container 4 (syringe). The other features and functions of dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 described in FIG. 2 can be the same. FIG. 5 is a diagram describing a detailed view of a fourth medication dose preparation and transfer system as in FIG. 1. In this implementation, medication ID Code 102 can be placed on the closure rim of primary medication container 4 and secondary container (syringe) 6 and located at right angle (or any angle convenient to facilitate use) to the fluid transfer channel 10. Here, medication container emitter/detector 104 can directly identify medication ID Code 102 from primary medication container 4 (vial). Secondary container emitter/detector 108 can identify ID Code 106. Additionally dose transfer fluid channel 10 can form a “T” (or other angled junction). A single direction set of check valves 120 can be located at the junction to control flow through channel 10. When a plunger rod of the secondary container (syringe) 6 is pulled (withdrawn), fluid is removed from primary medication container 4 and passes into syringe 6. The upstream check valve allows flow to the secondary container 6 and the downstream check valve prevents backflow (or air) from the patient outlet 122. Here, a volume/flow bi-directional sensor 118 can measure fluid transfer into the secondary container 6 from vial 4. The secondary container 6 can be removed for administration to a patient as in FIG. 3. Alternately, the entire dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 can be attached to a patient's administration injection port (not shown). In this variation, fluid outlet 122 is attached to the injection port and medication dose 22 is injected by pushing on the syringe plunger rod. Check valves 120 direct flow to the patient. The upstream check valve prevents flow back into primary container 4 and the downstream check valve allows fluid flow to the patient. The other features and functions of dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 described in FIG. 2 are the same. FIG. 6 is a diagram describing the assembly of a medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus with medication containers as in FIG. 1. Primary medication container 4 and secondary medication container 6 can be prepared for use by removing their respective protective caps 22 and 24. Dose fluid transfer channel 10 can be prepared by removing channel cap 26 and spike cap 28. These caps protect the containers and fluid transfer channel 10 when they are provided sterile (fluid path is sterile). Dose preparation apparatus 8 may be held in a first hand and medication container 4 (vial) is held in a second hand. Fluid channel 10's fluid inlet spike 14 can be inserted through a sterile closure stopper in the vial. Secondly, secondary container 6 can be attached to the fluid channel outlet female lure fitting 15 (this can be a slip luer or luer lock type fitting). FIG. 7 is a diagram describing a detailed view of a fifth medication dose preparation and transfer system 2 as in FIG. 1. In this implementation dose transfer fluid channel 10 can be “U” shaped. This can provide for an alternate user configuration where both primary container 4 and secondary container 6 are on the same side of dose preparation apparatus 8. Medication ID Code 102 is placed on the closure rim of the primary medication container 4. Medication container emitter/detector 104 directly identifies medication ID Code 102 from primary medication container (vial) 4. Alternately, fluid transfer channel 10 can be “L” shaped, “J” shaped or otherwise shaped to facilitate use. The other features and functions of dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 described in FIG. 2 can be the same. FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating the assembly of a medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus with medication containers as in FIG. 7. Primary medication container 4 and secondary medication container 6 can be prepared for use by removing their respective protective caps 22 and 24. Dose fluid transfer channel 10 can be prepared by removing channel cap 26 and spike cap 28. These caps protect the containers and fluid transfer channel 10 when they are provided sterile (fluid path is sterile). Dose preparation apparatus 8 may be held in a first hand and medication container 4 (vial) is held in a second hand. Fluid channel 10's fluid inlet spike 14 can be inserted through a sterile closure stopper in the vial. Secondly, secondary container 6 can be attached to the fluid channel outlet female lure fitting 15. The other steps of dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 described in FIG. 6 can be the same. FIG. 9 depicts steps that can be taken in the use of a medication dose preparation and transfer system as in FIG. 3. Step 1: Containers 4 and 6 are prepared for use by removing their protective caps 22 and 24. The dose fluid transfer channel is prepared by removing its caps 26 and 28. Primary container 4 is spiked with the inlet of fluid channel 10 and secondary container 6 is attached to the outlet of fluid channel 10. Step 2: Connection of containers 4 and 6 allow emitter/detectors 104 and 108 to identify and decode ID Codes 102 and 106 respectively. Information 18 is transmitted to recordkeeping system 30. The two ID Codes can be associated with one another in the recordkeeping system 30, along with an amount of medication transferred between the containers and the volume in each medication container following the transfer. Alternatively, ID Codes 102 and 106 can be associated with one another in dose preparation apparatus 8. The assembled dose preparation and transfer apparatus is inverted allowing withdrawal of medication from vial 4. Step 3: Medication is withdrawn from container 4 into container 6 by pulling on the plunger rod of the syringe container (6). Volume/flow sensor 118 measures the transferred medication and the dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 transmits information 19 (volume/flow information) to recordkeeping system 30. The transferred medication dose volume information 19 is associated with ID Code 106 on secondary container 6. The remaining medication in primary container 4 is associated with ID Code 102. Step 4: Secondary container 6 is detached from fluid channel 10 and protective caps 24 and 26 can be replaced to maintain sterility protection. Syringe 6 is then taken to a patient for dose administration. Alternately, vial 4 and vial spike 14 can be detached from fluid channel 10 and syringe 6 with fluid channel 10 still attached can be used to administer medication to a patient (not shown). Step 5: A caregiver can then administer the dose from syringe 6 to a patient by attaching it to medication injection port 200 on a fluid administration tubing set. When attached, ID Code 106 is identified by injection port 200 and that information 21 transmitted to recordkeeping system 30. Recordkeeping system 30 associates the injection with the medication withdrawn in Step 3 and medication type and concentration information (ID Code 102) identified in Step 2. The volume of the dose can be measured by injection port 200 and that information 21 can also be transmitted to recordkeeping system 30 for recording in a patient's medication administration record. Information 21 transmitted to recordkeeping system 30 can be integrated or associated with additional information stored within or accessible by recordkeeping systems 30 and utilized to create paper reports and/or electronic records associated with the medication delivery. The features and functions of medication injection port 200 are described in a medication injection site/medication administration device detailed in the U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12/614,276, 12/765,707, and 12/938,300 all entitled “MEDICATION INJECTION SITE AND DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM”. Features and functions of a sample vial adapter and encoded fluid transfer element are detailed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/768,509 entitled “MEDICATION AND IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION TRANSFER APPARATUS”. The contents of each of the aforementioned applications are hereby fully incorporated by reference. Other medication containers and/or vial adapters and fluid transfer elements may be implemented with this medication dose preparation and transfer system 2. Record keeping system 30 can account for and track medication transfers and administrations to patients in a medication dose history for each patient. Additionally, remaining medication in vial 4 or syringe 6 can be tracked, accounted for and associated with waste disposal. The withdrawn transfer medication volume can be subtracted from the original medication volume in syringe 6 to determine the remaining medication volume. Similarly, the residual medication volume in syringe 6 after dosing and be determined by subtracting the volume of medication delivered to the patient from the total volume of medication that was transferred from vial 4 to syringe 6. The disposed of medication can be tracked by a waste disposal system. For example, a medication wasting device can be configured to receive a syringe 6 containing a controlled substance and bearing an information transfer element ID Code 106 such that the information transfer element is automatically read by the medication wasting device when the syringe is coupled thereto. One example of a medication wasting device is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/170,073 entitled: “Medication Waste Collection Apparatus”, the contents of which are hereby fully incorporated by reference. FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating a medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus as in FIG. 3 with a display. A display 120 can be included on housing 12 of medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8. Display 120 can include a user interface 130 providing information about the fluid transfer process or user guidance to ensure the medication and volume transferred is correct and appropriate for its intended use. For example a pediatric dose preparation system can include the selection of a pediatric color (Broselow color) or patient weight (kilograms or pounds), an indication of the medication type and/or concentration connected identified by ID Code 102 and subsequently recommend a dose or volume for withdrawal from the primary container 4. Pediatric color, patient weight, recommended dose, and other relevant dose preparation parameters can also be downloaded to the medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 from recordkeeping system 30 via information transmission 18. When the secondary container 6 is attached and the syringe plunger rod is pulled a medication dose can be removed from the primary container 4 into secondary container 6. That dose transfer is measured by volume/flow sensor 118 and can be displayed as the syringe fill volume. Subsequently, when the dose is administered to the patient the display can indicate the dose volume. Alternately, the measured volume can be used to calculate a dose in grams, milligrams, micrograms or other medication units instead of milliliters (mL) as shown in FIG. 10. Information 18 can be bi-directionally exchanged and can include transfer of data from recordkeeping system 30 (including medication management devices and systems, or any healthcare information computer system) to dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 for display to a user. Information 18 can provide additional data to the display including, but not limited to medication delivery order data, patient-specific identifiers, general or medication-specific dosing limits, data for contraindication checking, Broselow color/classification, patient drug allergies, patient weight, medication data, patient specific data, procedural cautionary data, error prevention data, dose time data, physician instructions, drug manufacturer's instructions, precautions, contraindications, etc. FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating a second medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus as in FIG. 3 with a display. A display 120 can be included on housing 12 of medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8. Display 120 can include a user interface 130 providing information about the fluid transfer process or user guidance to ensure the medication and volume transferred is correct and appropriate for its intended use. For example a controlled substance dose preparation system can include an indication of the medication type and or concentration connected identified by ID Code 102. A caregiver can determine an appropriate dose volume and withdraw that dose volume from the primary container 4. When the secondary container 6 is attached and the syringe plunger rod is pulled a medication dose is removed from the primary container 4 into secondary container 6. That dose transfer is measured by volume/flow sensor 118 and can be displayed as the syringe fill volume. Subsequently, when the dose is administered to the patient the display can indicate the patient dose volume. Alternately, the entire volume of medication can be withdrawn from vial 4. In this case any extra medication can be disposed of in a waste container prior to dose administration to a patient. In this case the remaining volume is retained in syringe 6 for administration to the patient. Information 18 about the medication (ID Code 102, the withdrawn volume, the disposed of waste volume measured, the unique syringe ID Code 106) can all be transferred to recordkeeping system 30 for tracking and accounting of controlled substances. Dose volumes can be used to calculate a dose in grams, milligrams, micrograms or other medication units instead of milliliters (mL) as shown in FIG. 11. FIG. 12 is a diagram showing an example sequence of operation for the device in FIG. 11. Step 1: A caregiver receives medication orders and prepares the dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 (300, 302, 304, 306). Step 2: A caregiver assembles the medication containers (4 and 6) to medication dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 (308, 310, 312, 314, 316, 318). Step 3: The recordkeeping system 30 maintains a tracking record of ID codes and transfer volumes (320) and the caregiver detaches the secondary container 6 from apparatus 8 (322). Step 4: The caregiver administers the medication to the patient and disposes of unused medication waste (324, 326, 328). The recordkeeping system 30 accounts for the history of medication transferred with from primary medication container 4 to secondary medication container 6, the dose administered to the patient, and any residual waste disposal (330). FIG. 13 is a diagram describing a detailed view of a sixth medication dose preparation and transfer system 2 as in FIG. 1. In this implementation, medication ID Code 102 can be placed on the primary medication container vial 4 (102a) or on vial closure rim (102b) of the primary medication container 4. In FIG. 13, medication container emitter/detector 104 can identify medication ID Code 102 (102a or 102b) on primary medication container (vial) 4 when it is not attached to dose transfer fluid channel 10. Then, after ID Code 102 has been identified by dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 it can be spiked or attached onto fluid channel 10, inverted and prepared for dose transfer into secondary container 6. Secondary container 6 can still have ID Code 106 located at the fluid outlet and can be identified by emitter/detector 108. In this implementation dose transfer fluid channel 10 couples primary medication container 4 to secondary container 6. Housing 12 can contain a volume/flow transducer 118 coupled to dose transfer fluid channel 10 to measure an amount of medication transferred from vial 4 to syringe 6. The other features and functions of dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 described in FIG. 3 can be the same. FIG. 14 is a diagram describing a detailed view of a seventh medication dose preparation and transfer system 2 as in FIG. 1. In this implementation, dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 does not utilize dose transfer fluid channel 10 and instead uses a separate vial adapter 16. Housing 12 can contain identification emitter/detectors 104 and 108 to read ID Codes 102 and 106 respectively. Housing 12 can contain hardware and software elements 110 and 114 to process and transmit or receive information 18 to/from recordkeeping system 30. ID Code 102 can be placed on the primary medication container vial 4 (102a) or on vial closure rim (102b) of the primary medication container 4 as in FIG. 13. Additionally, ID Code 106 can be placed on secondary medication container 6 (106a) or on the syringe fluid outlet (106b) of secondary medication container 6. Emitter/detector 104 can identify ID Code 102 (102a or 102b) on primary medication container (vial) 4 when it is not attached to dose transfer fluid channel 10. Emitter/detector 108 can identify ID Code 106 (106a or 106b) on secondary medication container (syringe) 6 when it is not attached to dose transfer fluid channel 10. Then, after ID Codes 102 and 104 have been identified by dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 they can be associated with each other via information transmission 18 using recordkeeping system 30. When used, primary medication container (vial) 4 is coupled to secondary container (syringe) 6 for fluid transfer. Vial 4 can be coupled (spiked) using medication container adapter 16 attached to the fluid outlet of secondary container (syringe) 6. Adapter 16 can contain dose transfer fluid channel 10. Adapter 16 can be a vial adapter, a needle, a blunt tip cannula, a needle-less luer adapter with spike as shown in FIG. 2 or any fluid transfer apparatus designed to transfer medication 20 from vial 4 into syringe 6. Following the coupling of vial 4 to syringe 6 through dose transfer fluid channel 10, the assembly is inverted and prepared for dose transfer. In this implementation dose transfer fluid channel 10 couples primary medication container 4 to secondary container 6. Measurement of fluid transfer is done by the caregiver and manually entered into recordkeeping system 30. The other features and functions of dose preparation and transfer apparatus 8 described in FIG. 2 can be the same.
