Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromo-2-pyridyl)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-3,6,8,9-tetrahydropyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
(1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-3,5-dimethyl-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (2.21 g, 5.33 mmol) in propionic acid (14.0 mL) was cooled to −20° C. A solution of sodium nitrite (0.40 g, 5.86 mmol) in water (2.8 mL) was added dropwise over 5 minutes, keeping the bath temperature between −20° C. and −15° C. The resulting mixture was stirred at −20° C. for 45 minutes. Toluene (80 mL), cooled to −15° C., was poured into the reaction, and the reaction was stirred for 15 minutes. A solution of sodium carbonate (12.0 g, 113 mmol) in water (125 mL) was slowly added and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. EtOAc (100 mL) was added and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with CHCl3/IPA (3:1) (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product which was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 15 to 50% EtOAc in hexane. Product containing fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (1.63 g, 72%) as a brown solid.
