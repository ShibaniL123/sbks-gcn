Field of the Invention The present invention relates to functionalising reagents and methods of using them for the modification of proteins and polypeptides. The present invention further relates the uses of functionalised polypeptides produced by the methods of the present invention. More specifically, the present invention employs functionalising reagents comprising a nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring which has a vinyl substituent and which is covalently linked to a coupling partner. Typically, the coupling partner is capable of altering properties of the polypeptide such as a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group. Background of the Invention It is known in the art that it is possible to covalently link polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers to therapeutic polypeptides, a process termed pegylation. Pegylation is normally carried out reacting the polypeptide with a reactive derivative of the PEG molecule, typically using a derivative that includes a functional group such as a hydroxyl, a thiol, an amine or a carboxylic acid group. In pegylation reactions, the reactive functional group of the PEG molecule forms a stable covalent bonds with amino, carboxy or thiol groups of amino acids present in the polypeptide, or with the reactive N- or C-termini of the polypeptide. In general, pegylation reactions require the use of a reactive cross-linking reagent such as maleimide. However, it is also known that pegylation is a relatively uncontrolled reaction, mainly as a result of the use of the reactive cross-linker and because the PEG molecules can react in a number of different ways with multiple functional groups present in polypeptides, thereby producing heterogeneous products. This means that the resulting pegylated polypeptides can have linear or branched structures and/or have a variable number of PEG molecules coupled to each polypeptide. The reaction is also influenced by factors such as protein type and concentration, reaction time, temperature and pH value, all of which have an effect on the end products of the reaction. In general, pegylation is carried out to influence the pharmacokinetic or immunological properties of polypeptides, especially those that are intravenously administered. In particular, the polypeptides can be altered to improve their stability, biological half-life, water solubility and immunologic characteristics. It is thought that pegylating a polypeptide to increase its mass (e.g., by 20-50 kDa) means that it is less readily excreted through the kidneys and therefore persists in the body for longer. In addition, pegylated polypeptides are thought to be protected from the degradation by endogenous enzymes, which also helps to increase their in vivo half-life. It is further thought that increasing the in vivo half-life and improving the efficacy of polypeptide drugs can lead to a reduction in the frequency or dose of the polypeptide that a patient requires, and hence help to reduce immune reactions against the polypeptide. Pegylation can also help to improve the water solubility to hydrophobic polypeptides. However, while the properties of pegylated polypeptides are desirable, especially in therapeutic polypeptides, the lack of control in the pegylation reactions remains a problem as it often leads to a range of products having a range of different properties. Moreover, as polypeptides are complex molecules, it is difficult to use protecting groups to control the site and/or extent of the reaction, for example as would be possible in small molecule chemistry. The glycosylation of polypeptides is a natural form of post-translational modification that alters the structure and function of polypeptides. In nature, glycosylation is introduced by an enzymatic process that leads to site specific modification of different types of glycosylated polypeptides. In N-linked glycosylation, glycans are attached to the amide nitrogen of asparagine side chains and in O-linked glycosylation, glycans are attached to the hydroxy oxygen of serine and threonine side chains. Other forms of glycosylation include glycosaminoglycans which are attached to the hydroxy oxygen of serine, glycolipids in which the glycans are attached to ceramide, hyaluronan which is unattached to either protein or lipid, and GPI anchors which link proteins to lipids through glycan linkages. There is a general problem in the art in that glycosylation is often added to polypeptides in eukaryotic cells, but is rarely added to polypeptides expressed in the prokaryotic hosts often used for the recombinant expression of therapeutic polypeptides. This absence of glycosylation in polypeptides produced in prokaryotic hosts can lead to the polypeptides being recognised as foreign or mean that they have the properties that otherwise differ from their native forms. There is also a problem that it is difficult to engineer glycosylation into polypeptides at sites where there is not native glycosylation, in an attempt to use this to modulate the properties of the polypeptides. WO 88/05433 discloses cross-linking reagents for producing conjugates of polypeptides and signal producing or cytotoxic chemical entities. The cross-linking reagents consist of a range of aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, in particular 2-, 3- or 4-vinyl pyridines and vinyl pyrimidines, to which the signal producing or cytotoxic chemical entities can be attached via activated ester substituents present in the cross-linking reagent. The conjugation reaction relies on the vinyl groups of the reagents reacting with thiol groups present in the polypeptides. The compounds disclosed in WO 88/05433 all include an electron withdrawing substituent as a functional group of the aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring. It is also notable that WO 88/05433 does not provide any examples that show the linkage of the signal producing or cytotoxic chemical entities to a polypeptide using the cross-linking reagents. WO 2005/024041 describes a method of mass-tagging proteins in two or more cell populations for use in proteomics methods. The tagging involves reacting cysteine residues in one of the populations with 2-vinylpyridine, and in the other population with a C1-4 alkyl substituted 2-vinylpyridine, thereby producing tagged proteins with masses that are distinguishable by mass spectroscopy. Banas et al (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 957(2): 178-84, 1988) studied the reactivity of cysteine residues of E. coli phosphofructo-1-kinase, using vinyl pyridine, bromopyruvate and dithionitrobenzoic acid to determine the relative reactivity of the six cysteine residues present in the polypeptide. Fullmer (Analytical Biochemistry, 142(2): 336-9, 1984) describes a method of improving the analysis of the amino acid composition of peptides, in particular the identification of cysteine and tryptophan. One of the improvements uses 4-vinyl pyridine to protect half of the cysteine residues present in a peptide after reductive cleavage of disulphide bonds as the cysteine derivatives produced are stable to acid hydrolysis. There remains a problem in the art in improving the derivatisation of polypeptides with coupling partners such as PEG molecules and glycan groups. Summary of the Invention Broadly, the present disclosure relates to compounds and methods of using them for functionalising polypeptides with moieties, such as poly(alkylene glycol) molecules and glycan groups. This chemistry is based on a functionalising reagent which comprises a nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring having a vinyl substituent that is capable of reacting with one or more thiol groups that are naturally present, or have been introduced into, the polypeptide, for example by employing a thiol group of one or more cysteine residues. In general, the functionalising reagent is covalently linked to a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule, or a glycan group so that the reaction between the vinyl group and the thiol group in the polypeptide covalently links the polypeptide to the poly(alkylene glycol) molecule and/or the glycan group. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method which comprises contacting a polypeptide having at least one reactive thiol group with a functionalising reagent which comprises a nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring having a vinyl substituent capable of reacting with the at least one thiol group of the polypeptide, wherein the functionalising reagent is covalently linked to a glycan group, so that the vinyl substituent of the functionalising reagent reacts with the thiol group of the polypeptide, thereby to covalently link glycan group to the polypeptide. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of modifying, e.g. pegylating or glycosylating, a polypeptide having at least one reactive thiol group, the method comprising contacting the polypeptide with a functionalising reagent which comprises a nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring having a vinyl substituent capable of reacting with the at least one thiol group of the polypeptide, wherein the functionalising reagent is covalently linked to a glycan group, so that the vinyl substituent of the functionalising reagent reacts with the thiol group of the polypeptide, thereby to covalently link the glycan group to the polypeptide. The methods of the present invention may involve one or more steps in addition to the step of reacting the functionalising reagent and the polypeptide to link them together. By way of example, the methods may include an initial step of reacting a precursor functionalising reagent comprising a nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring having a vinyl substituent with the glycan group to produce the functionalising reagent. Alternatively or additionally, the method may comprise the initial steps of determining the location of reactive thiol groups in the polypeptide, selecting one or more thiol groups for reaction with a functionalising reagent according to the present invention, and optionally protecting some of the remaining thiol groups. The polypeptide may then be reacted with the functionalising reagent as described herein. It will be appreciated from the above that the reaction of the vinyl group and a thiol group of the polypeptide generally produced a -CH2-CH2-S- group, covalently linking the functionalising reagent and the polypeptide. The thioether bond produced in this reaction is generally very stable under biological conditions. This stability may be contrasted with the prior art use of maleimide as a cross-linking reagent which suffers from the potential disadvantage when used to derivatise a polypeptide that it undergoes reactions such as ring opening on storage. In embodiments of the present invention in which the polypeptide does not include a suitable thiol group, or does not include suitable thiol group in a desired position in the polypeptide chain, the present invention may comprises the initial step of modifying a parent polypeptide, e.g. by chemical reaction or site directed mutagenesis, to produce a variant polypeptide having a thiol group at one or more desired positions of the polypeptide. Preferably, this is done by replacing one or more of the amino acids in the polypeptide with a cysteine residue. In embodiments of the present invention relating to the glycosylation of polypeptides, the parent polypeptide may be modified at a natural glycosylation site, for example at an aspargine, a threonine or a serine residue, to introduce a thiol group that can then react with a functionalising reagent that comprises one or more glycan groups. This may be done, for example, where the parent polypeptide is not glycosylated at this position, for example as a result of the way in which it has been produced, or where glycosylation has been removed. Alternatively or additionally, the methods of the present invention may involve modifying amino acid residues spatially proximal to the reactive thiol group to improve the reactivity of the thiol group towards the functionalising reagent. By way of example, modifications to spatially proximal amino acid residues may be performed to alter local pH, hydrogen bonding interactions, waters of hydration, or steric accessibility around the reactive thiol group. Preferably, the reactive thiol group, whether it is present naturally in the polypeptide or has been introduced, is part of a cysteine amino acid residue. After the method as defined above has been carried out, the pegylated or glycosylated polypeptide may then be purified or isolated in one or more further steps. The present disclosure provides a compound for functionalising a polypeptide with a glycan group represented by the formula: wherein: X and Y are independently selected from CH or N;wherein at least R1, and optionally R2, are covalently linked to a glycan group; wherein: R1, and optionally R2, are independently selected from: -(CH2)n-Z-(CH2)o-R, where Z is O, S or NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-C(O)-Z-(CH2)o-R, Z is O, S or NH, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-(CH2)n-Z-C(O)-(CH2)o-R, where Z is O, S or NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-Y-(CH2)n-Z-C(O)-(CH2)o-R, where Y is an aryl group, O, S or NH, Z is 0 or NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-Y-R, where Y is O or S, R is a hydrogen, a glycan, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule, aryl or C1-10 alkyl;with the proviso that when R2 is not linked to a glycan group, it may additionally be selected from hydrogen or an electron withdrawing group, such as halogen (F, Cl, or Br), -NO2, -CO2H, - CO2R4, COR4, -CHO, -CN, -CF3, -SO2NR4R5, alkyl or phenyl, where R4 and R5 are independently selected from hydrogen or C1-10 alkyl;or R2 and R3 together form a fused (hetero)aromatic ring substituent which may include, but is not limited to, an indole, indazole, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, aziradine or a purine;or R3 is selected from hydrogen or a substituent selected from halo; hydroxy; ether (e.g., C1-7alkoxy); formyl; acyl (e.g., C1-7alkylacyl, C5-20arylacyl); carboxy; ester; acyloxy; amido; acylamido; thioamido; tetrazolyl; amino; nitro; nitroso; azido; cyano; isocyano; cyanato; isocyanato; thiocyano; isothiocyano; thioether (e.g., C1-7alkylthio); sulfonic acid; sulfonate; sulfone; sulfonyloxy; sulfinyloxy; sulfamino; sulfonamino; sulfinamino; sulfamyl; sulfonamido; C1-7alkyl (including, e.g.,unsubstituted C1-7alkyl, C1-7haloalkyl or C1-7hydroxyalkyl, C1-7carboxyalkyl, C1-7aminoalkyl). In some embodiments, for the linkers described above, Y is O or NH, with the other groups as defined above. Additionally or alternatively, the electron withdrawing group is not an alkyl group. Preferably, the nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring is a substituted pyridine ring (X and Y are both CH) or a substituted pyrimidine ring (one of X and Y is CH and the other is N). Preferably, the R1 and/or R2 groups for linking the glycan group to the nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring are independently selected from - (CH2)n-Z-(CH2)o-R or -C(O)-Z-(CH2)o-R, with the substituents as defined above. More preferably, in the R1 and R2 groups, o is zero and the groups may be represented as -(CH2)n-Z-R or -C(O)-Z-R, with the substituents as defined above. By including the possibility that one or two of the groups linked to the nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring may be poly(alkylene glycol) molecule and/or glycan groups, the present invention enables R1 and R2 to both be poly(alkylene glycol) molecules or glycan groups or one to be a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule and one a glycan group, thereby producing mixed functionalising reagents. Preferably, the nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring is a pyridine, pyrimidine or azidine ring. More preferably, the nitrogen containing heterocyclic aromatic ring is a pyridine ring or a pyrimidine ring and most preferably, it is a pyridine ring. When pyridine or pyridimidine rings are employed, preferably the vinyl group is in the 2-position relative to a nitrogen heteroatom. However, in some embodiments, it is possible to employ more extended fused heterocyclic aromatic ring systems such as an indole, indazole, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, aziradine or a purine. Generally, the glycan group is directly covalently bonded to the R1 and/or R2 groups as shown in the formula above. The linking groups may have different lengths to keep the glycan group closer or further away from the polypeptide. The length of the linker may be chosen However, in some embodiments it might be desirable to include an extended linker between the R1 group and the glycan group. Such a linker may be necessary to alter solubility or immunogenic properties of the functionalising group. A preferred class of functionalising reagents according to the present invention may be represented by the following general formula: or wherein: at least R1, and optionally R2, are covalently linked to a glycan group; and further wherein: R1, and optionally R2, are independently selected from: -(CH2)n-Z-(CH2)o-C(O)-R, where Z is S or NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-(CH2)n-Z-(CH2)o-R, where Z is S or NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-C(O)-Z-(CH2)o-R, Z is S or NH, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-(CH2)n-Z-C(O)-(CH2)o-R, where Z is S or NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-Y-(CH2)n-Z-C(O)-(CH2)o-R, where Y is an aryl group, S or NH, Z is NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is a hydrogen, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group; or-Y-R, where Y is S, R is a hydrogen, a glycan, a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule, aryl or C1-10 alkyl;with the proviso that when R2 is not linked to a poly(alkylene glycol) molecule or a glycan group, it may additionally be selected from hydrogen or an electron withdrawing group, such as halogen (F, Cl, or Br), -NO2, -CO2H, -CO2R4, COR4, -CHO,-CN, -CF3, -SO2NR4R5, alkyl or phenyl, where R4 and R5 are independently selected from hydrogen or C1-10 alkyl. In a preferred class of functionalising reagents, R1 is -(CH2)n-Z-(CH2)o-C(O)-R, where Z is S or NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is one or more poly(alkylene glycol) molecules or glycan groups; and/or R2 is a hydrogen, alkyl or -(CH2)n-Z-(CH2)o-C(O)-R, where Z is S or NH, n is 0 to 10, o is 0 to 10 and where R is one or more poly(alkylene glycol) molecules or glycan groups.

Detailed Description Polypeptides The methods of the present invention are generally applicable to a range of applications based on the reaction being capable of specifically and directly introducing functional groups, in particular poly(alkylene glycol) molecules and glycan groups, into polypeptides. The methods described are applicable to any size or type of polypeptide from single amino acids and peptides to polypeptides and proteins having molecular weights of up to or over 100kDa. Accordingly, while for convenience, the methods herein are generally described by reference to "polypeptide", this should be taken to include shorter sequences of amino acids (e.g., from 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 amino acids in length to 30, 40 or 50 amino acids in length), sometimes referred to in the art as peptides. The term should also be taken to include polypeptides having secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure generally referred to as proteins, as well as multidomain proteins. The methods and reagents disclosed herein are particularly useful for functionalising therapeutic polypeptides, for example to modify their pharmacological properties such as stability, biological half-life or water solubility, or the immunologic characteristics of the polypeptide. Example of suitable classes of polypeptides that may be modified in accordance with the present invention include erythropoietins (EPO), interferons, interleukins, chemokines, lymphokines, cytokines, insulin, monoclonal antibodies and fragments, recombinant antibodies and fragments, blood-clotting factors, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), growth hormones, plasminogen activators, virally-derived peptides, reproductive hormones, therapeutic enzymes and carrier proteins (e.g. as used to make conjugate vaccines). Specific examples of polypeptides that may be employed include colony stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Factor VIIa, Factor VIII, Factor IX, human growth hormone (hGH), DNase, insulin, glucagon, VEGF, VEGF receptor, TNF, TNF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), erythropoietin (EPO), enfurvirtide, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-24, interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, interferon alpha-2a, interferon alpha-2b, interferon alpha, or interferon gamma. In the present invention, references to polypeptides that are antibodies includes immunoglobulins whether natural or partly or wholly synthetically produced. The term also covers any polypeptide or protein comprising an antigen binding domain. Antibody fragments which comprise an antigen binding domains include Fab, scFv, Fv, dAb, Fd fragments, diabodies, triabodies or nanobodies. It is possible to take monoclonal and other antibodies and use techniques of recombinant DNA technology to produce other antibodies or chimeric molecules which retain the specificity of the original antibody. Such techniques may involve introducing DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region, or the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), of an antibody to the constant regions, or constant regions plus framework regions, of a different immunoglobulin. See, for instance, EP 0 184 187 A, GB 2,188,638 A or EP 0 239 400 A. Antibodies can be modified in a number of ways and the term should be construed as covering any specific binding member or substance having an antibody antigen-binding domain with the required specificity. Thus, this term covers antibody fragments and derivatives, including any polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin binding domain, whether natural or wholly or partially synthetic. Chimeric molecules comprising an immunoglobulin binding domain, or equivalent, fused to another polypeptide are therefore included. Cloning and expression of chimeric antibodies are described in EP 0 120 694 A and EP 0 125 023 A. It has been shown that fragments of a whole antibody can perform the function of binding antigens. Examples of binding fragments are (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward, E.S. et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989)) which consists of a VH domain; (v) isolated CDR regions; (vi) F(ab')2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al, Science, 242; 423-426, 1988; Huston et al, PNAS USA, 85: 5879-5883, 1988); (viii) bispecific single chain Fv dimers (PCT/US92/09965) and (ix) "diabodies", multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion (WO 94/13804; Holliger et al, P.N.A.S. USA, 90: 6444-6448, 1993). Fv, scFv or diabody molecules may be stabilised by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Reiter et al, Nature Biotech, 14: 1239-1245, 1996). Minibodies comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made (Hu et al, Cancer Res., 56: 3055-3061, 1996). Methods of modifying or functionalising proteins The present invention provides a convenient method for modifying or functionalising a protein of interest using thiol groups that are present in, or have been previously introduced into, the polypeptide, e.g. at one or more cysteine residues. In preferred embodiments, the methods disclosed herein employ reagents and conditions that are well adapted for modifying proteins and other biological materials. In particular, the reaction conditions that are used in the present method helps to avoid the problems that tend to occur when using prior art reagents such as maleimide, which have a tendency to produce a mixture of different products with a range of different properties. As mentioned above, the polypeptide of interest may be modified using existing thiol groups or by introducing thiol groups in an initial step of the method, for example by reacting one or more functional groups of the polypeptide to produce a thiol group, or by introducing a thiol group or a precursor thereof into the polypeptide. By way of example, this may involve the step of introducing a cysteine residue into the polypeptide at a site where it is desired to functionalise the polypeptide. This may be useful in situations where a convenient cysteine residue for reaction according to the present invention is not present in a starting or wild-type polypeptide. Conveniently, this may be achieved using site directed mutagenesis of the polypeptide, the use of which is well established in the art. The present methods are particularly amenable for use in functionalising polypeptides with poly(alkylene glycol) molecules or glycan groups. One preferred use of the methods and reagents of the present invention is for glycosylating a polypeptide of interest with one or more glycan groups. The carbohydrate group may be a naturally occurring or synthetic monosaccharide, oligosaccharide or polysaccharide. This approach can be used to add glycosylation to a protein of interest, or to introduce glycosylation where glycosylation is desired but is not introduced in the course of the production of the protein, e.g. by virtue of the fact that the protein has been produced in bacterial cells or, particularly for peptides, where they have been produced by chemical synthesis. The ability to control glycosylation at defined sites using the present invention represents a useful tool for engineering recombinant proteins, for example therapeutic proteins and antibodies, and fragments thereof, in their manufacture and in controlling their immunogenicity and pharmacological properties such as half life. At present, the manufacture of recombinant protein therapeutics is expensive and slow as mammalian cell lines are often used for manufacture to ensure that the proteins are glycosylated. The methods disclosed herein may be used to add glycosylation to a polypeptide after production in bacterial cell lines, in which expression is generally more efficient, thereby helping to improve the speed and/or economy of protein production, while retaining the glycosylation. Alternatively, for polypeptides expressed in cell lines that glycosylate expression products, the present invention may be used to modify or add glycosylation. In preferred embodiments, the carbohydrates employed may comprise chemically modified derivatives of naturally occurring branched oligosaccharides commonly displayed on N- or O- linked glycoproteins, or degradation products thereof. Carbohydrate groups that may be used in the present invention are well known in the art and include carbohydrate groups found in the N- and O-linked glycosylation of eukaryotic proteins and man made carbohydrate groups, e.g. see the carbohydrate groups and methods of producing and identifying them disclosed in WO 03/025133 and WO2004/083807. N-Linked glycans are found attached to the R-group nitrogen (N) of asparagine in the sequon. The sequon is a Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr sequence, where X is any amino acid except proline and may be composed of N-acetyl galactosamine, galactose, neuraminic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, fructose, mannose, fucose and other monosaccharides. In eukaryotes, N-linked glycans are derived from a core 14-sugar unit assembled in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum. First, two N-acetyl glucosamine residues are attached to dolichol phosphate, a lipid, on the external side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Five mannose residues are then added to this structure. At this point, the partially finished core glycan is flipped across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, so that it is now located within the reticular lumen. Assembly then continues within the endoplasmic reticulum, with the addition of four more mannose residues. Finally, three glucose residues are added to this structure. Following full assembly, the glycan is transferred en bloc by the glycosyltransferase oligosaccharyltransferase to a nascent peptide chain, within the reticular lumen. This core structure of N-linked glycans thus consists of 14 residues (3 glucose, 9 mannose, and 2 N-acetylglucosamine). In eukaryotes, O-linked glycans, are assembled one sugar at a time on a serine or threonine residue of a peptide chain in the Golgi apparatus. Unlike with N-linked glycans, there is as of yet no known consensus sequence. However, the placement of a proline residue at either -1 or +3 relative to the serine or threonine is favourable for O-linked glycosylation. The first monosaccharide attached in the synthesis of O-linked glycans is N-acetyl-galactosamine. After this, several different pathways are possible. A Core 1 structure is generated by the addition of galactose. A Core 2 structure is generated by the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine to the N-acetyl-galactosamine of the Core 1 structure. Core 3 structures are generated by the addition of a single N-acetyl-glucosamine to the original N-acetyl-galactosamine. Core 4 structures are generated by the addition of a second N-acetly-glucosamine to the Core 3 structure. Other core structures are possible, though are less common. A common structural theme in O-linked glycans is the addition of polylactosamine units to the various core structures. These are formed by the repetitive addition of galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine units. Polylactosamine chains on O-linked glycans are often capped by the addition of a sialic acid residue (similar to neuraminic acid). If a fucose residue is also added, to the next to penultimate residue, a sialyl-lewis-X (SLex)) structure is formed. The methods of the present invention may also be used to make conjugate vaccines, e.g. conjugate vaccines formed by linking one or more antigen molecules to a carrier protein, thereby conferring the immunological characteristics of the carrier protein on the antigen molecule. This approach is often used where the antigen molecule is a glycan group (e.g. an antigenic polysaccharide) as they tend to be comparatively poor antigens. The methods disclosed herein allow multiple antigen molecules to be attached to the carrier protein, preferably at one position on the protein carrier, through the use of the functionalising reagents of the present invention. Examples of conjugate vaccines include: Haemephilus influenzae type B vaccines ("Hib vaccine"), in which a Hib polysaccharide is conjugated to a protein carrier such as tetanospasmin, mutant diphtheria protein or meningococcal group B outer membrane protein; meningococcoal conjugates vaccines in which one or more meningococcal meningitis serogroup polysaccharides (e.g. A, C, Y or W-135) are conjugated to a protein carrier; pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPSV) in which the polysaccharides are cell membrane sugars from the different serotypes of pneumococcus (e.g. 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) conjugated with a carrier protein such as a Diphtheria proteins. The protein and polysaccharide components of any of the vaccines described above may be linked using the functionalising reagents of the present invention. The methods disclosed herein can also be employed to engineer proteins containing other moieties useful for modifying the pharmacological properties of therapeutic proteins. One preferred example is the conjugation of polypeptides to poly(alkylene glycol) molecules, in particular polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules, that may be used to enhance the half life or other pharmacological properties of polypeptide therapeutics. The present methods provide the opportunity to pegylate proteins of interest in a selective way depending on where the thiol groups are present in the protein. Poly(alkylene glycol) molecules are interchangeably referred to in the art as poly(alkylene oxide) molecules and are polyethers. Poly(alkylene glycol) molecules may have linear, branched, comb or star structures and generally are highly water soluble. In addition, the basic poly(alkylene glycol) structure may be provided with one or more reactive functional groups such as hydroxy, amine, carboxylic acid, alkyl halide or thiol groups to facilitate the reaction of the poly(alkylene glycol) molecule with other species such as polypeptides. Preferred poly(alkylene glycol) molecules include those substituted at one or more hydroxyl positions with a chemical group, such as an alkyl group having between one and four carbon atoms. The most preferred poly(alkylene glycol) molecules for use in accordance with the present invention are polyethylene glycol ("PEG") molecules, although the skilled person would be able to use the techniques disclosed herein in conjunction with other poly(alkylene glycol) molecules, such as polypropylene glycol or polyethylene-polypropylene glycol copolymers. Poly(alkylene glycol) molecules, including PEGs, typically have molecular weights between about 400Da and about 80kDa, more preferably between about 1kDa and about 60kDa, and more preferably between about 5kDa and about 50kDa, e.g. molecular weights of 10kDa, 20kDa, 30kDa or 40kDa. Poly(alkylene glycol) molecules that may be used in accordance with the present invention are well known in the art and publicly available, for example from commercially available sources such as SigmaAldrich. Pegylation is a known strategy for modifying the properties of therapeutic polypeptides, such as peptides, proteins and antibodies. In general, the attachment of PEG molecules to polypeptides is used to alter their conformation, electrostatic or hydrophobic properties, and lead to improvements in their biological and pharmacological properties, such as increasing drug solubility, reducing dosage frequency, modulating (especially increasing) circulating half-life, increasing drug stability and increasing resistance to proteolytic degradation Pegylation works by increasing the molecular weight of the therapeutic polypeptide by conjugating the polypeptide to one or more PEG polymer molecules. The methods of the present invention have the advantage that the site of introduction of the PEG molecules into a polypeptide is defined by the presence of thiol groups. Examples The following examples are set forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to practice the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

Labelling of human recombinant IFN-beta with vinylpyridine-PEG derivative versus maleimide-PEG A reaction was carried out to compare labelling of the polypeptide interferon beta with a PEG-pyridine conjugate according to the present invention and the use of PEG and the prior art cross-linking agent maleimide. Recombinant interferon beta (C17S, D80N) reacted with PEG-pyridine or PEG Maleimide. Human interferon beta-1, fibroblast (Origene Technologies) mutated at C17S to remove endogenous free cysteine and D80C to replace endogenous glycosylation site by site directed mutagenesis (Stragene Quickchange). Recombinant interferon beta reduced with 0.1 mM TECP for 12 h followed by reaction with PEG/pyridine or PEG/maleimide at time point specified in diagram at pH 7.5, 37°C. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE and were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with anti-interferon b antibody for unreacted and Pegylated IFNb. Secondary antibody reaction detected using ECL detection system (Amershan, GE Healthcare). In both cases, the PEG molecule had a molecular weight of 5kD. The results are shown in Figure 2 and show that the use of the conjugate of the present invention coupled an average of one PEG-conjugate to the interferon beta, with molecular weight increasing from approx. 20kD to 25kD, increasing over reaction time. In contrast, the reaction with maleimide was significantly less specific and led to the conjugation of multiple PEG molecules to the interferon beta. Effect of pH on rate of labelling of BSA with Vinylpyridine-5k-PEG pH dependence of bovine serum albumin (Sigma) functionalized with 5kD PEG/pyridine was investigated. BSA reduced with 1 mM DTT at 4 °C for 12 h followed by reaction with 5kD PEG/pyridine at room temperature at the time indicated. Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Commassie blue for visualization. The results in Figure 3 were obtained at pH 5.5 and 7.5 and show that the conjugation reaction proceeds at both pHs, but is faster at pH 7.5. This has been confirmed in other experiments that show that the reaction can be used over a wide range of pH, including the range of physiological pH relevant to protein biochemistry. The results also show that pH may be used to control the rate of the conjugation reaction. Temperature dependence of 5kD PEG/pyridine reaction with recombinant IFN beta (C17S, N80C). IFN beta mutant was treated with 5mM 5kDa PEG vinyl pyridine reagent at pH 7, at temperatures indicated. Aliquots were taken at time points indicated and the reaction quenched by addition of DTT. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE and were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with anti-interferon beta antibody for unreacted and Pegylated IFN-beta. Secondary antibody reaction detected using ECL detection system (Amershan, GE Healthcare). The results are presented in Figure 4. Protein Functionalisation Reactions Reaction Conditions The protein was diluted (5 mg/ml) in deoxygenated reaction buffer (NaC2H3O, 20 mM, pH 5.5) and reduced under nitrogen for 3 hours with either tris-(carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, 5 mM) or β-mercaptoethylamine (BMEA, 5 mM). Excess reducing agent was subsequently removed either by three rounds of ultrafiltration (Milipore centricons 10 kDa cut-off) or two rounds of dialysis (cellulose acetate membrane, 6 - 8 kDa cut-off). A 10-fold solution of PEG in the reaction buffer was prepared and added to the protein solution to give the reaction mixture containing protein (1 mg/ml) plus is to 5 molar equivalents of PEG as required. The mixture was incubated in a sealed tube overnight (37 °C). FPLC The reaction mixture was diluted 5 to 10-fold with 10 mM NaC2H3O, pH 4.5. The sample was loaded onto a SP-sepharose cation exchange column pre-equilibrated with 3 column volumes of binding buffer (10 mM NaC2H3O, pH 4.5). After being washed to remove the nonbound fractions (3 column volumes of binding buffer) the protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient (50-200 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaC2H3O, pH 4.5), and 1.5 mL fractions were collected. Fractions containing the protein were analysed by gel electrophoresis. SDS PAGE analysis The degree of PEGylation of the protein was assessed by gel electrophoresis. Typically protein samples (1-10 µg) were diluted with loading dye containing 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and boiled for 3 minutes to denature prior to loading onto a NUPAGE BisTris'4-12 % gel (Invitrogen). Coomassie Stain was used to detect protein (blue) and Dragendorff (iodobismuthate) to visualize polyethylene glycols (orange-brown). Functionalisation of model protein with PermaLink A model protein, Bacillus circulans xylanase (S22C) mutant (BcxS22C), was chosen to illustrate how polypeptides can be functionalized with glycan or PEG molecules in accordance with the present invention using the Permalink functionalising reagents. Details of the experiments are set out in Figure 5 which shows: (A) Structure of PL-LK-07. (B) A solution of BcxS22C (5 mg/ml) in deoxygenated sodium acetate buffer (20 mM, pH 5.5) was reduced for 3 hours with tris-(carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, 5 mM). Excess reducing agent was subsequently removed by three rounds of ultrafiltration (Milipore centricons 10 kDa cut-off). The PEG (1.5 eq) was added to the protein solution (1 mg/ml) and incubated overnight (37 °C). PEGylated protein was recovered from the reaction mixture via liquid chromatography using a sepharose SP cation exchange column. The sample was diluted five-fold and loaded onto the column pre-equilibrated in binding buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5). The product was eluted with a linear salt gradient (50 - 200 mM NaCl in binding buffer) and 1.5 ml fractions were collected. (C) Fractions containing protein as depicted by UV absorbance at 280 nm were analysed by SDS PAGE. This shows that vinylpyridine compounds are effective reagents for the attachment of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) to cysteine residues of proteins, and that the products of such reactions can be obtained in high purity. Specificity of the functionalising reagent for thethiol groups of cysteine residues As one of the disadvantages of maleimide based linker chemistry is a lack of reaction specificity, the functionalising reagents of the present invention were tested to determine their specificity for cysteine residues and the results are reported in Figure 6. To gauge the specificity of the linker for cysteine residues a sample of wild type Bcx with no cysteines present was used. This protein was first reduced with tris-(carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, 5 mM) in sodium acetate buffer (20 mM, pH 5.5) for 3 hours. After this time any remaining reducing agent was removed by three rounds of ultrafiltration (Milipore centricons 10 kDa cut-off). The resulting concentrated protein solution was diluted to 1.2 mg/ml in the relevant buffer (50 mM, citrate buffer pH3, acetate buffer pH6, tris buffer pH9). A solution of the PEG (5 eq) was added to the protein to give a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The reactions were incubated overnight (16 hours, 37°C). The amount of PEGylated product was calculated by running reaction samples on a 4 - 12 % SDS PAGE. This shows that vinylpyridine reagents display greater specificity towards the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues over other amino acids, compared to maleimide reagents.
