Step 2. (R)-6-Chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carbonitrile
To a solution of (R)-6-chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine-3-carboxamide (Example 23, step 1, 4.5 g, 12.2 mmol) in dichloromethane (30 mL) at room temperature under argon was added methyl N-(triethylammoniumsulfonyl)carbamate (Burgess reagent, 4.3 g, 18.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 d. The mixture was absorbed onto silica gel and purified by column chromatography (5% to 20% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give the title compound (3.68 g, 88% yield) as a sticky colorless solid.
