TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an adhesive composition containing a polyolefinic polymer and an adhesive tape using the same. BACKGROUND ART Protect films or adhesives containing a polyolefinic material as a base material are inexpensive, and therefore have been variously studied in the past. For example, PTL 1 discloses a protect film produced by mixing a liquid polybutene or a polyisobutylene as a tackifier with an ethylenic polymer. Further, PTL 2 discloses an adhesive tape composed of an olefin polymer and an adhesive resin. CITATION LIST Patent Literature PTL 1: JP-B 6-4729 PTL 2: JP-T 2011-519989 SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem However, with respect to a conventional adhesive increased in the adhesive strength, residual glue was left when a base material was peeled off, and therefore, it was difficult to reuse the adhesive tape, and the holding strength of the adhesive was low. Further, when the addition amount of a tackifier or the like was increased for increasing the adhesive strength, the holding strength was lacking, and thus, the balance between the adhesive strength and the holding strength was not sufficient.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Polyolefin of the Present Invention (Crystalline Polyolefin) The polyolefin of the present invention is a polyolefin which satisfies the following conditions (a-1), (b1), and (b2). In the present invention, hereinafter, this polyolefin is also referred to as “crystalline polyolefin of the present invention”. (a-1) The relationship between the limiting viscosity and the stereoregularity is represented by formula (i). [in-line-formulae]−20×η+56≦mmmm≦−20×η+64 formula (i)[/in-line-formulae] (In the formula, η represents the limiting viscosity measured in tetralin at 135° C., and mmmm represents the meso pentad fraction (mol %).) (b1) The meso pentad fraction (mmmm) is from 20 to 60 mol %. (b2) The limiting viscosity [η] measured in tetralin at 135° C. is from 0.01 to 2.0 dL/g. Since the polyolefin of the present invention satisfies the following conditions (a-1), (b1), and (b2), when the polyolefin is used in an adhesive composition, separation of an adhesive component or an amorphous component is not caused, and less residual glue is left. Further, the polyolefin of the present invention itself does not have adhesive strength, however, by using an amorphous polyolefin in combination, an adhesive composition having a favorable balance of adhesive strength, residual glue, and holding strength can be provided. Further, even if an amorphous polyolefin is not used in combination, by using a tackifier in combination, an adhesive composition having a favorable balance between holding strength and residual glue can be provided. The “holding strength” in the present invention refers to withstanding strength when a static load is applied to a portion of a tape bonded to an adherend in the longitudinal direction of the tape. There was no material which can be highly mixed with an amorphous polyolefin among conventional low-crystalline polypropylenes, and due to this, stickiness, deterioration of transparency, and the like were observed. On the other hand, the polyolefin of the present invention is completely compatible also with an amorphous polyolefin by controlling the stereoregularity although it is a crystalline resin. Accordingly, an adhesive composition containing the polyolefin of the present invention can sufficiently prevent residual glue from being left. (a-1) Relationship Between Limiting Viscosity and Stereoregularity In the case where the limiting viscosity η of the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention is low, the adhesive strength is increased, but residual glue is likely to be left, and therefore, the meso pentad fraction mmmm is preferably higher. On the other hand, in the case where the limiting viscosity η is high, the adhesive strength is decreased, but residual glue is less likely to be left, and therefore, the meso pentad fraction mmmm is preferably lower. Accordingly, the relationship between the limiting viscosity and the stereoregularity of the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention is required to satisfy the above formula (i). The relationship between the limiting viscosity and the stereoregularity of the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention preferably satisfies the following formula (ii) from the viewpoint of adhesiveness and compatibility with an amorphous polyolefin. [in-line-formulae]−20×η+58≦mmmm≦−20×η+60 formula (ii)[/in-line-formulae] (In the formula, η represents the limiting viscosity measured in tetralin at 135° C., and mmmm represents the meso pentad fraction (mol %).) (b1) Meso Pentad Fraction (mmmm) In the case where the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention is a homopolymer, from the viewpoint that an adhesive composition using the polyolefin of the present invention leaves less residual glue, the meso pentad fraction (mmmm) thereof is from 20 to 60 mol %, preferably from 40 to 58 mol %, more preferably from 48 to 56 mol %. The measurement method of the meso pentad fraction (mmmm) will be described below. (b2) Limiting Viscosity [η] From the viewpoint that an adhesive composition using the polyolefin of the present invention leaves less residual glue, the limiting viscosity [η] of the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention is from 0.01 to 2.0 dL/g, preferably from 0.1 to 1.0 dL/g, more preferably from 0.1 to 0.6 dL/g, further more preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 dL/g. Here, the limiting viscosity is measured in tetralin at 135° C. using an Ubbelohde type viscosity tube. In the case where coating is carried out after melting the composition by heating such as hot-melt coating or calender coating, if the composition contains a high-melting point polyolefin, it is necessary to raise the temperature to high when coating is carried out, and therefore, coating cannot be carried out in some cases depending on a base material. Further, a high-melting point polyolefin is hardly dissolved in a solvent such as toluene, and therefore, a problem that the concentration cannot be increased in the case of carrying out solvent casting or the like may occur. Further, if the melting point or the melting endothermic amount ΔH is low, the holding strength becomes insufficient, and also residual glue is left. Due to this, in consideration of the balance between the viewpoint of the coatability and the viewpoint of the holding strength and residual glue, the melting point of the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention is preferably 20° C. or higher and 160° C. or lower, more preferably 20° C. or higher and 140° C. or lower, further more preferably 20° C. or higher and 120° C. or lower, 80° C. or higher and 120° C. or lower. Further, also from the same viewpoints, the melting endothermic amount ΔH of the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention is preferably 5 J/g or more and 100 J/g or less, more preferably 10 J/g or more and 100 J/g or less, further more preferably 10 J/g or more and 90 J/g or less. The melting point Tm and the melting endothermic amount ΔH are measured by the methods described in Examples. Further, the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention preferably satisfies the following (b3) and (b4). (b3) The racemic pentad fraction (rrrr) and (1-mmmm) satisfy the following relationship. [in-line-formulae][(rrrr)/(1-mmmm)]≦0.1[/in-line-formulae] (b4) The amount (W25) of a component eluted at 25° C. or lower by temperature rising chromatography is from 20 to 100% by mass. (b3) Relationship Between Racemic Pentad Fraction (rrrr) and (1-mmmm) From the viewpoint of the residual glue, the following relationship between the racemic pentad fraction (rrrr) of the crystalline polyolefin (2) to be used in the adhesive composition of the first embodiment of the present invention and (1-mmmm):(rrrr)/(1-mmmm) is preferably 0.1 or less, more preferably 0.06 or less, further more preferably 0.04 or less. Here, (rrrr) and (mmmm) are calculated not as a numerical value in the unit of mol %, but as a common proportion. (b4) Amount (W25) of Component Eluted at 25° C. or Lower The amount (W25) of a component eluted at 25° C. or lower by temperature rising chromatography of the crystalline polyolefin (2) to be used in the adhesive composition of the first embodiment of the present invention is preferably from 20 to 100% by mass, more preferably from 30 to 100% by mass, further more preferably from 50 to 100% by mass, particularly preferably from 60 to 100% by mass. W25 is the amount (% by mass) of a component which is eluted without being adsorbed on a filler when the TREF column temperature is 25° C. in an elution curve obtained based on measurement by temperature rising chromatography. W25 is an index indicating whether the polyolefin is a flexible polyolefin or not. A larger value of W25 indicates that a component having a low elastic modulus is increased, and/or the non-uniformity of stereoregularity distribution extends. The crystalline polyolefin of the present invention is not particularly limited, but is preferably a polymer of an olefin having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably a polymer of an α-olefin having 3 to 12 carbon atoms. The crystalline polyolefin of the present invention may be a copolymer, but is preferably a 1-butene homopolymer or a propylene homopolymer, and particularly preferably a propylene homopolymer. (Production Method for Crystalline Polyolefin of the Present Invention) Examples of the production method for the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention include a production method for a propylene homopolymer or a 1-butene homopolymer by homopolymerization of propylene or 1-butene using a metallocene catalyst and a production method for a 1-butene-propylene copolymer by copolymerization of 1-butene and propylene (further an α-olefin having 5 to 20 carbon atoms to be used as needed) using a metallocene catalyst. The crystallinity of the polyolefin to be obtained can be controlled by appropriately selecting the catalyst or adjusting the monomer concentration. Examples of the method for controlling the molecular weight of the polymer include selection of the type of the respective catalyst components, the use amount, or the polymerization temperature, and polymerization in the presence of hydrogen. For example, the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention can be obtained under the polymerization conditions shown in Examples of the present invention. In the present invention, among the metallocene catalysts, a case where a catalyst is composed of a transition metal compound in which a ligand forms a crosslinked structure through a crosslinking group is preferred, and above all, a method using a metallocene catalyst obtained by combining a transition metal compound, in which a crosslinked structure is formed through two crosslinking groups, with a promoter is more preferred.

Examples of the method include (i) a method in which an organic aluminum compound is dissolved in an organic solvent, and then the resulting solution is brought into contact with water, (ii) a method in which an organic aluminum compound is first added when carrying out polymerization, and then water is added thereto, (iii) a method in which an organic aluminum compound is reacted with crystal water contained in a metal salt or the like, or water adsorbed on an inorganic substance or an organic substance, and (iv) a method in which trialkylaluminum is reacted with tetraalkyldialuminoxane and the reaction product is further reacted with water. The aluminoxane may be an aluminoxane which is insoluble in toluene. Among these aluminoxanes, one type may be used or two or more types may be used in combination. The use proportion of the catalyst component (A) to the catalyst component (B) is in the range of preferably 10:1 to 1:100, more preferably 2:1 to 1:10 in terms of molar ratio when the compound (B-1) is used as the catalyst component (B), and when it deviates from the above range, the catalyst cost per unit mass of the polymer increases, so that it is not practical. When the compound (B-2) is used, the use proportion is in the range of preferably 1:1 to 1:1,000,000, more preferably 1:10 to 1:10,000 in terms of molar ratio. When it deviates from the above range, the catalyst cost per unit mass of the polymer increases, so that it is not practical. Further, as the catalyst component (B), (B-1) and (B-2) can be used alone or two or more types can be used in combination. In the polymerization catalyst in the above production method, an organic aluminum compound as a component (C) can be used in addition to the component (A) and the component (B) described above. Here, as the organic aluminum compound serving as the component (C), a compound represented by the general formula (VII) is used: [in-line-formulae]R16vAlJ3-v (VII)[/in-line-formulae] wherein R16 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, J represents a hydrogen atom, an alkoxy group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, or a halogen atom, and v is an integer of 1 to 3.

Among these organic aluminum compounds, one type may be used or two or more types may be used in combination. In the production method, preliminary contact can also be carried out using the component (A), the component (B), and the component (C) described above. The preliminary contact can be carried out by, for example, bringing the component (B) into contact with the component (A), but the method is not particularly limited, and a known method can be used. This preliminary contact is effective in the reduction in the catalyst cost due to the improvement of the catalyst activity, the reduction in the use proportion of the component (B) which is a promoter. Further, by bringing the component (A) into contact with the component (B-2), an effect of improving the molecular weight can be seen in addition to the effect described above. The preliminary contact temperature is usually −20° C. to 200° C., preferably −10° C. to 150° C., more preferably 0° C. to 80° C. In the preliminary contact, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, an aromatic hydrocarbon, or the like can be used as an inert hydrocarbon serving as a solvent. Among these, an aliphatic hydrocarbon is particularly preferred. The use proportion of the catalyst component (A) to the catalyst component (C) is in the range of preferably 1:1 to 1:10,000, more preferably 1:5 to 1:2,000, further more preferably 1:10 to 1:1,000 in terms of molar ratio. By using the catalyst component (C), the polymerization activity per transition metal can be improved, however, if the amount thereof is too much, the organic aluminum compound is not only wasted, but also remains in a large amount in the polymer, and therefore the excessive amount thereof is not preferred. In the present invention, at least one of the catalyst components can be carried on a suitable carrier and used. The type of the carrier is not particularly limited, and any of an inorganic oxide carrier, an inorganic carrier other than the inorganic oxide carrier, and an organic carrier can be used. However, in particular, an inorganic oxide carrier or an inorganic carrier other than the inorganic oxide carrier is preferred. Specific examples of the inorganic oxide carrier include SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, ZrO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, B2O3, CaO, ZnO, BaO, ThO2, and mixtures thereof such as silica alumina, zeolite, ferrite, and glass fiber. Among these, SiO2 and Al2O3 are particularly preferred. The inorganic oxide carrier described above may contain a small amount of a carbonate, a nitrate, a sulfate, or the like. On the other hand, examples of the carrier other than the inorganic oxide carrier described above include magnesium compounds represented by the general formula: MgR17xX1y typified by MgCl2, Mg(OC2H5)2, and the like, and complex salts thereof. Here, R17 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or an aryl group having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, X1 represents a halogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, x is 0 to 2, y is 0 to 2, and x+y=2. The respective R17's or the respective X1's may be the same as or different from each other. Further, examples of the organic carrier include polymers such as polystyrene, styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, polyethylene, poly(1-butene), substituted polystyrene, and polyallylate, as well as starch and carbon. As the carrier to be used in the production method described above, MgCl2, MgCl(OC2H5), Mg(OC2H5)2, SiO2, Al2O3, and the like are preferred. The properties of the carrier vary depending on the type thereof and the production method, however, the average particle diameter is usually from 1 to 300 μm, preferably from 10 to 200 μm, more preferably from 20 to 100 μm. If the particle diameter is small, a fine powder in the polymer increases, and if the particle diameter is large, a coarse particle in the polymer increases to cause a reduction in the bulk density or the clogging of a hopper. The carrier has a specific surface area of usually 1 to 1,000 m2/g, preferably 50 to 500 m2/g, and a pore volume of usually 0.1 to 5 cm3/g, preferably 0.3 to 3 cm3/g. If either of the specific surface area and the pore volume deviates from the above range, the catalyst activity decreases in some cases. The specific surface area and the pore volume can be determined from the volume of adsorbed nitrogen gas according to, for example, a BET method. Further, in the case where the carrier is an inorganic oxide carrier, the carrier is preferably used after it is fired at usually 150 to 1,000° C., preferably 200 to 800° C. In the case where at least one of the catalyst components is carried on the carrier described above, it is desired to carry at least one of the catalyst component (A) and the catalyst component (B), preferably both of the catalyst component (A) and the catalyst component (B) on the carrier. The method for carrying at least one of the component (A) and the component (B) on the carrier is not particularly limited, however, for example, (i) a method in which at least one of the component (A) and the component (B) is mixed with the carrier, (ii) a method in which the carrier is treated with an organic aluminum compound or a halogen-containing silicon compound, and then at least one of the component (A) and the component (B) is mixed therewith in an inert solvent, (iii) a method in which the carrier, the component (A) and/or the component (B), and an organic aluminum compound or a halogen-containing silicon compound are reacted with one another, (iv) a method in which the component (A) or the component (B) is carried on the carrier, and then the component (B) or the component (A) is mixed therewith, (v) a method in which a catalytic reaction product of the component (A) and the component (B) is mixed with the carrier, (vi) a method in which the carrier is allowed to coexist in the catalytic reaction of the component (A) and the component (B), or the like can be used. In the reactions in the above (iv), (v), and (vi), it is also possible to add the organic aluminum compound as the component (C). In the present invention, the catalyst may be prepared by irradiating an elastic wave when the components (A), (B), and (C) described above are brought into contact. As the elastic wave, generally a sonic wave, particularly preferably an ultrasonic wave can be used. To be specific, an ultrasonic wave with a frequency of 1 to 1,000 kHz, preferably an ultrasonic wave with a frequency of 10 to 500 kHz can be used. The catalyst thus obtained may be used for polymerization after the solvent is evaporated off and the catalyst in the form of a solid is taken out or may be used for polymerization as it is. Further, in the present invention, the catalyst can be produced by performing an operation of carrying at least one of the component (A) and the component (B) on the carrier in the polymerization system. For example, a method in which at least one of the component (A) and the component (B) and the carrier and, if necessary, the organic aluminum compound as the component (C) are added, and an olefin such as ethylene is added at an atmospheric pressure to 2 MPa (gauge) to carry out preliminary polymerization at −20 to 200° C. for about one minute to two hours, thereby forming catalyst particles can be used. In the present invention, it is desired that the use proportion of the component (B-1) to the carrier is preferably from 1:5 to 1:10,000, more preferably from 1:10 to 1:500 in terms of mass ratio, and the use proportion of the component (B-2) to the carrier is preferably from 1:0.5 to 1:1,000, more preferably from 1:1 to 1:50 in terms of mass ratio. In the case where two or more components as the components (B) are mixed and used, the use proportion of each of the components (B) to the carrier is desirably in the above range in terms of mass ratio. Further, it is desired that the use proportion of the component (A) to the carrier is preferably from 1:5 to 1:10,000, more preferably from 1:10 to 1:500 in terms of mass ratio. If the use proportion of the component (B) [the component (B-1) or the component (B-2)] to the carrier or the use proportion of the component (A) to the carrier deviates from the above range, the activity decreases in some cases. The thus prepared polymerization catalyst of the present invention has an average particle diameter of usually 2 to 200 μm, preferably 10 to 150 μm, particularly preferably 20 to 100 μm, and has a specific surface area of usually 20 to 1000 m2/g, preferably 50 to 500 m2/g. If the average particle diameter is less than 2 μm, a fine powder in the polymer increases in some cases, and if the average particle diameter exceeds 200 μm, a coarse particle in the polymer increases in some cases. If the specific surface area is less than 20 m2/g, the activity decreases in some cases, and if the specific surface area exceeds 1,000 m2/g, the bulk density of the polymer decreases in some cases. Further, in the catalyst of the present invention, the amount of the transition metal in 100 g of the carrier is usually from 0.05 to 10 g, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 2 g. If the amount of the transition metal is outside of the above range, the activity decreases in some cases. An industrially advantageous polymer having a high bulk density and an excellent particle size distribution can be obtained by carrying the catalyst on the carrier in the manner described above. As the crystalline polyolefin to be used in the present invention, by using the polymerization catalyst described above, a propylene homopolymer or a 1-butene homopolymer can be produced by homopolymerization of propylene or 1-butene, or a 1-butene-propylene copolymer can be produced by copolymerization of 1-butene and propylene. In this case, the polymerization method is not particularly limited, and any method such as a slurry polymerization method, a gas-phase polymerization method, a bulk polymerization method, a solution polymerization method, or a suspension polymerization method may be used, however, a slurry polymerization method and a gas-phase polymerization method are particularly preferred. With respect to the polymerization conditions, the polymerization temperature is usually from −100 to 250° C., preferably from −50 to 200° C., more preferably from 0 to 130° C. With respect to the use proportion of the catalyst to the reaction starting material, the starting material monomer/the component (A) described above (molar ratio) is preferably from 105 to 108, particularly preferably from 106 to 107. The polymerization time is usually from 5 minutes to 10 hours, and the reaction pressure is preferably from an atmospheric pressure to 3 MPa (gauge), more preferably from an atmospheric pressure to 2 MPa (gauge). Examples of the method for controlling the molecular weight of the polymer include selection of the type of the respective catalyst components, the use amount, or the polymerization temperature, and polymerization in the presence of hydrogen. In the case of using a polymerization solvent, for example, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, or ethylbenzene, an alicyclic hydrocarbon such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, or methylcyclohexane, an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane, heptane, or octane, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or dichloromethane, or the like can be used. Among these solvents, one type may be used alone or two or more types may be used in combination. Further, a monomer such as an α-olefin may be used as the solvent. The polymerization can be carried out without using a solvent depending on the polymerization method. In the polymerization, preliminary polymerization can be carried out using the polymerization catalyst described above. The preliminary polymerization can be carried out by bringing, for example, a small amount of an olefin into contact with the solid catalyst component. However, the method is not particularly limited, and a known method can be used. The olefin to be used for the preliminary polymerization is not particularly limited, and for example, ethylene, an α-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, a mixture thereof, or the like can be used. However, it is advantageous to use the same olefin as used in the polymerization. The preliminary polymerization temperature is usually from −20 to 200° C., preferably from −10 to 130° C., more preferably from 0 to 80° C. In the preliminary polymerization, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, an aromatic hydrocarbon, a monomer, or the like can be used as a solvent. Among these, an aliphatic hydrocarbon is particularly preferred. The preliminary polymerization may be carried out without using a solvent. In the preliminary polymerization, it is desired to control the conditions so that the limiting viscosity [η](measured in decalin at 135° C.) of the preliminary polymerization product is 0.2 dL/g or more, particularly 0.5 dL/g or more, and the amount of the preliminary polymerization product per millimole of the transition metal component in the catalyst is from 1 to 10,000 g, particularly from 10 to 1,000 g. <Adhesive Composition> The crystalline polyolefin of the present invention can be applied to an adhesive composition. The polyolefin of the present invention itself does not have adhesive strength, however, by using an amorphous polyolefin or a tackifier in combination, an adhesive composition can be formed, and an adhesive composition having a favorable balance between holding strength and residual glue can be provided. From the viewpoint of the exhibition of adhesive strength and tackiness, the content of the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention in the adhesive composition of the present invention is 5% by mass or more and 95% by mass or less, preferably 10% by mass or more and 90% by mass or less, more preferably 15% by mass or more and 80% by mass or less, further more preferably 20% by mass or more and 70% by mass or less, still further more preferably 25% by mass or more and 55% by mass or less. [Amorphous Polyolefin] The adhesive composition of the present invention preferably contains the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention and a specific amorphous polyolefin. The amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention preferably has a melting point (Tm) which is lower than 20° C. or is not observed by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and has a melting endothermic amount (ΔH) of less than 5 J/g. The melting point Tm and the melting endothermic amount ΔH are measured by the methods described in Examples. In the present invention, the phrase “the melting point is not observed by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)” refers to that the crystal melting peak cannot be practically observed because the crystallization rate is very slow in the DSC measurement or the crystallization does not occur at all. Incidentally, it is often the case that when the melting point is not observed, also the ΔH cannot be practically observed. Also in the case where the ΔH cannot be observed, the ΔH is regarded as less than 5 J/g. That is, the ΔH is not observed or is less than 5 J/g. If the content of the amorphous polyolefin in the adhesive composition of the present invention is too high, the adhesive strength and tackiness are increased, but the holding strength is decreased and also residual glue is left, while on the other hand, if the content of the amorphous polyolefin is too low, the holding strength is increased and also less residual glue is left, but the adhesive strength and tackiness are decreased. Due to this, from the viewpoint of the balance of adhesive strength, tackiness, holding strength, and less residual glue, the content of the amorphous polyolefin in the adhesive composition of the present invention is preferably 5% by mass or more and 95% by mass or less, more preferably 10% by mass or more and 90% by mass or less, further more preferably 20% by mass or more and 85% by mass or less, still further more preferably 30% by mass or more and 80% by mass or less, yet still further more preferably 45% by mass or more and 75% by mass or less. The amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention is not particularly limited, but is preferably a polymer of an olefin having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably a polymer of an α-olefin having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, further more preferably at least one member selected from the group consisting of a 1-butene homopolymer, a propylene homopolymer, and a 1-butene-propylene copolymer. From the viewpoint of the improvement of the adhesive strength at low temperatures, it is preferred to use a 1-butene homopolymer having a lower glass transition temperature Tg than a propylene homopolymer. The amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention preferably satisfies the following (a1) to (a5): (a1) the meso pentad fraction (mmmm) is from 3 to 40 mol %, or the meso diad fraction (m) is from 30 to 95 mol %; (a2) the sum of the 1,3-bond fraction and the 1,4-bond fraction is less than 0.3 mol %; (a3) the 2,1-bond fraction is less than 0.3 mol %; (a4) the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) as measured by the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) method is 4.0 or less; and (a5) the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) as measured by the GPC method is from 5,000 to 1,000,000. In the present invention, the meso pentad fraction (mmmm), the meso diad fraction (m), the 1,3-bond fraction, the 1,4-bond fraction, and the 2,1-bond fraction are determined in accordance with the methods proposed in “Polymer Journal, 16, 717 (1984)” reported by Asakura et al., in “Macromol. Chem. Phys., C29, 201 (1989)” reported by J. Randall et al., and in “Macromol. Chem. Phys., 198, 1257 (1997)” reported by V. Busico et al. That is, in the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, the signals for a methylene group and a methine group are read, and the meso pentad fraction (mmmm), the meso diad fraction (m), the 1,3-bond fraction, the 1,4-bond fraction, and the 2,1-bond fraction in the polyolefin chain are determined.

Further, in the case where the amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention is a 1-butene-propylene copolymer, from the viewpoint of the balance between the heat resistance and the adhesiveness, the meso diad fraction (m) thereof is preferably from 30 to 95 mol %, more preferably from 40 to 90 mol %, further more preferably from 50 to 85 mol %. The 1-butene-propylene copolymer in the present invention refers to a copolymer in which the sum of the copolymerization ratio of a propylene unit and the copolymerization ratio of a 1-butene unit is 50 mol % or more, preferably 70 mol % or more, more preferably 90 mol % or more. Other than propylene and 1-butene, ethylene or an α-olefin having 5 or more carbon atoms (preferably an α-olefin having 5 to 20 carbon atoms) may be contained as a comonomer. Specific examples of the α-olefin to be used as a comonomer include dienes such as pentene-1, heptene-1, hexene-1, heptene-1, octene-1, decene-1, 1,4-methylpentene-1, 3-methylbutene-1, 1,3-butadiene, hexadiene, pentadiene, heptadiene, and octadiene. The 1-butene-propylene copolymer is preferably a random copolymer. Further, the 1-butene-propylene copolymer contains a structural unit obtained from 1-butene preferably at 15 mol % or more, more preferably at 50 mol % or more, particularly preferably at 75 mol % or more. In the case where the 1-butene unit is contained at 15 mol % or more, the low-temperature properties of an adhesive containing the copolymer are improved. From the viewpoint of the low-temperature properties, it is preferred to contain a larger amount of a structural unit obtained from 1-butene in the copolymer. The respective structural units in the 1-butene-propylene copolymer can be calculated as follows based on the results of the above-mentioned measurement of the 13C-NMR spectrum. [Diad Chain Strength] a (propylene-propylene chain): value of integral at 48.0 to 46.2 ppm b (propylene-butene chain): value of integral at 44.4 to 43.0 ppm c (butene-butene chain): value of integral at 40.8 to 39.8 ppm [Diad Chain Fraction (mol %)] d (propylene-propylene chain fraction)=a/(a+b+c)×100 (mol %) e (propylene-butene chain fraction)=b/(a+b+c)×100 (mol %) f (butene-butene chain fraction)=c/(a+b+c)×100 (mol %) [Copolymerization Ratio (mol %)] propylene unit copolymerization ratio=d+e/2 1-butene unit copolymerization ratio=f+e/2 Further, the meso diad fraction (m) can be calculated according to the following formula based on the results of the above-mentioned measurement of the 13C-NMR spectrum. [in-line-formulae]Meso diad fraction (m)=(value of integral at 40.4 to 39.9 ppm)/(value of integral at 40.4 to 39.9 ppm+value of integral at 40.7 to 40.4 ppm)[/in-line-formulae] (a2) 1,3-Bond Fraction and 1,4-Bond Fraction The sum of the 1,3-bond fraction and the 1,4-bond fraction of the amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention is preferably less than 0.3 mol %, more preferably less than 0.1 mol %, further more preferably 0 mol %. When the sum is within the above range, the fluidity at low temperatures becomes favorable, so that the low-temperature adhesiveness is improved and also the compatibility with a tackifier becomes favorable. The “sum of the 1,3-bond fraction and the 1,4-bond fraction” means the 1,3-bond fraction in the case where the amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention is a propylene homopolymer, and means the 1,4-bond fraction in the case where the amorphous polyolefin is a 1-butene homopolymer, and means the sum of the 1,3-bond fraction and the 1,4-bond fraction in the case where the amorphous polyolefin is a propylene-1-butene copolymer. The control of the 1,3-bond fraction and the 1,4-bond fraction is carried out by the structure of a main catalyst and the polymerization conditions in the same manner as the control of the 2,1-bond fraction to be mentioned below. (a3) 2,1-Bond Fraction The 2,1-bond fraction of the amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention is preferably less than 0.3 mol %, more preferably less than 0.1 mol %, further more preferably 0 mol %. When the 2,1-bond fraction is within the above range, the fluidity at low temperatures becomes favorable, so that the low-temperature adhesiveness is improved and also the compatibility with a tackifier becomes favorable. The control of the 2,1-bond fraction is carried out by the structure of a main catalyst and the polymerization conditions. Specifically, the structure of a main catalyst has a great influence, and by making a space where a monomer is inserted around the central metal of the main catalyst narrower, the 2,1-bond can be controlled, while on the other hand, by making the space wider, the 2,1-bond can be increased. For example, a catalyst called half-metallocene type catalyst has a wide space for insertion around the central metal, and therefore, a structure such as a 2,1-bond or a long-chain branch is easily formed. If a racemic metallocene catalyst is used, the 2,1-bond can be expected to be controlled, however, when a racemic catalyst is used, the stereoregularity is increased, and thus, it is difficult to obtain an amorphous polymer as shown in the present invention. For example, even in the case of a racemic catalyst to be mentioned below, by introducing a substituent into a double-crosslinked metallocene catalyst at the 3-position to control a space for insertion at the central metal, a polymer which is amorphous and has a very low 2,1-bond content can be obtained. (a4) Molecular Weight Distribution (Mw/Mn) The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of the amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention as measured by the GPC method is preferably 4 or less, more preferably 3.5 or less, further more preferably 3.0 or less. When the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) is 4 or less, less residual glue is left when the amorphous polyolefin is used as the starting material of an adhesive. (a5) Weight-Average Molecular Weight (Mw) The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the amorphous polyolefin to be used in the present invention as measured by the GPC method is preferably from 5,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from 9,000 to 200,000, further more preferably from 20,000 to 100,000. When the Mw is 5,000 or more, stickiness is reduced. Further, when the Mw is 1,000,000 or less, the fluidity is improved and the moldability (coatability) becomes favorable. The above-mentioned weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and the number-average molecular weight (Mn) are a weight-average molecular weight and a number-average molecular weight in terms of polystyrene measured using the following device under the following conditions. The above-mentioned molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) is a value calculated from the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and the number-average molecular weight (Mn). <GPC Measuring Device> Column: TOSO GMHHR-H(S)HT Detector: RI detector for liquid chromatography, Waters 150 C <Measurement Conditions> Solvent: 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene Measurement temperature: 145° C.

The adhesive composition of the present invention has a storage elastic modulus (E′) at 25° C. obtained from the solid viscoelasticity measurement of the composition of 1 MPa or more and 200 MPa or less. A higher elastic modulus indicates a harder material. If the storage elastic modulus E′ at 25° C. (around room temperature) is too low, the holding strength is lacking and also residual glue is left, while on the other hand, if the storage elastic modulus is too high, the adhesive strength and tackiness are lacking. Here, 25° C. is a temperature when the adhesive composition is used as an adhesive tape, and if the adhesive composition is too hard at this temperature, the adhesive tape is not adhered, and therefore, in the present invention, the adhesive composition is required to be a soft material having a storage elastic modulus E′ of 200 MPa or less. On the other hand, if the adhesive composition is too soft, residual glue is left, and therefore, in the present invention, the adhesive composition is required to be a moderately soft material having a storage elastic modulus E′ of 1 MPa or more. From this point of view, the storage elastic modulus at 25° C. of the adhesive composition is preferably 3 MPa or more and 100 MPa or less, more preferably 5 MPa or more and 80 MPa or less. (Storage Elastic Modulus at 50° C.) The adhesive composition of the present invention has a storage elastic modulus (E′) at 50° C. obtained from the solid viscoelasticity measurement of the composition of 1 MPa or more and 100 MPa or less. If the storage elastic modulus E′ at 50° C. (high temperature) is too low, the holding strength at high temperatures is lacking and also residual glue is left, while on the other hand, if the storage elastic modulus is too high, the adhesive strength and tackiness are lacking. Here, 50° C. is a temperature which the adhesive composition should withstand as an adhesive tape, and the adhesive composition is required to be moderately soft at this temperature. From this point of view, the storage elastic modulus at 50° C. of the adhesive composition is preferably 1 MPa or more and 80 MPa or less, more preferably 3 MPa or more and 60 MPa or less. Ideally, it is preferred that the storage elastic modulus at 25° C. is comparable to the storage elastic modulus at 50° C., and the storage elastic modulus does not vary in any temperature range. The solid viscoelasticity measurement in the present invention is carried out by the following method. The measurement is carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere under the following conditions using a viscoelasticity measuring device (manufactured by SII Nano Technology, Inc., trade name: DMS 6100 (EXSTAR 6000)). (Measurement Conditions) Measurement mode: tensile mode Measurement temperature: the measurement is carried out at the following two temperatures: 25° C. and 50° C. in the range from −150° C. to 230° C. Temperature rising rate: 5° C./min Measurement frequency: 1 Hz Sample size: length: 10 mm, width: 4 mm, thickness: 1 mm (press-molded product) (Use) The adhesive composition of the present invention can be preferably used for an adhesive tape and a protect film. <Adhesive Tape> The adhesive tape of the present invention is configured such that the adhesive composition described above is used in an adhesive layer. The adhesive composition may be directly coated onto a support, or may be painted on an auxiliary support and transferred onto a final support. The material of the support is not particularly limited, but for example, a fabric, a knit, a scrim, a non-woven cloth, a laminate, a net, a film, a paper, a tissue paper, a foamed body, a foamed film, or the like can be used.

After hydrolysis with 20 mL of water, the organic layer was separated, dried, and the solvent was evaporated off, whereby 7.1 g (14.7 mmol) of (1,2′-dimethylsilylene)(2′,1-dimethylsilylene)bis(3-neopentylindene) was obtained as a light orange oily substance. Subsequently, in a nitrogen stream, 7.1 g (14.7 mmol) of (1,2′-dimethylsilylene)(2′,1-dimethylsilylene)bis(3-neopentylindene) and 40 mL of ether were added to a Schlenk bottle.

Then, a force of 2.0 kg/25 mm was applied twice to the bonded portion with a rubber roller, whereby the tape and the film were bonded to each other.

Then, a force of 2.0 kg/25 mm was applied twice to the bonded portion with a rubber roller, whereby the tape and the film were bonded to each other. A 1-kg weight was hung from the thus obtained test piece in an environment at a temperature of 50° C. and a humidity of 30%, and the time when the weight dropped from the adherend was measured.

In the case of Comparative Examples 1 and 3 in which only an amorphous polyolefin was used as the adhesive, and in the case of Comparative Example 2 in which a composition composed of an amorphous polyolefin and a tackifier was used as the adhesive, the storage elastic modulus of the composition at 25° C. and 50° C. was low, the holding strength was low, and also residual glue was left. Further, in the case of Comparative Example 4 in which a crystalline polypropylene (polymer h) in which the meso pentad fraction mmmm is more than 60 mol % and the relationship between the limiting viscosity and the stereoregularity does not satisfy the above formula (i) was used, the coatability was largely deteriorated, and the composition could not be coated with a hot roll coater heated to 110° C. Incidentally, if the temperature of the hot roll coater is raised up to about 200° C., the composition can be coated, however, a PET film or an OPP film to be used as the base material is deformed or melted. Further, there is also a method in which the adhesive is dissolved in a solvent such as toluene and coated, however, the solubility of the crystalline polypropylene in a solvent is poor, and the coatability thereof is also poor even if this method is adopted. On the other hand, in the case of Examples 1 to 8 in which a composition containing the crystalline polyolefin of the present invention was used as the adhesive, an adhesive base material which has high holding strength and leaves no residual glue could be provided.
