Step 1: Preparation of N-(8-bromo-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl) cyclopropanecarboxamide
To 8-bromo-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-amine(1.0 g, 4.7 mmol) and triethylamine (1.4 g, 14.1 mmol), dissolved in acetonitrile(15.0 mL), was added dropwise cyclopropanecarboxylic acid chloride(1.5 g, 14.1 mmol). Then the mixture is stirred at 26°C for reacting for 12 hours. LC-MC showed that the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure to remove acetonitrile. The residue was added to H2O(5 mL) and water layer was extracted with DCM(15 mL×3). The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated salt water(15 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure to remove the filtrate. The residue was purified through silica gel column chromatography(DCM/MeOH= 20/1) to give a yellow solid(700 mg, 47.8% yield).
