Provided are systems and methods for modifying waste fluids such that the waste fluids may be reused for their original purpose. There are many residential, commercial and industrial primary processes which utilize incoming clean fluids and generate waste fluids from the clean fluids. In many cases, the waste fluids are merely disposed of, such as by flushing the waste fluids into a sewer system. In other cases, the waste fluids may be processed before disposal, or may be processed for use in secondary processes which do not require the utmost clean fluids. In any case, the primary processes use large amounts of clean fluids, which leads to substantial costs associated with supplying the clean fluids to the primary processes. Furthermore, disposal of the waste fluids also leads to substantial costs, which may be even higher than the costs of supplying the clean fluids to the primary processes. In certain instances, the clean and waste fluids comprise liquids, and in some instances the liquid is water. In residential applications, for example, the cost of disposal of waste water in the sewer system may be directly proportional to the cost of the clean water supplied to the residence. In some instances, the sewer fees are higher than the water fees, because of the significant cost associated with processing the waste water before it can safely be reintroduced into the environment. In commercial and industrial applications, for example, waste water may be metered separately from supplied clean water, so that the costs associated with treating the waste water may be more accurately assessed. Furthermore, the waste water may be analyzed prior to or during disposal, in order to determine whether the waste water contains contaminants which further increases the cost of processing, either before final disposal or upon final waste water treatment. If certain contaminants are present, and/or are present at certain amounts, a surcharge may be applied to the fees associated with disposal of the waste water. For example, the amount of microbes present in the waste water can be measured by determining the biological oxygen demand (“BOD”) of the waste water, and if the BOD is measured to be higher than a certain amount, a surcharge may be assessed for processing the waste water at a sewer treatment facility. The costs associated with supplying clean water typically do not fully account for the fact that the mere removal of water from the ecosystem may be damaging to the ecosystem, including human and other life. Furthermore, water collected from the ecosystem may need to be treated prior to supplying the clean water to end users. The costs associated with treating waste water typically do not fully account for the harmful effect treatment chemicals may have on the ecosystem, including human and other life. Furthermore, manufacturing of treatment chemicals may also have a detrimental effect on the ecosystem which is not fully accounted for in the cost of the chemicals and/or in the cost of treatment. Supplying clean water and treating waste water also requires the use of resources and energy to collect, transport, use and treat both clean water and waste water, including the costs associated with manufacturing and supplying treatment chemicals for treating both clean water prior to use and waste water after use. The problems discussed above with regard to supplying clean water and disposing of waste water may be analogous to problems with regard to supplying and disposing of other liquids and/or fluids. In certain circumstances, it has been known to treat waste fluids prior to disposal, in order to remove contaminants and reduce the costs associated with disposal. However, this activity has its own costs, and does nothing to alleviate the costs of supplying clean fluids. Previous attempts have been made at treating waste fluids from primary processes for use in secondary processes. However, in many circumstances, such treatment is not cost-effective, because the costs of transporting the waste fluid significant distances to a treatment process and then, after treatment, to the secondary process may be cost-prohibitive. These costs may include, for example, the costs of large pumps and long conduits needed to transport the fluid. Furthermore, space is typically limited in manufacturing facilities, and large pumps and long conduits take up significant amounts of space, which may not be available in some manufacturing facilities. What is needed are systems and/or methods for treating waste fluids such that they may be reused in the primary process which generates the waste fluids. The subject systems and/or methods may reduce the consumption of clean fluids and costs associated therewith, reduce the generation of waste fluids which must be disposed of and the costs associated therewith, reduce the environmental impacts of removing fluids from the environment and/or of manufacturing and using treatment chemicals, and/or minimize the cost of transporting the waste fluids for treatment and/or reuse. Embodiments of the disclosed subject matter are disclosed with reference to the accompanying drawings and are for illustrative purposes only. The subject matter is not limited in its application to the details of construction or the arrangement of the components illustrated in the drawings. Like reference numerals are used to indicate like components, unless otherwise indicated. FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a subject system as disclosed herein. FIG. 2 illustrates an embodiment of a subject system as disclosed herein. Provided is a system for use with a processing apparatus comprising a clean fluid entry portion and a waste fluid discharge portion, wherein the processing apparatus uses clean fluid in a process which results in the clean fluid becoming waste fluid; the system comprising: (a) a fluid modification apparatus comprising: (i) a first end capable of being in fluid communication with the waste fluid discharge portion; (ii) a second end capable of being in fluid communication with the clean fluid entry portion; and (iii) at least one fluid modification device in fluid communication with the first end and the second end, wherein the at least one fluid modification device modifies the waste fluid; (b) at least one analyzing device which determines: (i) whether the system is operating normally; and/or (ii) whether the modified waste fluid has become clean fluid; and (c) at least one fluid transport apparatus which returns the modified waste fluid to the processing apparatus, if the at least one analyzing device determines that the system is operating normally and/or that the modified waste fluid has become clean fluid. In certain embodiments, the waste fluid may comprise a liquid. In certain embodiments, the waste fluid may comprise water. As used herein the term “clean fluid” means a fluid suitable for use in the processing apparatus, for the specific purpose for which the processing apparatus uses the clean fluid. As used herein, the term “waste fluid” means a fluid which is discharged from the processing apparatus after use in the processing apparatus. For example, the clean fluid may comprise a clean fluid supplied by an outside supplier, such as clean water supplied by a local water system. The clean fluid may also comprise a modified waste fluid which has been modified such that it may be used equivalently to the clean fluid supplied by an outside supplier. The systems are also suitable for use with processes which require expensive deionized water as the clean fluid, such as processes used by the semiconductor and medical device industries. As used herein, the term “in fluid communication” means fluid may be transported directly or indirectly between two or more components, via now known or hereafter discovered means. As used herein, the term “fluid modification device” means any device which modifies a fluid in any manner now known or hereafter discovered. For example, but without limitation, a fluid modification device: may alter any properties of a fluid, such as the temperature, pressure and/or chemical composition of the fluid; may add matter to the fluid; may remove matter from the fluid; or may alter matter present in the fluid. As used herein, the term “analyzing device” means a device which is capable of: (i) determining whether the system is operating normally by any manner now known or hereafter discovered; and/or (ii) analyzing the contents and/or properties of a fluid by any manner now known or hereafter discovered. By “operating normally”, what is meant is that the system is operating as designed and intended as described herein without fault or error, such that the system is capturing the waste fluid from the processing apparatus, transporting the waste fluid through the fluid modification apparatus, and returning the modified waste fluid to the processing apparatus. With regard to the analyzing device being capable of determining whether the system is operating normally, in certain embodiments, the analyzing device may be able to determine at least one of: (i) whether fluid is flowing through the system, (ii) whether the power requirements for transporting fluid through the system indicate that there is a problem within the system, or (iii) whether a component of the system has failed and/or has been removed from the system. In embodiments in which the analyzing device only determines whether the system is operating normally, it is assumed that the system is modifying the waste fluid such that the modified waste fluid becomes clean fluid, and ongoing analysis of the contents and/or properties of the modified waste fluid is not required. In this circumstance, it may be desirable to perform maintenance on the system on regular intervals. As used herein, the term “fluid transport apparatus” means an apparatus which is capable of moving a fluid by any manner now known or hereafter discovered. For example, but without limitation, a fluid transport apparatus may comprise a pump. For example, but without limitation, the pump may comprise a gear pump, a screw pump, a progressive cavity pump, a roots-type pump, a peristaltic pump, a plunger pump, a triplex-style pump, a flexible impeller pump, rotolliptic pump, a hydraulic ram pump, a centrifugal pump, a radial flow pump, an axial flow pump, a mixed flow pump, an educator jet pump, a gravity pump, a steam pump, or a valveless pump. Without limitation, examples of the processing apparatus include: (i) apparatus which rinse and/or wash items, such as food and/or beverage containers, components of manufacture or finished manufactured products, such as quartz components for the semiconductor industry; or (ii) apparatus which are used to cool and/or clean moving parts of an associated apparatus, such as a piston cooling apparatus. The processing apparatus utilizes a clean fluid in a process which results in the clean fluid becoming a waste fluid. By way of example, and not in limitation, the processing apparatus may comprise a milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus. The milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus draws clean water from a source of clean water (such as water provided by a governmental water system), optionally adds a washing agent to the clean water, and rinses/washes the milk jugs with the clean water. Once the clean water comes into contact with the milk jug, it collects any milk residue and other matter from the exterior of the milk jug, and the clean water becomes waste water. Conventionally, the waste water generated by the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus is merely disposed of. In some instances, the waste water is allowed to merely drop to the floor and run to a drain, the drain being in fluid communication with a sewer, such as a governmental sewer system. In this example, the clean water must meet regulatory requirements, such as including maximum levels of contaminants and/or microbes. Such regulatory requirements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some regulatory requirements require that the BOD of water containing microbes be limited to a certain maximum level in order for the water to be suitable for use in rinsing/washing milk jugs. Thus, in certain embodiments, the subject system(s) may be capable of eliminating and/or removing microbes from the water, in order to decrease the BOD of the water below the regulatory maximum. Systems for decreasing the BOD of water for use in rinsing/washing milk jugs have previously been theorized. However, in order to minimize costs, such that the systems would be cost-effective for use with milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus, these theories focused on using a small number of small physical filters to remove contaminants. The previous attempts also did not consider the use of UV radiation generators. For these reasons, the theoretical systems were never designed, built or tested. In an embodiment, a system is provided to capture the waste water from the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus, modify the waste water, determine whether the modified waste water has become clean water, and return the clean water to the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus. Thus, in order to become clean water, the modified waste water must meet the regulatory requirements mentioned above. The modified waste water may then be used equivalently to the clean water supplied from the source of clean water. The system thus collects and reuses waste water in order to reduce resource consumption, including financial resources, reduce negative environmental impacts, and/or reduce safety hazards, by keeping the waste water from falling to the floor, where it may cause a human slip hazard. In certain embodiments, subject systems may be suitable for use with processes used in the following industries: beverage manufacturing, including dairy beverages, juice beverages, soda beverages, and alcoholic beverages; food manufacturing; silicon manufacturing; quartz manufacturing; and/or mechanical system manufacturing. In certain embodiments, it may not be necessary to determine whether the modified waste fluid has become clean fluid before returning the modified waste fluid to the processing apparatus. For example, the clean fluid used in the processing apparatus may not be subject to regulatory requirements, or the processing apparatus may not create waste fluid which needs to be tested for contaminants before reuse. In an embodiment, the provided system may comprise: (a) a fluid modification apparatus comprising: (i) a first end capable of being in fluid communication with the waste fluid discharge portion; (ii) a second end capable of being in fluid communication with the clean fluid entry portion; and (iii) at least one fluid modification device in fluid communication with the first end and the second end, wherein the at least one fluid modification device modifies the waste fluid; (b) at least one analyzing device which determines whether the system is operating normally; and (c) at least one fluid transport apparatus which returns the modified waste fluid to the processing apparatus, if the at least one analyzing device determines that the system is operating normally.

Referring to FIG. 1, a system 10 is provided, associated with processing apparatus 24. The system 10 includes a fluid modification apparatus 12 which includes a first end 18, a second end 20, and at least one fluid modification device 22. The first end 18 of the fluid modification apparatus 12 is in fluid communication with a waste fluid discharge portion 28 of the processing apparatus 24 via an inlet 32 of a reservoir 30, an outlet 34 of the reservoir 30 and at least one fluid transport apparatus 16 (such as a pump). The second end 20 of the fluid modification apparatus 12 is in fluid communication with a clean fluid entry portion 26 of the processing apparatus 24 via at least one analyzing device 14. The analyzing device 14 may or may not be in fluid communication with the system. In use, the embodiment of FIG. 1 may be described as follows. A clean fluid is provided from a clean fluid source 42 to the clean fluid entry portion 26 of the processing apparatus 24. The processing apparatus 24 utilizes the clean fluid in a process which results in the clean fluid becoming a waste fluid. The waste fluid is discharged from the processing apparatus 24 via the waste fluid discharge portion 28. An optional reservoir 30 collects the waste fluid via the inlet 32. The waste fluid leaves the reservoir 30 via outlet 34, and the fluid transport apparatus 16 transports the fluid to the first end 18 of the fluid modification apparatus 12. The at least one fluid modification device 22 modifies the waste fluid and discharges the waste fluid via second end 20.

If the system 10 is operating normally and/or the modified waste fluid is determined to be clean fluid, the fluid modification apparatus 12 returns the clean fluid to the clean fluid entry portion 26 of the processing apparatus 24. If the system 10 is not operating normally and/or the modified waste fluid is determined to not be clean fluid, the fluid modification apparatus causes the system to discharge the waste fluid to a waste fluid disposal 44, such as a sewer drain. The embodiment of FIG. 1 also comprises any necessary conduits, valves or other known components in order to make the embodiment function as described. The embodiment of FIG. 1 may comprise a logic controller (not shown) which controls the features described in this paragraph in a suitable manner to provide the appropriate functionality described. Referring to FIG. 2, a system 40 is provided, comprising many of the components illustrated in FIG. 1. In use, the embodiment of FIG. 2 may be described as follows. Clean water is provided from clean fluid source 42 to the clean fluid entry portion 26 of the processing apparatus 24. The processing apparatus 24 utilizes the clean water in a process, such as a milk jug rinsing/washing process, which results in the clean water becoming waste water. The waste water is discharged from the processing apparatus 24 via a waste fluid collector 36 and the waste fluid discharge portion 28. An optional reservoir 30, having an optional cone-shaped bottom 38, collects the waste fluid via the inlet 32. The waste fluid leaves the reservoir 30 via outlet 34, and the fluid transport apparatus 16 (such as a pump) transports the fluid to the first end 18 of the fluid modification apparatus 12. The fluid modification devices 22A, 22B, 22C, 22D, modify the waste water and discharge the waste water via second end 20. The fluid modification device 22A may comprise a filter, such as a 20 μm polypropylene filter.

The at least one analyzing device 14 determines whether the system 40 is operating normally and/or analyzes the modified waste fluid to determine whether the modified waste fluid has become a clean fluid. If the system 40 is operating normally and/or the modified waste fluid is determined to be clean fluid, the system 40 returns the clean fluid to the clean fluid entry portion 26 of the processing apparatus 24. If the system 40 is not operating normally and/or the modified waste fluid is determined to not be clean fluid, the fluid modification apparatus causes the system to discharge the waste fluid to a waste fluid disposal 44, such as a sewer drain. The system 40 also comprises any necessary conduits, valves or other known components in order to make the embodiment function as described. The system 40 may comprise a logic controller associated with the various components described above, as well as with any valves which may be present in the system 40, in a suitable manner to provide the appropriate functionality described. In certain embodiments, the components of the systems illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 and described above may be placed in any order which allows for the system to operate as described and intended. For example, the fluid transport apparatus may be placed in one or more numerous positions within the system(s) and still allow the system to function as intended. Similarly, the optional reservoir may be placed in one or more numerous positions throughout the system. Other features of the system may also be placed in one or more numerous positions throughout the system. It is also possible, in certain embodiments, to place the various system components in parallel. For example, if a plurality of fluid modification devices are used, they may be placed in series and/or in parallel. Similarly, the at least one analyzing device may be placed in series and/or in parallel with the other components of the system. The at least one fluid transport apparatus may also be placed in series and/or in parallel with the other system components. The following example is set forth merely to further illustrate the subject systems and/or methods. The illustrative example should not be construed as limiting the subject matter in any manner, and represents specific non-limiting embodiments of the subject matter. Clean water enters a milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus from a source of clean water, such as a governmental water system, rinses/washes the milk jugs, and exits the apparatus as waste water. A collector collects the waste water and conveys it to a reservoir, such as a 30 or 60 gallon tank. The reservoir comprises two level sensors, one near the bottom of the reservoir and one near the top of the reservoir. The level sensors are in electronic communication with a logic controller. The reservoir is in fluid communication with a conduit comprising a valve, which determines whether the waste water in the reservoir is fed to a sewer drain. The valve is also in electronic communication with the logic controller. When the valve is in position to feed the waste water to the system, the system is in “recycle mode”. When the valve is in position to feed the waste water to the sewer drain, the system is in “maintenance mode”. When the system is in recycle mode, a pump, such as a pump comprising a three-quarter horsepower motor, transports the waste water from the reservoir through the system. The pump is capable of transporting from about 15 L/min to about 36 L/min of water. The waste water travels first to a first fluid modification device comprising a filter, such as a 20 μm polypropylene filter. The waste water then travels to a second fluid modification device comprising a UV radiation generator, such as a UV lamp which emits radiation at a wavelength of about 254 nm capable of killing microbes. The waste water then proceeds to a third fluid modification device comprising a filter, such as a 1 μm polypropylene filter. The water then travels to a fourth fluid modification device comprising a UV radiation generator, such as a UV lamp which emits radiation at a wavelength capable of killing microbes and generating ozone. The ozone provides an antimicrobial affect, and has a half-life of about 20 minutes in water at 20° C., about 15 minutes in water at 25° C. and about 12 minutes in water at 30° C., such that the ozone provides an antimicrobial affect while the modified waste water is reused in the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus. The fourth fluid modification device is in fluid communication with the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus via a conduit separate from the conduit which supplies clean water to the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus from the source of clean water. After the modified waste water leaves the fourth fluid modification device, it is analyzed by an analyzing device, which is in electronic communication with the logic controller. The analyzing device may or may not be in fluid communication with the system, in that certain properties and/or contents of the modified waste water may be determined without the modified waste water contacting the analyzing device, while other properties and/or contents of the modified waste water may only be determined if the modified waste water is in contact with the analyzing device. Further, if the analyzing device is in fluid communication with the system, it may either be in series or parallel with the system. The analyzing device may be capable of determining many properties and/or contents of the modified waste water, such as the BOD and/or the pH of the modified waste fluid. The analyzing device sends at least one signal to the logic controller, and the logic controller then determines whether the modified waste water is suitable for reuse in the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus. If the logic controller determines that the water is suitable for reuse, the valve present on the incoming clean water conduit is oriented such that the modified waste fluid is supplied to the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus, rather than clean water from the source of clean water. If the logic controller determines that the water is not suitable for reuse, the system enters maintenance mode, and the valve in fluid communication with the reservoir is oriented such that the system dumps the waste water into the sewer drain, and the valve present on the incoming clean water conduit is oriented such that clean water from the clean water source is supplied to the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus. In certain embodiments, the logic controller may only allow the system to operate in recycle mode if the level sensor present near the top of the reservoir indicates that the reservoir is holding a substantial amount of waste water, which ensures that there is enough waste water present in the reservoir such that the system will be able to modify the waste water and return it to the milk jug rinsing/washing apparatus before the reservoir becomes empty. In certain embodiments, the logic controller may determine that it is necessary to supply clean water from the source of clean water if the level sensor present near the bottom of the reservoir indicates that there is very little or no water remaining in the reservoir. This may or may not result in the system entering maintenance mode. The logic controller may also be capable of determining whether a malfunction has occurred within the system, in which instance the system will enter maintenance mode.
