Related Background Art The compound N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide (alternatively, N-hydroxy-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl}-phenyl)-acrylamide) has the formula as described in WO 02/22577. Valuable pharmacological properties are attributed to this compound; thus, it can be used, for example, as a histone deacetylase inhibitor useful in therapy for diseases which respond to inhibition of histone deacetylase activity. Previous attempts by the inventors to make this compound have had limited success due to the presence of various impurities and by-products in the reaction product; the removal of such impurities and by-products requires lengthy and tedious reworking/re-crystallization of the desired product. Thus, synthesis ofN-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide has heretofore been complicated, time-consuming and limited to small-scale synthesis. EP0233413 discloses a process to obtain similar compounds.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure is directed to a method of making N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indo1-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide comprising the steps of: (a) combining (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt and sodium hydroxide to form an admixture at a temperature of less than about -10°C; and subsequently (b) adding hydroxylamine to the admixture to form the N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide as shown below; Additionally, the method may comprise the steps of crystallizing and isolating the N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide. The inventive method does not require time-consuming, complicated reworking/re-crystallization of reaction product steps. In other words, the inventive method allows for the yield of N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide in one single process step in high yield and sufficient quality. In the first step of the method of the first reference embodiment, (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt and sodium hydroxide are combined at a temperature of less than about -10°C to form an admixture. More preferably, the temperature is less than about -15°C. In one reference embodiment, the temperature is about 0°C. The temperature can be achieved and maintained via any suitable means. Likewise, the admixture can be made in any suitable vessel which must be free of iron and heavy metals wherein the reaction is performed under an inert atmosphere. Heavy metals and iron (metallic Fe and its salts) would catalyse the decomposition of hydroxylamine Typically, the (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt (alternatively known as 3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl}-phenyl)-(2E)-2-propenoic acid methyl ester is provided in the form of a suspension in methanol. Preferably, the (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt is placed in a suitable reaction vessel to which methanol is added, and the resulting suspension is then cooled to a temperature of less than about -10°C. (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt can be prepared according to the method of the invention. (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt is preferably defined as 1.0 equivalent. Typically, the sodium hydroxide is provided in the form of a solution, preferably in methanol. Sodium hydroxide is a commercially available starting material. Sodium hydroxide is preferably used in an amount ranging from about 2.5 to about 3.5 equivalents. Preferably a methanol solution of sodium hydroxide is added to a suspension of (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt in a suitable reaction vessel over a period of time. More preferably, the sodium hydroxide solution is added over a period of time of about 20-40 minutes, preferably 30 minutes, while maintaining the temperature of less than about -10°C. In the second step of the method of the first reference embodiment, hydroxylamine is added to the admixture from the first step to form the N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide. The temperature of the first step, i.e., less than about -10°C, is maintained during this step. Typically the hydroxylamine is supplied in the form of a solution in water. Hydroxylamine is a commercially available starting material. Hydroxylamine is preferably used in an amount ranging from about 4 to about 13 equivalents. Preferably an aqueous solution of hydroxylamine, e.g., a 50% in water solution, is added to the admixture of (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt and sodium hydroxide in a suitable reaction vessel over a period of time. More preferably, the hydroxylamine solution is added over a period of time of about 20-24 minutes, preferably about 30 minutes, while maintaining the temperature of less than about -10°C. In the course of conducting step (b), caution should be taken to add the hydroxylamine to the admixture in such a manner as to avoid contact with any apparatus or vessel used for the sodium hydroxide in step (a), e.g., the same addition funnel should not be used; in other words, reaction between hydroxylamine and sodium hydroxide should be avoided prior to adding the hydroxylamine to the admixture. In addition, all vessels and pipelines used for the addition of hydroxylamine must be free of iron and heavy metals. In a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the mixture is stirred at the temperature of step (a) until the reaction is complete or nearly complete; typically, completion of the reaction takes about 7 hours. Completion of the reaction can be monitored by HPLC; in one preferred embodiment, a conversion of >99.5% is seen. The method of the first reference embodiment may further comprise the step of (c) crystallizing the N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide.

In step (c1), the reaction mixture is formed when the hydroxylamine is added to the admixture of the methyl ester and the sodium hydroxide. Preferably the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 25°C. Heating can be accomplished by any suitable means. In step (c2), the reaction mixture is stirred at the temperature achieved by the heating of step (c1). Preferably the reaction mixture is stirred for a period of time of about 13 hours. In one preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, steps (c1) and (c2) are repeated to achieve gradual heating, i.e., the reaction mixture is first heated to a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 5°C and stirred for about 4-6 hours, preferably 5 hours and then heated to a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 25°C and stirred for an additional about 8-16 hours. In step (c3), water is added to the reaction mixture. Typically, demineralized water is added over a period of time, more preferably over a period of about 30 minutes at a temperature between about 20-25 °C, to achieve a solution. In step (c4), the reaction mixture is filtered to provide a filtrate. Filtration can be accomplished using any suitable means or filter medium; Step (c4) also optionally comprises the sub-step of washing the filtering medium and adding the wash to the filtrate obtained. In step (c5), the pH of the filtrate is adjusted to a pH ranging from about 10 to about 11, more preferably from about 10.3 to about 10.7. Addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid is typically used for this purpose. In step (c6), seed crystals of N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide are added to the filtrate. This is typically accomplished by the introduction of an aqueous suspension of N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide crystals. In step (c7), the filtrate is stirred until a suspension results. Preferably the filtrate is stirred for a period of about 30 minutes to several hours, until crystallization becomes evident and visible. In step (c8), the pH of the suspension is adjusted to a pH ranging from about 8.5 to about 9. Addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid is typically used for this purpose. In step (c9), the suspension is stirred until the N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide crystallizes. Preferably the suspension is stirred for a period of about 30 minutes to several hours until the reaction is complete. The method of the first reference embodiment may further comprise the step of (d) isolating the N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide. In a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, such a step may include any or all of the sub-steps of: (d1) filtering the crystallized N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide from step (c); and (d2) drying the crystallized N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide. In step (d1), the crystallized N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide is filtered. Filtration can be accomplished using any suitable means. Typically the filter cake is washed with, e.g., a 1:1 mixture of de-mineralized water and methanol. In step (d2), the crystallized N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide is dried. Drying can be accomplished by any suitable means. Drying at 45-50°C/1-5 mbar for about 24 hours was usually sufficient. The present invention is directed to a method of making (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt, one of the starting materials used in the synthesis of N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2E-2-propenamide in the first reference embodiment. In particular, the present invention is directed to a method of making (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt comprising the steps of: (a) combining 2-methyltryptamine and (E)-3-(4-formylphenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester to form an admixture; (b) stirring the admixture for a time and at a temperature sufficient to form an imine intermediate; and (c) reducing the imine intermediate to form the (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt. In the first step of the method of the invention, 2-methyl tryptamine and (E)-3-(4-formyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester are combined to form an admixture. Preferably the temperature ranges from about 20°C to about 25°C. The admixture can be made in any suitable vessel. Typically both the 2-methyltryptamine and the (E)-3-(4-formyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester are dissolved in a solvent, e.g., methanol, to accomplish admixture. 2-Methyltryptamine is made according to known syntheses or made according to the method of the third embodiment of the disclosure below. 2-Methyltryptamine is preferably used in an amount ranging from about 0.9 to about 1.0 equivalents. (E)-3-(4-formyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester can be purchased from a commercial source or made according to known syntheses. (E)-3-(4-formyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester is preferably used in an amount ranging from about 1.0 to about 1.1 equivalents. In the second step, the admixture of 2-methyltryptamine and (E)-3-(4-formyl-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester is stirred for a time and at a temperature sufficient to produce the imine intermediate Preferably the admixture is stirred for about 1 hour at a temperature ranging from about 20 to about 25°C. In step (c) of the method of the invention, the imine intermediate is reduced with sodium borohydride to form the (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester, which is subsequently crystallized/precipitated as hydrochloride salt. Step (c) comprises the sub-steps of: (c1) cooling the admixture; (c2) adding sodium borohydride to the admixture; and (c3) combining the admixture with hydrochloric acid to crystallize/precipitate the (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt. In one embodiment of the invention, the admixture is diluted with solvent, e.g., methanol, prior to sub-step (c1). The cooling of sub-step (c1) can be accomplished by any known means, e.g., ice bath, cooling jacket, etc. Preferably the admixture is cooled to a temperature of about -10 to -20 °C, preferably -15°C. The addition of the sodium borohydride in sub-step (c2) is preferably accomplished in portions over a period of time while maintaining the temperature of sub-step (c1). More preferably, the time for addition is about 1 hour and the temperature maintained ranges from about -15°C to about -10°C. Preferably the sodium borohydride is added in solid form and in an amount ranging from about 0.4 to about 0.7 equivalents. In sub-step (c3), the admixture is combined with an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid to precipitate the (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt. Preferably this sub-step is carried out after a period of stirring the admixture of sub-step (c2). Combination with the hydrochloric acid can be accomplished in accordance with this invention in several ways. One preferred manner comprises the slow addition of the admixture to pre-cooled aqueous hydrochloric acid solution; typically the hydrochloric acid solution is cooled to a temperature of about 0°C to about 5°C. Another preferred manner of combining with hydrochloric acid comprises the sub-steps of: (c3a) heating the admixture of sub-step (c2); (c3b) adding water to the admixture; and (c3c) adding hydrochloric acid to the admixture to precipitate (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt. In sub-step (c3a), the admixture is heated to a temperature ranging from about 20°C to about 25°C over a period of time of about 20-45 minutes, preferably about 25 minutes. In sub-step (c3b), water is added slowly, preferably after a period of stirring the admixture of sub-step (c3a). In sub-step (c3c), preferably the hydrochloric acid is aqueous and added slowly in portion. Preferably, the first portion of the hydrochloric acid is as much as needed to adjust the pH of the reaction mixture to 8.5. The hydrochloric acid solution is added such that the temperature is maintained at 20-25 °C. Subsequently, the reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for at least one hour to allow crystallization of the product, before more hydrochloric acid can be added. The method of the invention may also comprise the step of (d) heating and cooling the suspension of (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt to improve quality and increase filterability. In a preferred embodiment such a step may include any or all of the sub-steps of: (d1) heating the suspension formed when the imine intermediate is reduced and hydrochloric acid is added to form the hydrochloride in step (c); (d2) stirring the suspension at the temperature of sub-step (d1); (d3) cooling the suspension; and (d4) stirring the suspension at the temperature of sub-step (d3).

In a typical process, distillation is continued at the same conditions by removing ethanol and then additional water is added to the residual mixture. Water is preferably added in an amount ranging from about 10 to about 20 parts. In the fifth step of the method of the third reference embodiment, the residual solution is cooled to form 2-methyltryptamine. Typically, the residual solution is cooled to a temperature of less than about 25°C. The method of the third reference embodiment may further comprise the step of (f) isolating and purifying the 2-methyltryptamine. In preferred embodiments of the present disclosure, step (f) includes the sub-steps of: (f1) washing the residual solution with toluene; (f2) isolating the 2-methyltryptamine; (f3) washing the 2-methyltryptamine with toluene; and (f4) drying the 2-methyltryptamine.

In step (f3), the 2-methyltryptamine is washed with toluene, preferably cold toluene, i.e., ≤ 0°C. In step (f4), the 2-methyltryptamine is dried. Drying can be accomplished by any suitable means. Drying under vacuum at 45°C until an LOD of < 1% is obtained is particularly preferred. The method of the third reference embodiment can be used to produce 2-methyltryptamine which is a starting material in the synthesis of (E)-3-(4-{[2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethylamino]-methyl]-phenyl)-acrylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt.
