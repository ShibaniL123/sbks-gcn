COOPERATING LINKABLE, DEFORMABLE CHOPSTICKS RELATED CASES [0001] The present patent application claims the benefit of Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/798,059 filed on March 15, 2013, entitled “Cooperating Notched, Deformable Chopsticks” by Keith Μ. Pecoraro, said application being hereby incorporated by reference herein for all that it discloses and teaches. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates generally to eating utensils and, more particularly, to flexible chopsticks which may be cooperatively attached to enable more facile use for grasping objects. BACKGROUND [0003] Chopsticks can be difficult for many people to use due to the manual dexterity and coordination required in manipulating the individual chopsticks so that they work as a unified pair. Many products have been designed to connect the individual chopsticks to provide spring-like action, thereby permitting unskilled users to hold and manipulate the chopsticks more easily. [0004] Solutions include spring-like, flexible bridging members for connecting two chopsticks to form a unified pair. Since an additional, generally plastic, member is required to accomplish this function, the cost of the utensil is increased and, if not reused, the member wastes resources and increases environmental pollution. Further, in a restaurant environment, waiters must inquire as to who needs assistance in using standard chopsticks, making some patrons uncomfortable and requiring extra time. [0005] Integral, tweezer-like tools have been designed for picking up food. However, such complex shapes are generally expensive to manufacture and package. Chopsticks have also been joined near one end using channeled joint portions, with elongated thin slits providing a leaf-spring-like mechanism, wherein a pincer-like function is obtained, the spring elements opening the chopsticks when the user is not squeezing them together. This action also tends to make the chopsticks separate if not carefully held together by a user. [0006] A variation of this latter apparatus includes pair of molded plastic chopsticks joined by an oblique channel close to the upper end of the chopsticks having ribs emerging towards the inside of the channel, whereby the chopsticks are adapted to be snap-fitted together. The lower ends thereof may be brought together because of the flexible nature of the material of fabrication. However, when not being gripped by the user, the geometry of the simple oblique channel allows the chopsticks to rotate so that the angle between them increases and the channel joint no longer holds together. Additionally, this configuration tends to place large shear forces on the channel, making it impractical to manufacture the chopsticks from many common materials. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0007] Embodiments of the present invention overcome the disadvantages and limitations of the prior art by providing chopsticks which may be used in the traditional manner when unattached, or used with the chopsticks cooperatively attached to one another for grasping objects. [0008] Another object of embodiments of the present invention is to provide chopsticks which may be cooperatively attached to one another for grasping objects without requiring an added spring-like mechanism for automatically separating the grasping ends of the chopsticks when the user wishes to release the object. [0009] Yet another object of embodiments of the present invention is to provide chopsticks which may be cooperatively attached to one another for grasping objects, and which require only a minor effort to squeeze the grasping ends together for grasping an object. [0010] Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. [0011] To achieve the foregoing and other objects, and in accordance with the purposes of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the pair of chopsticks hereof, includes: a first chopstick having a chosen long dimension an upper side and an opposing lower side, an outer side and an opposing inner side, a food grasping end and a second end, a first channel in the upper side disposed at a chosen angle relative to the long dimension of the first chopstick in the region of the second end thereof, having a selected depth, and a chosen width, and forming a first base member between the depth of the first channel and the lower side; a second chopstick, identical to the first chopstick, having a chosen long dimension an upper side and an opposing lower side, an outer side and an inner side, a food grasping end and a second end, a second channel in the upper side disposed at a chosen angle relative to the long dimension of said first chopstick in the region of the second end thereof having a selected depth, and a chosen width, and forming a second base member between the depth of the second channel and the lower side; wherein the first base member of the first chopstick is inserted into the second channel of the second chopstick, with the second base member of the second chopstick being inserted into the first channel of the first chopstick, forming a joint having the chosen angle between the first chopstick and the second chopstick; and a retaining member for holding the first chopstick and the second chopstick together at the joint. [0012] In another aspect of the invention and in accordance with its objects and purposes, the pair of chopsticks hereof, includes: a first chopstick having a chosen long dimension an upper side and an opposing lower side, an outer side and an inner side, a food grasping end and a second end, a first channel in the upper side disposed at a chosen oblique angle relative to the long dimension of the first chopstick in the region of the second end thereof, the first channel opening both into the outer side and the inner side and having a first end closest to the second end of the first chopstick, and a second end closest to the grasping end and a midpoint therebetween, having a selected depth, and a chosen width, forming a first base member between the depth of the first channel and the lower side, there being a first slanted indentation in the outer side beginning at the first end of the channel and ending at the midpoint thereof, and a second slanted indentation in the inner side beginning at the second end of the channel and ending at the midpoint thereof, forming a first side stop having a first face, and a second side stop having a second face, respectively, at the midpoint; and a second chopstick, identical to the first chopstick, having a chosen long dimension an upper side and an opposing lower side, an outer side and an inner side, a food grasping end and a second end, a second channel in the upper side disposed at a chosen oblique angle relative to the long dimension of the second chopstick in the region of the second end thereof, the second channel opening both into the outer side and the inner side and having a first end closest to the second end of said second chopstick, and a second end closest to the grasping end and a midpoint therebetween, having a selected depth, and a chosen width, forming a second base member between the depth of the second channel and the lower side, there being a first slanted indentation in the outer side beginning at the first end of the channel and ending at the midpoint thereof, and a second slanted indentation in the inner side beginning at the second end of the channel and ending at the midpoint thereof, forming a first side stop having a first face, and a second side stop having a second face, respectively, at the midpoint; wherein the first base member of the first chopstick is inserted into the second channel of the second chopstick, with the second base member of the second chopstick being inserted into the first channel of the first chopstick, forming a joint having the chosen oblique angle, wherein the first face of the first side stop of the first chopstick engages the second face of the second side stop of the second chopstick and the second face of the second side stop of the first chopstick engages the first face of the first side stop of the second chopstick, thereby preventing rotation of the first chopstick and the second chopstick in the joint. [0013] Benefits and advantages of embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, providing flexible chopsticks which may be reversibly cooperatively joined to enable more facile use thereof for grasping objects. The identical chopsticks may be fabricated from sustainable materials with a minimum of waste, and can be manufactured as a pair in a single, attached unit, such that the individual chopsticks can then be separated prior to use.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0026] Embodiments of the present invention include a pair of chopsticks that are easily attached and detached in a cooperating manner for providing a forceps- or tweezers-like spring action for grasping objects, such as food, or for being used in the conventional manner for using chopsticks. Identical angled channels located in the vicinity of the non-grasping end of each chopstick and having a depth of about one-half the width of the chopstick, permit the opposing channels to be fitted together to join the chopsticks. A retaining member may be wrapped around the channel joint to stabilize the joint and hold the chopsticks together. A portion of the material is removed between the joining channel and the grasping end of each chopstick, thereby reducing the rigidity of the chopstick and its resistance to bending. That is, a spring-like section is generated, whereby although the chopsticks remain straight, they may be flexed by application of only moderate squeezing force between the spring portion and the grasping end of the chopstick, with mild shear forces generated at the channels. As will be described hereinbelow, this may be accomplished in several ways. The assembled chopstick pair may then be operated in a similar manner to tweezers or forceps, or salad tongs sprung at one end, for grasping food. [0027] The chopsticks may be fabricated as a pair from a single piece of bamboo or other wood with a thin line of material therebetween such that the individual chopsticks can be separated before use. The retaining member may be formed from a portion of the paper chopstick packaging material. The chopsticks may be fabricated from other materials as well, including plastic and metal, as examples. [0028] The chopsticks may be straight or tapered, and may have square, circular or oval cross-sections, as examples. [0029] In another embodiment, two shallow angled side indentations are cut into the width of each chopstick at diagonally opposing sides of the primary angled channel formed therein, creating compression surfaces which oppose rotation and opening of the channel joint. Back cuts in the side indentation and in the primary channel permit the chopsticks to be reversibly snap-locked together such that the chopsticks may be assembled and disassembled as desired. In this situation, no external retaining tension member is required at the assembled channel joint. [0030] Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the FIGURES, similar structure will be identified using identical reference characters. It will be understood that the FIGURES are for the purpose of describing particular embodiments of the invention and are not intended to limit the invention thereto. Turning now to FIG. 1, a pair of attached identical chopsticks, 12, is shown in its open configuration, and includes chopsticks, 14a, and, 14b, and retaining member, 16, which is wrapped around joint, 18, which keeps the two chopsticks at chosen angle, 19. Chopsticks 12 may be used as a utensil for grasping food and other objects. Hand, 20, is shown holding the chopsticks at the squeezing region, 21a, and, 21b, toward the grasping region, 22a, and 22b, thereof, opposite top region, 24a, and 24b. [0031] FIGURE 2 shows hand 20 squeezing the squeezing region 21a and 21b, forcing the grasping regions 22a and 22b together, thereby enabling chopsticks 12 to grasp food or other objects. It may be observed from FIG. 1 hereof that in the open configuration, chopsticks 14a and 14b are generally straight, while FIG. 2 illustrates that in the grasping configuration, chopsticks 14a and 14b are bent inwardly by the action of forefinger, 26, and thumb, 28, of hand 20, thereby reducing the chosen angle 19 imparted to the attached pair of chopsticks by joint 18. To achieve this function, chopsticks 14a and 14b have spring regions, 30a, and, 30b, respectively, which are thinner than the chopstick thickness, 36a, and 36b, to increase flexibility in the direction of bending such that the chopsticks may be bent without applying significant force or breaking joint 18. [0032] FIGURE 3 illustrates a pair of separated chopsticks, which as stated hereinabove can be used in the traditional manner for using chopsticks. Each identical chopstick 14a, 14b, may be constructed from a single piece of material. Channel, 32a, is formed at a chosen angle near top 24a of chopstick 14a, with an identical channel, 32b, formed in the identical location in chopstick 14b. The material remaining behind channels, 32a, and, 32b are termed base members, 33a, and, 33b, respectively. The depths, 31a, and, 31b, of channels 32a and 32b are typically about one-half of width, 34a, 34b, of the side of the chopstick in which the channel is formed, but may be less. Channel widths, 39a, and, 39b, may be equal to chopstick thickness 36a, and, 36b. Channels 32a and 32b, are formed at angles, 38a, and, 38b, between about 15° and about 30° from axes, 40a, and, 40b, parallel to the length (long dimension) of chopsticks 14a, and 14b, respectively, such that when chopsticks 14a and 14b are joined into assembly 12 by placing opposing channels 32a, and 32b together, joint 18 is formed having a resultant angle 19 (FIG. 1 hereof) between chopsticks 14a and 14b equal to angles 38a and 38b. Retainer 16 (FIGS. 1 and 2 hereof) may be affixed around the joined channels 32 to add rigidity to joint 18 and to keep chopsticks 14a and 14b together. [0033] Lengthwise sides or faces of chopsticks 14a and 14b are labeled as faces, 41a (upper side or face), and, 41b, 42a (inner side or face), and, 42b, 43a (opposing lower side or face), and, 43b, and 44a (opposing outer side or face), and 44b. Primary channels 32a and 32b are cut into the depth of faces 41a and 41b, respectively. Springs 30a and 30b are created by cuts into the depth of faces 42a and 42b and/or 44a and 44b. Faces 43a and 43b may be left uncut depth wise. [0034] FIGURE 4 illustrates another embodiment of spring portions 30a and 30b, showing a continuous indentation in a portion of faces 42a and 42b, of chopsticks 14a and 14b, respectively, producing a region having narrower widths, 48a, and, 48b, than the width of the body, 36a and 36b, thereof at that location. Other effective spring shapes may include long, narrow sections having arc or other shapes on both sides of the chopstick, or thinning shapes or indentations only on one side of the chopsticks. [0035] FIGURE 5 illustrates another embodiment of spring portions 30a and 30b. Springs 30a and 30b may include a series of multiple, short springs which form a serrated or comb-like structure formed in one or both opposing faces 42a and 44a, and 42b and 44b, of chopsticks 14a and 14b, respectively, and generally perpendicular to faces 42a and 44a, and 42b and 44b, respectively, wherein at least one portion has a narrower width than the thickness, 36a and 36b, of sides 43a and 43b, respectively. As illustrated in FIG. 2 hereof, this reduces the stiffness of chopsticks 14a and 14b in the plane of bending and allows assembly 12 of chopsticks 14a and 14b to be flexed with the application of only a moderate squeezing force between finger 26 and thumb 28 of hand 20, and places minimal stress on joint 18, which brings grasping regions 22a and 22b together for grasping food and other objects. [0036] FIGURE 6Α shows that a pair of chopsticks 14a and 14b may be fabricated from a single piece of material such that they are readily separable along a line of weakness, 50, allowing convenient packaging and/or distribution as a unit. Retainer member 16 may be inside of or, as shown in FIG. 6Α, integral with paper or plastic packaging, 52, for chopsticks pair 10. Perforation, 54, may be included for more easily detaching retaining member 16 from packaging 52. Once retainer member 16 is wrapped around joint 18, it may be secured using adhesive patches, 56a, and, 56b, located near the ends of retainer member 16. One end of retainer 16 may be slipped into joint 18 to secure it, the remainder of retainer 16 then being wrapped around the joint, the other end being affixed with adhesive 56a or 56b. Other methods for stabilizing joint 18 may include use of adhesives in the joint itself, elastic bands, clips, and string, as examples. [0037] FIGURE 6Β is a schematic representation of a side view of attached chopsticks 12 and 14, shown in FIG. 5Α hereof. [0038] FIGURE 7 is a schematic representation of a side view of a pair of identical chopsticks 12 with joint 18 similar to the embodiments of FIGS. 1 through 6Β hereof, and illustrates that any looseness in the joint or flexibility in the material may allow chopsticks 14a and 14b to rotate apart at joint 18 if not held in place by a retaining member such as member 16 or another method for stabilizing joint 18. [0039] FIGURE 8Α is a schematic representation of an exploded perspective view of another embodiment of chopsticks 12, in which primary channels 32a and 32b, forming joint 18 are modified and augmented by side indentations, 58a, and, 60a, and, 58b, and, 60b, which form side stops, 66a, and, 68a, and, 66b, and, 68b, having widths, 75a, and, 75b, respectively, shown in FIG. 8Β, for reducing the relative rotation of the chopsticks illustrated in FIG. 7, such that a retaining member, such as retaining member 16 (illustrated in FIG. 4 hereof), is no longer required to achieve operability of joint 18 during extended use. FIGURE 8Β is a schematic representation of an enlarged, exploded perspective view of channels 32a and 32b and surrounding elements for separated chopsticks 14a and 14b of this embodiment, while FIG. 9 is a schematic representation of a perspective view of joint 18 and the surrounding elements for the attached pair of chopsticks 12 thereof. [0040] FIGURE 10Α is a schematic representation of a front view of the upper portion of chopsticks 14a and 14b as they might be fabricated from a single piece of material, wherein they are readily separable along a line of weakness, 50, while FIG. 10Β is a schematic representation of a side view of joint 18 of assembled chopsticks 12, wherein chopstick 14b is dashed to permit clear labeling of the details of chopstick 14a. FIGURES 10C and 10D are schematic representations of transverse sections cut through joint 18 at the locations denoted in FIGS. 9 and 10Β. Shallow-angled, slanted side indentations, 58a, and, 60a, are formed in faces 44a and 42a, respectively, of chopstick 14a, and shallow-angled, slanted side indentations 58b and 60b are formed in faces 44b and 42b, respectively, of chopstick 14b beginning at diagonally opposing ends of channels 32a and 32b, respectively, and ending at about the midpoint thereof, resulting in side-stops 66a and 68a, adjacent to faces 44a and 42a, respectively, at about the midpoint of channel 32a in chopstick 14a, and in side stops 66b and 68b, adjacent to faces 44a and 42a, respectively, at about the midpoint of channel 32b in chopstick 14b. When the chopsticks are assembled to form joint 18, side indentations 58a and 60a fit into primary channel 32b in chopstick 14b, side indentations 58b and 60b fit into primary channel 32a in chopstick 14a, and the face of side-stop 66a abuts the face of side-stop 68b, and the face of side-stop 66b abuts face of side-stop 68a, such that they will form an interlocking unit which holds the assembly together. The abutted faces of the side-stops compress together and prevent joint 18 from rotating apart as it otherwise could (as depicted in FIG. 7). The base members may also have have interlocking facing ribbed surfaces or other roughened surfaces located at the sides or bottom of the channels, not shown in the FIGURES, for further stabilizing the joint. Further, the dimensions of the channels and base members may be chosen to obtain a friction fit when joined together [0041] As stated hereinabove, channels 32a and 32b are formed at angles 38a and 38b, between about 15° and about 30° from axes 40a and 40b, parallel to the length of chopsticks 14a and 14b, respectively. Side-indentations are formed at angles 72a and 72b from axes 40a and 40b, such that when chopsticks 14a and 14b are joined into assembly 12 by placing opposing channels 32a and 32b together, joint 18 is formed having resultant angle 74 (FIG. 8Β and FIG. 9 hereof) between chopsticks 14a and 14b, which is equal to angles 38a and 38b plus angles 72a and 72b. [0042] Therefore, angles 72a and 72b are resultant angles from a choice of the widths (75a and 75b) of side stops 66a and 66b, and 68a and 68b, respectively. As an example: for 6 mm wide chopsticks having a chosen angle 19 of 17 °, and a chosen width for side stops 66a and 66b and 68a and 68b of 1.2 mm, results in angles 72a and 72b of approximately 3.5 degrees. [0043] Angles 38a and 38b, 72a and 72b, and 74a and 74b, and chopstick thickness 36a and 36b affect the widths 76a and 76b of base members 33a and 33b. The widths 39a and 39b of channels 32a and 32b are approximately equal to the widths 76a and 76b of base members 33a and 33b. [0044] As illustrated in FIGS. 8, 10Α, 10Β, 10C, and 10D, side indentations 58a, 60a, 58b, and 60b, and mating surfaces of channels 32a and 32b, base members 33a and 33b and side stop faces 66a, 66b, 68a, and 68b may be slightly backcut in the direction of assembly, thereby increasing the strength of the interlock holding the assembled pair together. Alternate options include a slightly undersized notch for a tight friction fit, or a series of meshing ribs and grooves, etc. The leading edges, 78a, and, 78b, 80a, and, 80b, 82a, and, 82b, 84a, and, 84b, 86a, and, 86b, and 88a, and, 88b, in the direction of assembly of channels 32a and 32b, base members 33a and 33b, and backcut side-cut faces 66a and 66b, and 68a and 68b, may be angled or radiused to facilitate the assembly of joint 18. [0045] FIGURE 11Α is a schematic representation of a perspective view looking along channel 32a at the location illustrated in FIG. 10Β hereof and more clearly illustrating the angled, back cut surfaces of the channels and base members in the embodiment, FIG. 11Β is a schematic representation of a cross section view looking along channel 32a at the location illustrated in FIG. 10Β hereof, and FIG. 11C is a schematic representation of a cross section view looking along channel 32a at the location illustrated in FIG. 10Β hereof. [0046] The remaining elements of this embodiment are similar to those described hereinabove, and illustrated in FIGS. 1-6 hereof. [0047] The foregoing description of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.
