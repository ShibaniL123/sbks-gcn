Step 5: Preparation of N-phenyl-N-(3-(3-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide (LMT-837)
A final product, N-phenyl-N-(3-(3-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide, was obtained (152mg, 58% yield) by the same method as described in Example 2 using the tert-butyl 4-(3-(3-(N-phenylpentaneamido)prop-1-ynyl)benzoyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (323 mg, 0.62 mmol) obtained in Step 4.
