Preparation of trans-N-(4-Acetamido-2-methylphenyl)-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (F1059)
To a solution of trans-N-(4-amino-2-methylphenyl)-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (DP1) (0.100 g, 0.179 mmol) and triethylamine (0.037 mL, 0.269 mmol) in dichloromethane (2.0 mL) was added acetyl chloride (0.015 g, 0.197 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with hydrochloric acid (1 N; 2×) and brine. Celite® was added to the organic layer, and the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by flash column chromatography using 0-40% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent afforded the title compound as an off-white solid (0.079 g, 73%).
