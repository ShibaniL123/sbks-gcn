SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING AND DISPLAYING TOMOSYNTHESIS IMAGE SLABS FIELD [0001] The present disclosure relates generally to breast imaging using tomosynthesis, and more specifically to systems and methods for obtaining, processing, synthesizing, storing and displaying a tomosynthesis data set or a subset thereof. In particular, the present disclosure relates to generating and displaying 2D image slabs by importing relevant data from a subset of reconstructed tomosynthesis image slices of a data set into the synthesized images. BACKGROUND [0002] Mammography has long been used to screen for breast cancer and other abnormalities. Traditionally, mammograms have been formed on x-ray film. More recently, flat panel digital imagers have been introduced that acquire a mammogram in digital form, and thereby facilitate analysis and storage of the acquired image data, and to also provide other benefits. Further, substantial attention and technological development have been dedicated to obtaining three-dimensional images of the breast using methods such as breast tomosynthesis, in contrast to the 2D images generated by legacy mammography systems, breast tomosynthesis systems construct a 3D image volume from a series of 2D projection images, each projection image obtained at a different angular displacement of an x-ray source relative to the image detector as the x-ray source is scanned over the detector. The constructed 3D image volume is typical ly presented as a plurality of slices of image data, the slices being mathematically reconstructed on planes typically parallel to the imaging detector. The reconstructed tomosynthesis slices reduce or eliminate the problems caused by tissue overlap and structure noise present in single slice, two-dimensional mammography imaging, by permitting a user (e.g., a radiologist or other medical professional) to scroll through the image slices to view only the structures in that slice. [0003] Tomosynthesis systems have recently been developed for breast cancer screening and diagnosis. In particular, Hologic, Inc. (www.hologic.com) has developed a fused, multimode mammography/tomosynthesis system that acquires one or both types of mammogram and tomosynthesis images, either while the breast remains immobilized or in different compressions of the breast. Other companies have proposed the introduction of systems which are dedicated to tomosynthesis imaging; i.e., which do not include the ability to also acquire a mammogram in the same compression. [0004] Examples of systems and methods that leverage existing medical expertise in order to facilitate, optionally, the transition to tomosynthesis technology are described in U.S. Patent No. 7,760,924, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In particular, U.S. Patent No. 7,760,924 describes a method of generating a synthesized 2D image, which may be displayed along with tomosynthesis projection or reconstructed images, in order to assist in screening and diagnosis. [0005] While a 2D image synthesized from the entire tomosynthesis data set provides a useful overview of the image data that is similar to a traditional mammography image, a single 2D image may contain too much data to facilitate optimal screening and diagnosis. Accordingly, there exists a need for tomosynthesis systems and methods for more effectively processing, synthesizing and displaying tomosynthesis image data. SUMMARY [0006] In accordance with various embodiments, a system for processing breast tissue images includes an image processing computer, and a user interface operatively coupled to the image processing computer, wherein the image processing computer is configured to obtain image data of breast tissue, processing the image data to generate a set of reconstructed image slices, the reconstructed image slices collectively depicting the breast tissue, process respective subsets of the reconstructed image slices to generate a set of image slabs, each image slab comprising a synthesized 2D image of a portion of the breast tissue obtained from a respective subset of the set of reconstructed image slices. The system may further comprise at least one image display monitor, wherein the image processing computer is further configured to cause to be displayed on a same or different display monitor of the one or more display monitors one or more image slabs of the generated set of image slabs. In various embodiments, the image processing computer is further configured to generate a storage file comprising the generated set of image slabs. [0007] In one embodiment, the image processing computer is configured to generate each image slab of the set from a predetermined number of successive reconstructed image slices, wherein adjacent image slabs of the set include a predetermined overlap number of successive reconstructed image slices. In another embodiment, the image processing computer is configured to generate each image slab of the set from a user inputted number of successive reconstructed image slices, wherein adjacent image slabs of the set include a user inputted overlap number of successive reconstructed image slices. In one embodiment, respective slabs are generated from six successive image slabs, and wherein adjacent image slabs of the set include an overlap of three successive reconstructed image slices. [0008] In various embodiments, the image slabs are generated using an enhancement mechanism that is selected or modified based on a number of reconstructed image slices from which the respective image slab is generated. By way of non-limiting example, the enhancement mechanism may be selected or modified based on a value corresponding to the number of reconstructed image slices from which the respective image slab is generated. By way of another non- limiting example, the enhancement mechanism may comprise highlighting one or more objects or regions in one or more image slabs of the set. In various embodiments, the enhancement mechanism takes into account one or more of: (i) a binary map of the respective highlighted objects or regions; (ii) a map of each image slice that includes a probability distribution for an identified pattern in the respective highlighted objects or regions; and (iii) importing an identified object or region from an image slice of the respective subset of reconstructed images slices into the image slab, wherein the object or region is imported into the image slab at X, Y coordinate locations corresponding to X, Y coordinate locations of the object or region in the respective reconstructed image slice. [0009] In another embodiment of the disclosed inventions, a method for processing breast tissue image data includes obtaining image data of breast tissue, processing the image data to generate a set of reconstructed image slices, the reconstructed image slices collectively depicting the breast tissue, and processing respective subsets of the reconstructed image slices to generate a set of image slabs, each image slab of the set including a synthesized 2D image of a portion of the breast tissue obtained from a respective subset of the set of reconstructed image slices. In some embodiments, the slabs are generated from a predetermined number of successive image slices, and successive image slabs are generated from a predetermined overlap of image slices. In other embodiments, the slabs are generated from a user inputted number of successive image slices, and successive image slabs may be generated from a user inputted overlap of image slices. In one embodiment, respective slabs are generated from six successive image slabs, and wherein adjacent image slabs of the set include an overlap of three successive reconstructed image slices. [00010] In various embodiments, the image slabs are generated using an enhancement mechanism (i.e., an image processing/synthesis function) that is selected or modified based on a number of reconstructed image slices from which the respective image slab is generated. The enhancement mechanism may be selected or modified based on a previously determined value corresponding to the number of reconstructed image slices from which the respective image slab is generated. The enhancement mechanism may be selected or modified based on a value determined based upon the number of reconstructed image slices from which the respective image slab is generated. The enhancement mechanism may include highlighting object(s) and/or regions in the respective image slabs. The enhancement mechanism may take into account a binary map of the object or region. The enhancement mechanism may take into account a map of each reconstructed image slice that includes a probability distribution for an identified pattern in the object or region. The enhancement mechanism may include importing an identified object or region from a reconstructed image slice of the respective subset into the image slab. By way of non-limiting example, the object(s) or region(s) may be imported into the image slab at X, Y coordinate locations corresponding to X, Y coordinate locations of the respective object(s) or region(s) in the respective reconstructed image slice(s). [00011] In yet another embodiment, a method for processing breast tissue image data includes (i) obtaining image data of breast tissue, (ii) processing the image data to generate a set of reconstructed image slices collectively depicting the breast tissue, (iii) displaying a plurality of reconstructed image slices to a user, (iv) receiving user input identifying an image slice of the set, and (v) processing a subset of the image slices to generate an image slab comprising a synthesized 2D image of a portion of the breast tissue obtained from the subset of reconstructed image slices including the user-identified image slice. By way of non- limiting example, the slab may be generated from a user inputted number of successive image slices. The method may also include processing respective subsets of the reconstructed image slices to generate a user-inputted number of image slabs, each image slab including a synthesized 2D image of a portion of the breast tissue obtained from the respective subset of reconstructed image slices, and wherein successive image slabs of the plurality are generated from a user inputted overlap of reconstructed image slices.

[00025] Various embodiments of the disclosed inventions are described hereinafter with reference to the figures. It should be noted that the figures are not drawn to scale and that elements of similar structures or functions are represented by like reference numerals throughout the figures. It should also be noted that the figures are only intended to facilitate the description of the embodiments. They are not intended as an exhaustive description of the disclosed inventions, which is defined only by the appended claims and their equivalents. In addition, an illustrated embodiment of the disclosed inventions needs not have all the aspects or advantages shown. An aspect, feature or advantage described in conjunction with a particular embodiment of the disclosed inventions is not necessarily limited to that embodiment and can be practiced in any other embodiments even if not so illustrated. [00026] For the following defined terms and abbreviations, these definitions shall be applied throughout this patent specification and the accompanying claims, unless a different definition is given in the claims or elsewhere in this specification: [00027] Acquired image refers to an image generated while visualizing a woman's breast tissue. Acquired images can be generated by radiation from a radiation source impacting on a radiation detector disposed on opposite sides of the breast tissue, as in a conventional mammogram. [00028] Reconstructed image refers to an image generated from data derived from a plurality of acquired images. A reconstructed image simulates an acquired image not included in the plurality of acquired images. [00029] Synthesized image refers to an artificial image generated from data derived from a plurality of acquired and/or reconstructed images. A synthesized image includes elements (e.g., objects and regions) from the acquired and/or reconstructed images, but does not necessarily correspond to an image that can be acquired during visualization. Synthesized images are constructed analysis tools. [00030] Mp refers to a conventional mammogram or contrast enhanced mammogram, which are two-dimensional (2D) projection images of a breast, and encompasses both a digital image as acquired by a flat panel detector or another imaging device, and the image after conventional processing to prepare it for display (e.g., to a health professional), storage (e.g., in the PACS system of a hospital), and/or other use. [00031] Tp refers to an image that is similarly two-dimensional (2D), but is acquired at a respective tomosynthesis angle between the breast and the origin of the imaging x rays (typically the focal spot of an x-ray tube), and encompasses the image as acquired, as well as the image data after being processed for display, storage, and/or other use. [00032] Tr refers to an image that is reconstructed from tomosynthesis projection images Tp, for example, in the manner described in one or more of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,577,282, 7,606,801, 7,760,924, and 8,571,289, the respective disclosures of which are fully incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, wherein a Tr image represents a slice of the breast as it would appear in a projection x ray image of that slice at any desired angle, not only at an angle used for acquiring Tp or Mp images. [00033] Ms refers to a synthesized 2D projection image, which simulates mammography images, such as a craniocaudal (CC) or mediolateral oblique (MLO) images, and is constructed using tomosynthesis projection images Tp, tomosynthesis reconstructed images Tr, or a combination thereof. Ms images may be provided for display to a health professional or for storage in the PACS system of a hospital or another institution. Examples of methods that may be used to generate Ms images are described in the above -referenced U.S. Patent Nos. 7,760,924 and 8,571,289. [00034] IMERGE refers to a synthesized 2D image constructed by importing into a single image one or more objects and/or regions from any two or more of Mp, Ms, Tp or Tr images of a woman's breast, wherein an image from which an object or region is imported into the merged image comprises a source image for that object or region, and wherein objects or regions are imported into the merged image at X, Y coordinate locations corresponding to the X, Y coordinate locations of the objects or regions in their respective source image. Examples of methods that may be used to generate IMERGE images are described in PCT Application Nos. PCT/US2012/066526 and PCT/US2013/025993, the respective disclosures of which are fully incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. [00035] The terms IMERGE, Tp, Tr, Ms and Mp each encompasses information, in whatever form, that is sufficient to describe the respective image for display, further processing, or storage. The respective IMERGE, Mp, Ms. Tp and Tr images are typically provided in digital form prior to being displayed, with each image being defined by information that identifies the properties of each pixel in a two-dimensional array of pixels. The pixel values typically relate to respective measured, estimated, or computed responses to X-rays of corresponding volumes in the breast, i.e., voxels or columns of tissue. In one embodiment, the geometry of the tomosynthesis images (Tr and Tp), mammography images (Ms and Mp) and merged images (IMERGE) are matched to a common coordinate system, as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,702,142, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Unless otherwise specified, such coordinate system matching is assumed to be implemented with respect to the embodiments described in the ensuing detailed description of this patent specification. [00036] The terms "generating an image" and "transmitting an image" respectively refer to generating and transmitting information that is sufficient to describe the image for display. The generated and transmitted information is typically digital information. [00037] FIG. 1 illustrates the flow of data in an exemplary image generation and display system, which incorporates merged image generation and display technology. It should be understood that, while FIG. 1 illustrates a particular embodiment of a flow diagram with certain processes taking place in a particular serial order or in parallel, the claims and various other embodiments are not limited to the performance of the image processing steps in any particular order, unless so specified. [00038] More particularly, the image generation and display system includes an image acquisition system 1 that acquires tomosynthesis image data for generating Tp images of a woman's breast(s), using the respective three dimensional and/or tomosynthesis acquisition methods of any of the currently available systems. If the acquisition system is a combined tomosynthesis/mammography system, Mp images may also be generated. Some dedicated tomosynthesis systems or combined tomosynthesis/ mammography systems may be adapted to accept and store legacy mammogram images, (indicated by a dashed line and legend Mpiegacy in FIG. 1) in a storage device 2, which is preferably a DICOM-compliant Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) storage device. Following acquisition, the tomosynthesis projection images Tp may also be transmitted to the storage device 2 (as shown in FIG. 1). [00039] The Tp images are transmitted from either the acquisition system 1, or from the storage device 2, or both, to a computer system configured as a reconstruction engine 3 that reconstructs the Tp images into reconstructed image "slices" Tr, representing breast slices of selected thickness and at selected orientations, as described in the above-referenced patents and applications. The imaging and display system 1 further includes a 2D synthesizer 4 that operates substantially in parallel with the reconstruction engine 3 for generating 2D images that simulate mammograms taken at any orientation (e.g., CC or MLO) using a combination of one or more Tp and/or Tr images. The synthesized 2D images may be generated dynamically prior to display (as shown in FIG. 1) or may be stored in storage system 2 for later use. The synthesized 2D images are interchangeably referenced as IMERGE, T2d and Ms. The reconstruction engine 3 and 2D synthesizer 4 are preferably connected to a display system 5 via a fast transmission link. The originally acquired Mp and/or Tp images may also be forwarded to the display system 5 for concurrent or toggled viewing with the respective IMERGE, Tr, and/or Ms images by a user. [00040] Mode filters 7a, 7b are disposed between image acquisition and image display. Each of the filters 7a and 7b may additionally include customized filters for each type of image (i.e., Tp, Mp, and Tr) arranged to identify and highlight certain aspects of the respective image types. In this manner, each imaging mode can be tuned or configured in an optimal way for a specific purpose. The tuning or configuration may be automatic, based on the type of the image, or may be defined by manual input, for example through a user interface coupled to a display. In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 1 , the filters 7a and 7b are selected to highlight particular characteristics of the images that are best displayed in respective imaging modes, for example, geared towards highlighting masses or calcifications, or for making the merged images (described below) appear to be a particular image type, such as a 3D reconstructed slice, or a 2D mammogram. [00041] According to one embodiment of the disclosed inventions, and as described in greater detail herein, the system 1 includes an image merge processor 6 that merges relevant image data obtained from a set of available source and synthesized images of a woman's breast(s) to provide one or more merged 2D images ("slab" or IMERGE) for display. The set of available images used to generate the merged images ("slab" or IMERGE) may include filtered and/or unfiltered Ms, Mp, Tr and/or Tp images. While FIG. 1 depicts all these types of images being input into the image merge processor 6, it is also envisioned within the scope of the disclosed inventions that the merged images may be manually configurable. For example, a user interface or preset configuration may be provided and configured to allow a user to select a particular group of two or more images or image types for generating a synthesized 2D image "slab" or IMERGE for display. [00042] By way of illustration, a user, such as a radiologist or other medical professional, may wish to merge two or more reconstructed tomosynthesis slices (Tr) in order to provide a merged image showing the most readily discerned structures in the collective tomosynthesis image data in a displayed synthesized 2D image ("slab" or IMERGE), which essentially maps the tomosynthesis slices at a pixel wise granularity. Additionally or alternatively, the user may combine a 2D mammogram image, whether Mp or Ms, with a 3D projection (Tp), or with selected reconstructed images (Tr), in order to obtain a customized merged image ("slab" or IMERGE) that highlights both calcifications and various tissue structures in the breast. Filters applied to each type of image can further highlight the types of structures or features in a merged image that are generally most prevalent or most readily discerned in the respective source image type. Thus, one type of filter may be applied to mammography images to highlight calcifications, while a different filter may be applied to tomosynthesis slices to highlight masses, allowing both the highlighted calcifications and highlighted tissue masses to be displayed in a single merged image. Filters may also provide a merged image with a desired look and feel; i.e., to make a merged image appear more like a tomosynthesis or mammography image. [00043] The display system 5 may be part of a standard acquisition workstation (e.g., of acquisition system 1), or of a standard (multi-display) review station (not shown) that is physically remote from the acquisition system 1. In some embodiments, a display connected via a communication network may be used, for example, a display of a personal computer or of a so-called tablet, smart phone or other hand-held device. In any event, the display 5 of the system is preferably able to display IMERGE, MS, Mp, Tr, and/or Tp images concurrently, e.g., in separate side-by-side monitors of a review workstation, although the invention may still be implemented with a single display monitor, by toggling between images. [00044] To facilitate the detection/diagnosis process, Tr slices are preferably reconstructed all to the same size for display, which can be the same as the size of an Mp or Ms image of the breast, or they can be initially reconstructed to sizes determined by the fan shape of the x ray beam used in the acquisition, and then later converted to that same size by appropriate interpolation and/or extrapolation. In this manner, images of different types and from different sources can be displayed in desirable size and resolution. For example, an image can be displayed in (1) Fit To View Port mode, in which the size of the displayed image size is maximized such that the entire imaged breast tissue is visible, (2) True Size mode, in which a display pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image, or (3) Right Size mode, in which the size of a displayed image is adjusted so that it matches that of another image being concurrently displayed, or with which the displayed image is, or can be, toggled. [00045] For example, if two images of the same breast are taken and are not the same size, or do not have the same resolution, provisions may be made to automatically or user- selectively increase or reduce the magnification (i.e., "zoom in" or "zoom out") of one or both images, such that they appear to be the same size when they are concurrently displayed, or as a user toggles between the images. Known interpolation, extrapolation and/or weighting techniques can be used to accomplish the re-sizing process, and known image processing technology can also be used to make other characteristics of the displayed images similar in a way that facilitates detection/diagnosis. When viewing such resized images, according to one embodiment of the disclosed inventions, the merged images ("slab" or IMERGE) are automatically resized, accordingly. [00046] Thus, the system 1, which is described as for purposes of illustration and not limitation in this patent specification, is capable of receiving and selectively displaying tomosynthesis projection images Tp, tomosynthesis reconstruction images Tr, synthesized mammogram images Ms, and/or mammogram (including contrast mammogram) images Mp, or any one or sub combination of these image types. The system 1 employs software to convert (i.e., reconstruct) tomosynthesis images Tp into images Tr, software for synthesizing mammogram images Ms, and software for merging a set of images to provide a set of merged images ("slabs" or IMERGE) each of which displays, for every region of the merged image, the most relevant feature in that region among all images in the source image set. For the purpose of this patent specification, an object of interest or feature in a source image may be considered a 'most relevant' feature for inclusion in a merged image based upon the application of one or more CAD algorithms to the collective source images, wherein the CAD algorithms assign numerical values, weights or thresholds, to pixels or regions of the respective source images based upon identified/detected objects and features of interest within the respective region or between features or, in instances when the merged images are generated directly from the synthesized image without CAD assistance, simply the pixel value, weight or other threshold associated with a pixel or region of the image. The objects and features of interest may include, for example, spiculated lesions, calcifications, and the like. Various systems and methods are currently well known for computerized detection of abnormalities in radiographic images, such as those described by Giger et al. in RadioGraphics, May 1993, pp. 647-656; Giger et al. in Proceedings of SPIE, Vol. 1445 (1991), pp. 101-103; and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,907,156, 5,133,020, 5,343,390, and 5,491,627, each of which being hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. [00047] FIG. 2 is a diagram which pictorially illustrates the merging of image data from a set of tomosynthesis reconstruction images (Tr), comprising tomosynthesis slices 10A to 10N, to generate a synthetic merged image ("slab" or IMERGE) 30. For ease of description, filters are not shown in this example. The tomosynthesis image data set (Tr) are forwarded to the region compare and image merge processor 6, which evaluates each of the source images 1 OA- 10N for which a plurality of merged images is to be generated (i.e., whether automatically, or based on a specific user command) in order to (1) identify the objects and features of interest in each image for those that may be considered a 'most relevant' feature for possible inclusion in one or more merged images 30 based upon the application of one or more CAD algorithms (as described above), (2) identifies respective pixel regions in the images 1 OA- 10N that contain the identified features, and (3) thereafter compares the images on a region by region basis, searching for that image 1 OA- 10N with the most desirable display data for each respective region. [00048] As discussed above, the image 1 OA- ION with the most desirable display data may be an image with a highest pixel value, a lowest pixel value, or which has been assigned a threshold value or weight based on the application of a CAD algorithm to the image 1 OA- ION. When the image 1 OA- 10N with the most desirable display data for that region is identified, the pixels of that region are copied over to the corresponding region of the one or more merged image 30. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, region 35Tr of tomosynthesis slice 10A is copied to region 351 of a merged image 30. In a similar manner, region 36Tr of tomosynthesis slice 10B is copied to region 361 of the merged image 30. Optionally, the region compare and image merge processor 6 can generate an index map 40 identifying the source images 10A, 10B of the objects 351, 361 in the merged image 30. Although the regions of FIG. 2 are shown as pre-defined grid regions, it is not necessary that regions be pre-defined in this manner. Rather, according to one embodiment of the disclosed inventions, the boundaries of the regions may be dynamically identified during the region compare and image generation process by performing comparisons at pixel or multi-pixel granularities. [00049] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, a plurality of merged images ("slabs" or IMERGE) 30 are synthesized from a set or stack of reconstructed Tr images ("slices") 10. For instance, 11 merged image slabs 30 are generated from a stack including 60 reconstructed Tr slices ΙΟι-ΙΟδο, which is divided into 11 overlapping subsets of Tr slices 10 (only slices 10i- 102o and slabs 30i-303 are shown for clarity). The first merged image slab 30i is synthesized from Tr slices I O1-I O10, the second merged image slab 302 is synthesized from Tr slices 106- I O15, the third merged image slab 303 is synthesized from Tr slices 10n-102o, etc. This pattern is repeated until the eleventh merged image slab 30n is synthesized from Tr slices I O51-I O60. In this embodiment, the default pattern of merged image slabs 30 includes a 10 slice thickness (i.e., N = 10 in FIG. 2) with a 5 slice overlap between adjacent slabs 30. For a stack having a number of Tr slices 10 not divisible by 10, the merged image slabs 30 at one end of the stack can have a different number of Tr slices 10 per slab 30 and/or a different overlap with the adjacent slab 30. [00050] While, the foregoing described embodiment has a specific default pattern of merged image slabs 30, the invention encompasses any number of Tr slices 10 per slab 30, any amount of overlap between adjacent slabs 30, and any size stack. By way of non-limiting examples: in one embodiment, there are six Tr slices 10 per slab 30, with a with a three slice overlap between adjacent slabs. In another embodiment, there are eight Tr slices per slab 30, with a four slice overlap between adjacent slabs. In still another embodiment, there are fifteen Tr slices 10 per slab 30, with a ten slice overlap between adjacent slabs. In particular, the amount of overlapping Tr slices 10 in adjacent slabs 30 need not be exactly or approximately half of the respective slab size, but can be any number of Tr slices 10 selected by the operator. [00051] In another embodiment, the system may display a user interface configured to receive input from a user. The user input may include a number of Tr slices 10 per slab 30, an amount of overlap between adjacent slabs 30, and a stack size. The system generates the plurality of slabs 30 based on the user input. In yet another embodiment with a user interface, the user input may include a Tr slice number (e.g., 1026) and a number of slices (e.g., five), and the system then generates a single slab 30 based on this user input. The slab 30 is generated from a subset of Tr slices 10 centered on the Tr slice corresponding to the user provided Tr slice number with the provided number of slices on each side of the center Tr slice (e.g., 1020-103i). While two types of user input have been described, other types of user input are encompassed by the claims. [00052] In still further embodiments, the number of Tr slices 10 per slab 30, the amount of overlap between adjacent slabs 30, and/or the respective stack size are preset values, and the slabs are automatically generated according to the preset values without requiring user input. In some such "auto-mapping" embodiments, it may still be possible for the user to override any of the preset slab size, slice overlap amount, and stack size values. [00053] FIG. 3 illustrates a merged image 50, which has been constructed via the combinations of numerous regions 52 of different source images (Tr tomosynthesis slices TrA, TrB, Trf and Trx), at arbitrary region boundaries, for example, which may be identified according to the detection of particular features within the respective source images ΤΓΑ, TrB, Trf and Trx. While the merged images 30 and 50 depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3 are generated from tomosynthesis reconstruction images or "slices" (Tr), merged images can be generated from tomosynthesis projection images Tp, tomosynthesis reconstruction images Tr, synthesized mammogram images Ms, and/or mammogram (including contrast mammogram) images Mp. [00054] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram provided to illustrate exemplary steps that may be performed in an image merge process carried out in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosed inventions. At step 62, an image data set is acquired. The image data set may be acquired by a tomosynthesis acquisition system, a combination tomosynthesis/mammography system, or by retrieving pre-existing image data from a storage device, whether locally or remotely located relative to an image display device. At step 64, a user may optionally select a merge mode, wherein the user may designate (1) which images are to be used for the source image set to generate one or more merged images, (2) whether to highlight certain features in the merged images, such as calcifications, spiculated lesions or masses, and (3) whether to display the image as a lower resolution tomosynthesis image, etc. At step 66, the images that are to be merged to generate the merged images are mapped to a common coordinate system, for example, as described in the above-referenced U.S. Patent No. 7,702,142. Other methods of matching images of different coordinate systems may alternatively be used. At step 72, the process of comparing regions among the different images begins. At step 74, each IMERGE region is populated with the pixels of the region of an image from the source image set having the most desirable pixels, value, or pattern. The process of populating regions continues until it is determined, at step 76, that all regions have been evaluated, at which point the merged images are ready for display. [00055] Once the merged images are generated, they may be used to assist in the navigation through a tomosynthesis image data stack from which the merge image was generated. Such navigation is a two-step process comprising selection of various objects of interest, and display of corresponding tomosynthesis images that are the source of such objects of interest in one or more of the merged images. By way of example, FIG. 5A and Fig. 5B illustrate two views of a display 80. The first view of display 80 shown in FIG. 5A illustrates a merged image 82, having regions sourced by different ones of an acquired or synthesized image set. FIG. 5B illustrates a particular feature enabled by the disclosed inventions, whereby a user may select a region or area 83 within the merged image 82, and the resulting image source 84 for that area is presented to the user. [00056] The disclosed embodiments may employ many different mechanisms for selection of the objects of interest and corresponding display of the respective source images corresponding; although it is to be understood that the disclosed inventions are not limited to those described herein. For example, the selection of a region or area within a merged image may include a selection of a CAD mark, or alternatively a selection of a particular feature of interest to the reviewer. Navigating tomosynthesis image data using a merged image is detailed in the above -referenced PCT Application Nos. PCT/US2012/066526 and PCT/US2013/025993. [00057] It will be appreciated that the disclosed and described systems and methods in this patent specification are designed to condense the image information made available from a tomosynthesis reconstruction volume (or "stack") containing 3D breast image data down to a set of synthesized 2D images, similar to conventional 2D mammographic images. By reviewing these synthesized 2D images concurrently with or without the 3D tomosynthesis stack, it is possible to provide a much more efficient and accurate review of the breast tissue. In embodiments with concurrent review, the synthesized 2D merged images can act as a guidance-map, so that the user reviewing the images can focus on the synthesized 2D images for detecting any objects or regions of interest that merit further review, and the system can provide immediate, automated navigation to a "best" corresponding tomosynthesis image slice (or a subset of adjacent tomosynthesis slices) to allow the user to conduct this further review to verify and evaluate the finding. Thus, it is preferred, although not required for practicing all embodiments, for the user to employ a user interface that can display a respective synthesized 2D merged image along-side the tomosynthesis volume image slices, for concurrent viewing of both. [00058] The plurality of 2D and/or 3D images from which the synthesized 2D images are generated may include tomosynthesis projection images, tomosynthesis reconstruction slices, mammography images, contrast enhanced mammography images, synthesized 2D images, and combinations thereof. It will be appreciated that the synthesized 2D images advantageously incorporate the most relevant information from each of the underlying acquired and computer generated image data sets of the respective breast. Thus, different regions of pixels in the displayed synthesized 2D images may be sourced from corresponding different images in the underlying image data set, depending on which underlying image is best for viewing an object of interest, e.g., a mass or a calcification, in the respective region. The particular regions may be identified statically, i.e., within a particular grid, or dynamically, i.e., based on identified objects of interest, and may range in granularity from as little as one pixel, to all pixels in the respective image. In one embodiment, priority is given to first importing into a merged image under construction those regions containing one or more specific tissue structures of interest in the images of a tomosynthesis image data set (or "stack"), and thereafter populating the remaining regions of the merged image with the otherwise most relevant regions from the images, as described above. [00059] The user interface may additionally include features to enable the user to manipulate the presented tomosynthesis data, for example, to allow the user to scan through adjacent image slices of the tomosynthesis stack, or to further zoom (magnify) into a selected region, to place markers, or alternatively to apply filters or other image processing techniques to the image data. In this manner, the user may quickly review a large stack of tomosynthesis data by utilizing the synthesized 2D images for navigation purposes, thereby increasing the performance and efficiency of breast cancer screening and diagnosis. According to another embodiment, it has been determined or otherwise appreciated that particular types of images may include or be superior for viewing different types of relevant information. For example, calcifications are typically best visualized in 2D mammograms, while masses are typically best visualized using 3D reconstructed images. [00060] Thus, in one embodiment, different filters are applied to each of the different types of underlying 2D and/or 3D images in the image data set used to generate the merged images, the filters selected to highlight particular characteristics of the images that are best displayed in the respective imaging modes. Appropriate filtering of the images prior to generating the merged images helps ensure that the final merged images include the most relevant information that can be obtained from all the underlying image types. Additionally and/or alternatively, the type of filtering performed for the various images may be defined via user input, which permits a user to select a 'merge mode', for example, geared towards highlighting masses, calcifications, or for making the merged images appear to be a particular image type, such as a 3D reconstructed slice, or a 2D mammogram. [00061] Synthesizing the 2D images may be accomplished in a variety of ways. For example, in one embodiment, general purpose image filtering algorithms are used to identify features within each of the respective source 2D and 3D images, and a user may select whether to use 2D filtered data and/or 3D filtered data to generate the merged images. Alternatively, 2D or 3D filtered data may be automatically selected in accordance with a particular visualization mode that has been user selected; for example, 2D filtered data may be automatically selected by the system for calcification visualization mode, while 3D filtered data may be automatically selected by the system for mass visualization modes. In one embodiment, two different sets of merged images may be constructed, one for each mode; alternatively, a single set of merged images may be constructed that takes into account the respective filtered image data results from all available image types. [00062] In one embodiment, features (representing potential objects of interest) are identified in the available source images and thereafter weighted, e.g., on a pixel by pixel or region by region basis in each respective image. A 2D image is then constructed by incorporating the respective regions having the most significant weight in individual images of the available source images. The size of the region may vary in granularity from one pixel to many (or even all) pixels of the respective image, and may be statically pre-defined, or may have margins that vary in accordance with the varying thresholds of the source images. The synthesized (aka "merged") image may be pre-processed and stored as a DICOM object following tomosynthesis acquisition, and thereafter forwarded with the reconstruction data for subsequent review by a user. Such an arrangement removes the need to forward weighting information for each reconstructed slice. Alternatively, the stored DICOM object may include the weighting information, allowing the merged images to be dynamically constructed in response to a request for synthesized 2D images at the user's work station. In one embodiment, both the weighting information and the synthesized 2D image may be provided in the DICOM object, allowing presentation of a default set of merged images, while still enabling customization according to the personal workflow of the reviewer. To be clear, the weighting information can be stored with the image itself, and need not be a separate file. [00063] The weighing or enhancement of features in the source images may be modified based on the number of Tr slices from which synthetic IMERGE slabs are generated. For instance, a factor, coefficient, value, or weight used to weigh a feature in a source image may result in more weighing of the feature in a Tr slice when the slab is to be generated from 30 slices, when compared to the weighing of the same feature in the same Tr slice when the slab is to be generated from 10 slices. Further, the selection of features to be weighed may be modified based on the number of Tr slices from which synthetic IMERGE slabs are generated. For instance, more features may be weighed or enhanced when more a slab is generated from more slices. The weighing factors can be predetermined and stored in a look-up table in the system. Alternatively, the weighing factors can be empirically or mathematically determined from the number of Tr slices from which synthetic IMERGE slabs are to be generated. In this manner, the features from the source Tr slices can be enhanced in the synthetic IMERGE slabs. The synthetic IMERGE slabs can present enriched information by combining clinically relevant features from multiple Tr slices and highlighting same. Such slabs can be used to drive further image processing and analytics, and provide enhanced data review performance and increase efficiency and throughput. [00064] It is realized that the visualization of the synthesized 2D images may have some drawbacks. For example, there may be neighboring regions in a merged image which exhibit bright calcifications, but which in fact are sourced from image slices that are distant from one another in the z plane. Therefore, what may appear to be a cluster of micro-calcifications in a 2D image may, in fact, be individual calcifications that are distributed (i.e., along the z-axis) throughout the breast and thus do not actually represent a micro-calcification cluster that requires further review. Thus, according to another embodiment, a 'cluster spread indicator' may be provided with the synthesized 2D image, which visually indicates the distribution of calcifications along the z-plane, allowing the user to quickly assess whether a group of calcifications comprise a calcification cluster. [00065] The synthesized 2D images are displayed to the user of the described system (e.g., the medical professional or the radiologist), typically on a workstation having side-by-side monitors as depicted in FIG. 5B. Depending on how the user has configured the workstation, when initiating review of particular person's breast image data, only the synthesized 2D images may be presented, e.g., on the left-hand-side monitor, with the right-hand-side monitor being blank, or perhaps depicting a first or middle image slice from the tomosynthesis stack, preferably depending on a user-selectable configuration. In one embodiment, the system will initially and serially display the synthesized 2D images on the left-hand-side monitor, and a "most relevant" one of the tomosynthesis slice images on the right-hand-side monitor, which was determined by the system based upon the displayed tomosynthesis slice being most similar in appearance to each synthesized 2D image, or having the relatively most interesting objects, out of the tomosynthesis image stack for the entire breast volume. [00066] As noted above, in various embodiments, an object or region may be automatically highlighted in the synthesized 2D image and/or displayed at least portion of the one or more images from the plurality. Additionally and/or alternatively, an object or region in the synthesized 2D image and/or displayed at least portion of the one or more images from the plurality may be highlighted in response to a further received user command or to certain user activity detected through the user interface. By way of non-limiting example, an object or region may is highlighted by a contour line representing a boundary of the highlighted object or region. Preferably, the object or region is highlighted in a manner indicating that the highlighted object or region is or contains a specified type of tissue structure. [00067] While the system processes a subset of Tr slices to generate an IMERGE slab, it can incorporate additional information designed to target/highlight certain objects, lesions or regions. The information used to target/highlight these objects can be imported in various forms, such as a binary map of identified objects or regions, or as a continuous map including the probability distribution for certain patterns. [00068] By way of illustration, FIG. 6 depicts an exemplary work station display 122, including a left-hand side monitor 124 ("C-View") displaying one 132 of a plurality of synthesized 2D images of a woman's breast. The synthesized 2D image 132 includes a highlighted tissue structure 134, wherein the highlighting is in the form of a contour line that represents a boundary of the tissue structure. This highlighting may have been done automatically by the system, e.g., at the time the 2D image 132 is initially displayed, or only in response to a specific user command or indication, e.g., by hovering a pointer over the object 134 in the 2D image 132. The work station display 122 also includes a right-hand side monitor 126 displaying the respective tomosynthesis image 136 (which is slice no. 18 of the tomosynthesis volume stack, as indicated in the lower right hand side of the monitor 126), which is the source image or which otherwise provides a most similar view of the highlighted tissue structure 134 as seen in the synthesized image 132. In particular, the user interface associated with the display 122 allows for a user to select or otherwise indicate a location on the synthesized 2D image 132, e.g., by displaying a pointer, a cross, a circle, or other similar geometrical object, and then input a certain command type (e.g., mouse click) that will be recognized by the system as a request from the user to have the corresponding source or otherwise most similar tomosynthesis slice(s) depicting the region or object underlying the pointer displayed in monitor 126. [00069] FIG. 7 depicts the work station display 122, wherein a different one 142 of the plurality of synthesized 2D breast images is displayed in the left-hand side C-View monitor 124. The synthesized 2D image 142 includes a highlighted tissue structure 144, wherein the highlighting is in the form of a geometric shape, in this case a circle, to indicate that the object 144 is a spiculated mass. Again, this highlighting may have been done automatically by the system, e.g., at the time the 2D image 142 is initially displayed, or only in response to a specific user command or indication, e.g., by hovering a pointer over the object 144 in the 2D image 142. The right-hand side monitor 126 is displaying the respective tomosynthesis image 146 (which is slice no. 33 of the tomosynthesis volume stack, as indicated in the lower right hand side of the monitor 126), which is the source image or which otherwise provides a most similar view of the highlighted tissue structure 144 as seen in the synthesized image 132. [00070] It should be appreciated that there will be instances in which the mapping between an object or region in a merged 2D image to the respective object or region in the displayed (i.e., source or "best") image may not necessarily be 1-to-l, and will possibly be "1 -to-many" in certain circumstances, for example, when multiple line structures on different tomosynthesis image slices combine together to form a line-crossing structures in the synthesized 2D image. By way of example, FIG. 8 depicts the user work station display 122, including the same synthesized 2D breast image 142 as displayed in FIG. 7, but now highlighting a region 154 containing micro-calcifications, with the right-hand side monitor displaying the tomosynthesis image slice 156 (which is slice no. 29 of the tomosynthesis volume stack, as indicated in the lower right hand side of the monitor 126), from which the highlighted region 154 was imported into the 2D image 142, or which otherwise provides a best view of the micro -calcifications. In particular, because the spiculated mass structure 144 and region of micro-calcifications 154 are in very close proximity in FIG. 8, a different one may be highlighted depending on a specific user command (e.g., to highlight a certain tissue type), or by slight adjustment of the position of the pointer of the user interface. [00071] The above described examples with respect to FIGS. 6-8 are readily accomplished by index maps or a full 3D map constructed at the same time (or after - depending on the system implementation) the synthesized 2D images are generated, as described in above- referenced PCT Application Nos. PCT/US2012/066526 and PCT/US2013/025993. Alternatively, if no index map or full 3D map is available, for any given such user selected/specified point/location on the 2D image displayed in the left-hand-side monitor 124, the system may execute an algorithm to automatically compute the best corresponding image (i.e., X, Y and Z) within the tomosynthesis stack for display on the right-hand-side monitor 126. A "tomosynthesis slice indicator" may optionally be provided on the left-hand-side monitor 124, which indicates which tomosynthesis slice number (numbers) would be displayed on the right-hand- side monitor 126 based on a current location of a user curser on the 2D image. With this feature, the user need not be distracted by constantly changing image displays on the right-hand-side monitor 126, while still providing the reviewer with an understanding of the z-axis location in the tomosynthesis volume stack of a particular object in a 2D image. [00072] In accordance with one embodiment of the disclosed inventions, the available features of the user interface may be extended to function, not only based on a point/location in a merged image, but also based, in a similar fashion, on a structure/object/region in a merged image. For example, particular objects or regions in a merged image may be automatically highlighted when displayed, based on the system recognition of possible interest in the respective objects, or of objects located in the respective regions. In one embodiment, shown in FIG. 8, this highlighting is in the form of a contour line 108 that represents a boundary of a highlighted tissue structure. A contour line may be similarly used to highlight regions of interest in the displayed image, e.g., containing a number of calcification structures. In some embodiments, the system is configured to allow the user to "draw" a contour line on the merged images as a way of selecting or otherwise indicating an object or region of interest for causing the system to concurrently display one or more underlying source images of the selected or indicated object or region. [00073] In other embodiments, the system employs known image processing techniques to identify different breast tissue structures in the various source images, and highlight them in the merged images, in particular, tissue structures comprising or related to abnormal objects, such as micro-calcification clusters, round-or-lobulated masses, spiculated masses, architectural distortions, etc.; as well as benign tissue structures comprising or related to normal breast tissues, such as linear tissues, cysts, lymph nodes, blood vessels, etc. Further, an object or region consisting of or containing a first type of tissue structure may be highlighted in a first manner in a displayed merged image, and an object or region consisting or containing a second type of tissue structure may be highlighted in a second manner different from the first manner in the displayed merged image. [00074] In various embodiments, the user may input a command through the user interface selecting or otherwise identifying a certain type of tissue structure, and, in response to the received command, the system performs one or both of (i) automatically highlighting in a displayed merged image objects comprising the selected type of tissue structure and/or regions containing one or more objects comprising the selected type of tissue structure, and (ii) automatically concurrently displaying the respective source slice (or otherwise the slice with best depiction of) a tissue structure of the selected type in the breast image data, e.g., a most prominent one of the selected tissue structure type based on a comparison, if more than one is detected in the source image stack. Thus, when the user "click" on (or very close to) a micro-calcification spot/cluster in a merged 2D image, and the system automatically concurrently displays the source (or otherwise best) tomosynthesis image slice including the corresponding micro-calcification in 3D. By way of another example, a user can select (through the user interface) a region in a merged 2D image that has the appearance with radiating line patterns (often an indication of spiculated masses), and the system will concurrently display the source (or otherwise best) 3D tomosynthesis slice, or perhaps to a series of consecutive tomosynthesis slices, for viewing the radiating line patterns. [00075] FIGS. 3 and 5-8 depict embodiments in which an image slab, which is synthesized from a subset of the plurality of tomosynthesis image slices, may be used to navigate that subset of tomosynthesis image slices. In a similar manner, an image slab synthesized from an entire stack of tomosynthesis image slices, can be used to navigate a set of image slabs, which are each generated from respective subsets of tomosynthesis image slices. In such a system, when a user reviewing the image slab generated from the entire stack of tomosynthesis image slices identifies an any object or region of interest that merit further review, the system provides immediate, automated navigation to a "best" corresponding image slab (or a subset of adjacent image slabs) to allow the user to conduct this further review to verify and evaluate the finding. [00076] In various embodiments, the user may input a command through the user interface, activating dynamic display functionality, wherein the system automatically highlights those objects and tissue structures that (dynamically) correspond to the location of a user movable input device in a displayed merged image (e.g., a hovering mouse pointer). In such embodiments, the system may further comprise automatically concurrently displaying a respective source image of a highlighted selected tissue structure that corresponds to a given location of a user movable input device in a displayed merged image, again, on a dynamic basis. [00077] In one embodiment, the system can be activated to provide a "shadow" cursor that is displayed on the right-hand-side monitor 126, in a location corresponding to the same (X, Y) location as the user's actual curser on the left-hand-side monitor 124, so that moving the curser around in the 2D image moves the shadow curser in the tomosynthesis image at same X, Y coordinates. The reverse can also be implemented, i.e., with the active user curser operable in the right-hand monitor 126, and the show curser in the left-hand monitor 124. In one implementation, this dynamic display feature allows the system to follow the user's point of interest, e.g. mouse cursor location in a 2D merged image, and dynamically display/highlight the most "meaningful" region(s) underneath in real time. For example, the user can move the mouse (without clicking any button) over a blood vessel, and the system will instantly highlight the vessel contour. [00078] According to yet another aspect of the disclosed inventions, post review storage of the breast image data is done at the slab level, rather than at the individual reconstructed Tr slice level, in order to reflect the same image data that was actually reviewed by the user, and also to greatly reduce the storage capacity needed for storing the breast image data. By way of example, in one embodiment, the system may display a user interface configured to receive input from a user, including a number of Tr slices 10 per slab 30, an amount of overlap between adjacent slabs 30, and a stack size. The system generates the plurality of slabs 30 based on the user input, and the user then views the displayed slabs (or a subset thereof) in order to study the breast image data. Once the user review of displayed slabs is complete, the image data is transmitted for storage (e.g., in the PACS system of a hospital) as a file containing just the generated slabs, and not the underlying full stack of Tr image slices. [00079] Having described exemplary embodiments, it can be appreciated that the examples described above and depicted in the accompanying figures are only illustrative, and that other embodiments and examples also are encompassed within the scope of the appended claims. For example, while the flow diagrams provided in the accompanying figures are illustrative of exemplary steps; the overall image merge process may be achieved in a variety of manners using other data merge methods known in the art.

It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made to the depicted and/or described embodiments (e.g., the dimensions of various parts), and that various embodiments according to the invention may combine elements or components of those disclosed embodiments even if not expressly exemplified herein in such combination.
