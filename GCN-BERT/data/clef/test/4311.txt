(E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(2-(cyclopropylamino)-2-oxoethoxy)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpr opyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoqumolm-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(2-(cyclopropylamino)-2-oxoethoxy)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl )-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 3c (173 mg, 0.4 mmol) and 2-bromo-N-cyclopropylacetamide 30a (107 mg, 0.6 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "Organic & Biomolecular Chemistry, 2014, 12(44), 8952-8965") were dissolved in 3 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide, then potassium carbonate (110 mg, 0.8 mmol) was added. The reaction was warmed up to 90Â°C and stirred for 12 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(2-(cyclopropylamino)-2-oxoethoxy)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl )-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 30b (12 mg, yield 5.6%) as a light yellow solid.
