2-(tert-butyl)-4-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5-methoxypyridine
To a 100 mL 2-neck round bottom flask was added nickel chloride dimethoxyethane adduct (0.044 g, 0.199 mmol) and 1,3-dicyclohexyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium tetrafluoroborate (0.064 g, 0.199 mmol), followed by a solution of 2-bromo-4-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5-methoxypyridine (0.660 g, 1.986 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (8 mL). The system was evacuated and back-filled with nitrogen seven times, and the reaction was cooled to −10° C. tert-Butylmagnesium chloride (1 M in tetrahydrofuran) (4 mL, 4 mmol) was added dropwise, and the reaction was stirred at −10° C. for 100 minutes. After this time, the reaction was quenched with chips of ice and was allowed to warm to room temperature. The mixture was poured into saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution and was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Silica gel chromatography, eluting with 5 to 50% ethyl acetate-heptane, afforded the title compound 2-(tert-butyl)-4-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-5-methoxypyridine (0.178 g, 29% yield).
