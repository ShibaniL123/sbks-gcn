2,5-Dichloro-N-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (C3)
To a solution of 2,5-dichloro-N-(2-(isopropylthio)phenyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (20.0 g, 63.7 mol) in ethyl acetate (180 g), peracetic acid (33.4 g of a solution in acetic acid; 5.7 mmol/g) was added while maintaining an internal temperature of 20-30° C. After a reaction time of 16 hours, ethyl acetate (90 g) was added, followed by aqueous sodium sulfite (112 g of a 11% w/w solution) and maintaining an internal temperature of below 45° C. The phases were separated and to the organic phase was added Water (63 g), followed by aqueous NaOH (25% w/w solution) to adjust the pH 7-8. The phases were separated, the organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuum. Ethanol (217 g) was added the mixture refluxed. After slow cooling to 0-5° C., the precipitate was filtrated and dried under vacuum to yield 2,5-dichloro-N-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (19.5 g, 88% yield) as a white powder.
