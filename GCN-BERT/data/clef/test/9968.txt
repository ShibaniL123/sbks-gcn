In one variation, the adhesive may be configured to adhere to the person's skin in moist, damp or water-logged conditions. The device may be configured with certain safety features. For example, the entire device may be waterproof. As another example, the battery and/or electrodes may be encased in an impermeable casing. An over the counter device may be configured to operate within certain ranges specified by government authorities. The device may comprise a contact probe. The contact probe may be configured to detect contact with a person's skin. In one embodiment, the device is configured to emit an electrical signal when the contact probe detects contact with a person's skin. In a variation, the device may emit an electrical signal after the contact probe detects continuous contact with a person's skin. For example, the device may emit an electrical signal after the contact probe detects continuous contact with a person's skin for two, three or more seconds. Such a delay may give a person time to effectively secure the device. The device may comprise a flexible, cloth-like material. such as found in a bandage or an adhesive bandage. As examples, the material may comprise a woven fabric, plastic, or latex rubber. In one embodiment, the device is configured to provide levels of stimulus below levels requiring a physician's prescription. Such embodiments may be made commercially available, or “over-the-counter” (OTC) without a physician's prescription. In one embodiment, an over-the-counter device may not output an electrical signal above 25 microcoulumbs. In another variation, the device may be configured to be operated by a professional. For example, a device configured to output an electrical signal above 25 microcoulumbs may be configured to be operated by a physician. An OTC device may have a fixed or finite operational time. In one embodiment, the device is configured to operate for up to eight hours. In one embodiment an OTC device may have no replaceable, rechargeable, or interchangeable parts. Additionally, the device's electrodes may be manufactured with a type of balm, such as menthol, or medication, such as ibuprofen gel, that is integrated into the electrode surfaces. This allows the device to also serve as a transdermal delivery system of either over the counter or prescribed medications.
