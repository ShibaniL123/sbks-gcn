SEPARATE DELIVERY OF ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN CONSUMABLE GASIFIED CRYSTALS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [001] This application ciaims priority pursuant to co-pending U.S. Provisiona! Patent Application Serial No. 61/979,331 filed April 14, 2014, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [002] The present invention relates to a method and a product for separate delivery of active ingredients contained in consumabie gasified crystals. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [003] Consumable gasified crystal products are known in the art. By way of example, U.S. Patent No. 3,985,909 discloses a method for incorporating a gas in a candy. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,985,910 and 4,001 ,457 disclose methods for making a gasified confection. U.S. Patent No. 4,289,794 describes a method for preparing gasified candy whereby a sugar melt is gasified at superatmospheric pressure and then cooled below its fusion temperature under superatmospheric pressure to form a gasified candy. As the gasified candy is wetted in the mouth the candy melts and the gas escapes producing an entertaining popping sensation. U.S. Patent No. 4,263,328 describes a method of preparation of a tabieted confection of gasified candy and mention that such candies may include a breath freshener. U.S. Patent No. 4,271 ,206 describes gasified confection prepared by molding to a predetermined shape. [004] Consumable carbonated products also have been formulated with nutritional and pharmaceutical ingredients. For example, U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/0241209 discioses a gasified candy that is formulated with vstamins and amino acids. U.S. Patent No. 7 887,832 discloses a pharmaceuticai composition comprising a pharmaceutical agent. The gasified compositions from these references are formulated by adding an active ingredient (i.e. vitamins, amino acids or a drug} to a hot melt of sugar and syrup which is then pressurized and coo!ed to produce crystais with a homogenous mixture of ingredients. In addition, U.S. Patent Application No. 2013/012599 discloses the combination of gasified consumable materials with active ingredients such as nutritionai supplements and pharmaceuticals. [005] The prior art does not disclose separate deiivery of active ingredients as disc!osed in this appiication. [006] As development of utilitarian, nutraceutical, and medicinal uses of crystals continues, a more precise production and deiivery of the active ingredients becomes important and necessary, a!ong with a means to retain functionality of heat sensitive and non-heat sensitive ingredients. Some active ingredients function best when delivered separately for release when crystals begin to melt in the mouth. Some ingredients also create a less than desirable mouth feel when not incorporated in a secondary step. [007] The benefit of a separate delivery of active ingredients in consumable gasified crystals is several. First, two or more of the active ingredients may offset, confiict, or adversely impact each other if combined in storage or the preparation process. For example, some vitamins, minerals, and other active ingredients such as caffeine adversely affect taste. Adding masking agents before and/or after the offending item can produce a much more pleasant user experience. Second, the various ingredients may function best when one is delivered before the other, or one is delivered more slowly than another. Third, a greater impact may occur by the layered or separate delivery. Fourth, some ingredients are best heated while others are adversely affected by heat. A separate or layered delivery method can accommodate both. SUMMARY OF INVENTION [008] The separate delivery of ingredients for consumable gasified crystals of the present invention is created by using a gasification step and at least one fol!ow-on step in the production of gasified crystals. During the gasification step, ingredients that are not susceptible to temperature degradation are mixed with distilled H20 and heated to a predetermined temperature to create suspension of the heated pre-blend. The heated pre-blend is then cooked at a predetermined temperature using a combination of atmospheric and vacuum cooking. C02, Nitrogen, or other consumable gaseous materia! is injected into the blended suspension, which is then cooled and broken to form gasified crystals. [009] In one or more follow-on steps, the gasified crystals from the gasification step are mixed with a consumable binding oi!, such as sunflower or coconut oil, to cover the surfaces of the gasified crystals. Then the desired additional blend of materials is s!ow!y mixed with the oiled gasified crystals to achieve maximum dispersion of the foliow-on blend of materials onto the surface of the gasified crystals. [010] The separate or layered delivery for gasified crystals of the present invention may be used to deliver active ingredients for a variety of purposes, including energy, oral care, or dietary supplements, among other things. The iayered or separate delivery of ingredients from the gasified crystals provides several benefits. Where a gasified crystal product has two or more of active ingredients that offset, conflict, or adversely impact each other if combined in storage or the preparation process, the method for creating separate or !ayered delivery of ingredients in gasified crystals of the present invention prevents the incompatible active ingredients from interacting. For example, some vitamins, minerals, and other active ingredients such as caffeine adversely affect taste. Adding masking agents before and/or after the offending item can produce a much more pleasant user experience. In addition, various ingredients may function best when one is delivered before the other, or one is delivered more slowly than another. Also, a greater impact may result from a layered or separate delivery of ingredients. Further, some ingredients are best heated while others are adversely affected by heat. A separate or layered delivery method can accommodate both. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS [011] The accompanying figures are incorporated herein and form a part of the specification for the present invention and further illustrate the present invention; FIG. 1 is an example of the present invention for use with delivering and energy boost. FIG. 2 is an example of the present invention for use with delivering oral care. FIG, 3 is an example of the present invention for use with delivering dietary supplements. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION [01 ] The method and products of the present invention relate to a separate or layered delivery of ingredients for consumable gasified crystals, which are made using a gasification step and one or more foi low-on steps to ailow for a layering of ingredients in and/or on the gasified crystals. [013] in a preferred embodiment, the gasification step of the present invention includes blending high-temperature amenable ingredients with distilled HaO to create a high-temperature pre-biend. Ingredients that may be used in the high-temperature pre- blend include isomalt sugar, sait, zinc gluconate, other similar materials, and various active ingredients. The high-temperature pre~blend is placed in a cooker that uses a combination of atmospheric and vacuum cooking. The high-temperature pre-blend is heated to a temperature of approximateiy 180°F to 200°F to achieve suspension. [014] The suspension of high-temperature pre-blend is then cooked to a temperature ranging between 285° F to 350°F. The vacuum on the cooker is then drawn to approximately 16-22 inches Mercury, which will cause the temperature to decrease. The vacuum draw should continue until the temperature returns to 285°F and 305°F. The vacuum is released and the high-temperature pre-blend is transferred to a pressure vessel where flavor, color and other ingredients may be added before the pressure vessel is sealed. After the pressure vessel is sealed, CO , Nitrogen, or other consumable gas is injected into the pressure vessel using a sparge tube with an aperture of approximately 1.6 mm. The consumable gas is injected into the pressure vessel until the pressure increases to approximately 550~60Gpsi. The high-temperature pre-blend is constantly agitated in the pressure vessel while the gas is being injected. After the gas is injected, the product is cooled rapidly to harden and capture the pressurized gas in the material to form a gasified materia!. The gasified material is then broken into the desired sizes of gasified crystals using methods known in the art. [016] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a follow-on step for processing the gasified crystals includes pre-biending additional materials in a blending device. The follow-on pre-b!end material may include active ingredients, sugar, flavor powders, flavor masks, among other ingredients. The follow-on step also includes placing the gasified crystals into blending device, such as a confectionary pan and adding consumable binding oil such as sunflower oil or coconut oil and then mixing the gasified crystals with the binding oil so that the oil covers the various surfaces of the gasified crystals. The follow-on pre-blend materia! is then added to the blending device so that the follow-on material attaches to the oiled surfaces of the gasified crystals using a continuous panning wave or other process known in the art to achieve maximum dispersion of the additional materials onto the oiled surfaces of the gasified crystals. The resulting material is then dried using sanitary air blow. [016] Additional and simi!ar follow-on steps may be utilized to !ayer additional ingredients onto the gasified crystals. [017] The present invention is best understood by reference to the detailed description and the three examples provided herein. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description and examples given herein are provided for explanatory purposes and that the invention extends beyond the limited embodiments described. For example, those skilled in the art will recognize a multiplicity of alternate and suitable approaches, depending upon the needs of the particular product or application. That is, numerous modifications and variations of the invention may exist that are too numerous to be fisted but that ali fit within the scope of the invention. [018] The present invention should not be lim ted to the particular methodology, compounds, materials, manufacturing techniques, uses, and applications, described herein, as these may vary. The terminology used herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include the plurai reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to "an ingredient1' is a reference to one or more ingredients and includes equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art. Similarly, for another example, a reference to "a step" or "a means" may be a reference to one or more steps or means and may include sub-steps and subservient means. Also, singular words should be read as plural and vice versa and masculine as feminine and vice versa, where appropriate, and alternative embodiments do not necessarily imply that the two are mutually exclusive. [019] All conjunctions used herein are to be understood in the most inclusive sense possible. Thus, a group of items linked with the conjunction "and" should not be read as requiring that each and every one of those items be present in the grouping, but rather should be read as "and/of unless expressly stated otherwise. Similarly, a group of items linked with the conjunction aor" should not be read as requiring mutual exclusivity among that group, but rather should be read as "and/or" unless expressly stated otherwise. Structures described herein are to be understood also to refer to functional equivalents of such structures. Language that may be construed to express approximation should be so understood unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. [020] Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) are to be given their ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are not to be limited to a special or customized meaning unless expressly so defined herein. [021] Terms and phrases used in this application, and variations thereof, especially in the appended claims, unless otherwise expressly stated, should be construed as open ended as opposed to limiting. As examples of the foregoing, the term "including" should be read to mean "including, without limitation,1' "including but not limited to,'' or the like: the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least"; the term "includes" should be interpreted as Includes but is not limited to"; the term "example" is used to provide exemplary instances of the item in discussion, not an exhaustive or limiting list thereof; and use of terms like "preferably," "preferred," "desired," "desirable/' or "exemplary" and words of similar meaning should not be understood as implying that certain features are critical essential, or even important to the structure or function of the invention, but instead as merely intended to highiight alternative or additional features that may or may not be utilized in a particular embodiment of the invention. [022] Those skilled in the art will also understand that, if a specific number for a claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation, no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and ' one or more" to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases shou!d not be construed to imply a claim recitation by the indefinite articles lla'! or "an" limits any particuiar ciaim containing such claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same ciaim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "ans {e.g., ea" and "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of claim recitations is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C" is used, in general, such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). [023] All numbers expressing dimensions, quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification are to be understood as being modified in ali instances by the term "about" or ''approximately" unless expressly stated otherwise. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth herein are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained. [024] Example No. 1 as set forth in FIG. 1 describes a preferred method of the present invention for making a consumable gasified crystai with a layered or separate delivery of a proprietary biend of active ingredients for energy boost, in the gasification step of Example No. 1 , the high-temperature pre-blend comprises: (a) isomalt in the range of 71 .6% to 75.3% by weight of the total final product weight; (b) a proprietary pre-blend of energy ingredients in the range of 4.78% to 5.04% by weight; (c) salt in the range of 0.31 % to ,33% by weight; and (d) distilled H20 in the range of 18.91 % to 19.89% by weight. The high-temperature pre-blend ingredients are mixed in a kettle and heated to 200°F. The high-temperature pre-blend is transferred to a vacuum cooker and heated to 312°F to achieve suspension. The vacuum on the vacuum cooker is drawn to 16 plus inches mercury and then continued until the temperature again reaches 305°F. The high-temperature pre-blend is transferred from the vacuum cooker to a pressurized reactor where additional pre-biended materials are added, namely: (a) raspberry flavor liquid in the range of 16.60% to 17.45% by weight; (b) natural peppermint flavor in the range of 25,07% to 26.37% by weight; and (c) naturai and artificial masking agents in the range of 55.32% to 58.17%.

The pre-blended additional ingredients are added to the mixing device and the mixed with the oiled gasification crystals until the surface of the crystals are coated with the pre-blend of additional ingredients. In this example, the percentage by weight of the pre-blended additional ingredients ranges between 80.99% and 85.17%, the binding oil ranges between 3.39% to 3.57%, and the pre-blend of additional ingredients ranges between 12.61 %» and 13.26% by weight [026] Example No. 2 as set forth in FIG. 2 describes a preferred method of the present invention for making a consumab!e gasified crystal with a layered or separate delivery of ingredients for breath treatment. In the gasification step of Example No. 2, the high-temperature pre-biend comprises: (a) isomalt in the range of 77.34% to 81 .30% by weight of the total final product weigh; and (b) distilled H^O in the range of 18.40% to 19,37% by weight. The high-temperature pre-blend ingredients are mixed in a kettle and heated to 200°F. The high-temperature pre-blend is transferred to a vacuum cooker and heated to 312°F to achieve suspension. The vacuum on the vacuum cooker is drawn to 16 plus inches mercury and then continued until the temperature again reaches 305° F. The high-temperature pre-blend is transferred from the vacuum cooker to a pressurized reactor where CO2 gas is injected into the pressurized reactor until the pressure reaches 550psi for at ieast 4 minutes. The gasified material is transferred from the pressurized reactor to a cooling device and is cooled rapidly until hardened. The hardened gasified material is then broken info desired sizes using methods known in the art. [027] In the follow-on step of Exam le No. 2, an oral care pre-blend of additional ingredients is created using the foilowing ingredients: (a) a xylitol in the range of 78.47% to 82.49% by weight; (b) peppermint flavor powder in the range of 11.38% to 11.96% by weight; (c) zinc gluconate in the range of 7.45% to 7.84% by weight; and (d) sucraiose in the range of 0.20% to 0.21 % by weight. The gasified crystals from the gasification step are placed into a mixing device. A binding or tacking oil, such as coconut oil, sunflower oil or other similar oil, is added to the mixing device and mixed with the gasification crystals until the oil covers the surfaces of the crystals. The oral-care pre- blend of additional ingredients is added to the mixing device and mixed with the oiled gasification crystals until the surface of the crystals are coated with the pre-blend of additional ingredients. In this example, the percentage by weight of the pre-blended additional ingredients ranges between 77.34% and 81.30%, the binding oil ranges between 0.78% to 0.82%, and the oral-care pre-blend of additional ingredients ranges between 19.08% and 20.06% by weight.

The high-temperature pre-blend ingredients are mixed in a kettle and heated to 200°F. The high-temperature pre-blend is transferred to a vacuum cooker and heated to 312°F to achieve suspension. The vacuum on the vacuum cooker is drawn to 16 plus inches mercury and then continued until the temperature again reaches 305°F, The high-temperature pre-blend is transferred from the vacuum cooker to a pressurized reactor where CO2 gas is injected into the pressurized reactor until the pressure reaches 550psi for at least 4 minutes. The gasified material is transferred from the pressurized reactor to a cooling device and is cooled rapidly until hardened. The hardened gasified material is then broken into desired sizes using methods known in the art. [029] In the follow-on step of Example No. 3, an dietary supplement pre-blend of additionai ingredients is created using the following ingredients: (a) a blend of a variety dietary supplements, including gingko, biloba, choline, Vitamin A, and Vitamin 03, among others, in the range of 44.70% to 46.99% by weight; (b) Omega 3 in the range of 35.07% to 35,81 % by weight; (c) fruit flavor powder in the range of 13.36% to 14.04% by weight; (d) citric acid In the range of 5.07% to 5.33%; and (e) sucralose in the range of 0.30% to 0.32% by weight. The gasified crystals from the gasification step are placed into a mixing device, A binding or tacking oil, such as coconut oil sunflower oil or other similar oil, is added to the mixing device and mixed with the gasification crystals until the oil covers the surfaces of the crystals. The oral-care pre-blend of additionai ingredients is added to the mixing device and mixed with the oiled gasification crystals until the surface of the crystals are coated with the pre-blend of additional ingredients. In this example, the percentage by weight of the pre-blended additional ingredients ranges between 70.10% and 73.70%, the binding oil ranges between 3.40% to 3.60%, and the dietary supplement pre-blend of additional ingredients ranges between 23,99% and 25.22% by weight. [030] The gasified crystals described in the Examples 1 , 2 and 3 provide a uniquely positive experience for a consumer, including the ability to avoid some of the unpleasant flavors associated with the active ingredients and the ability to enjoy a uniform dispersal of active ingredients, which aliow the gasified crystals to remain in the mouth ionger to improve absorption of the active ingredients. 1.
