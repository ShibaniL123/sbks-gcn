The invention concerns benzodioxane-piperidine-oxazolidinone and benzodioxane-piperidine-morpholinone derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their therapeutic applications, as partial agonists or antagonists of the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors and antagonists of α2C adrenergic receptors for the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. According to the invention, these disorders include, in a non-limiting manner, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism and cognitive problems associated with various neurological disorders. Schizophrenia is a term used to describe a group of pathologies of unclear origin that affect approximately 1% of the general population. This pathology is characterized by a variety of symptoms, which are classified as positive symptoms (hallucinations, delirium, disorganized thinking) and negative symptoms (social withdrawal and affective blunting), with an onset age in adolescence or early adulthood that can persist in the chronic form with episodes of exacerbation for many years. Cognitive deficits, such as problems with executive function, memory and verbal expression make up an integral part of the symptomotology throughout the course of this disorder. Patients with schizophrenia may be treated with drugs called neuroleptics, also known as antipsychotics. The therapeutic effect of antipsychotics is generally recognized as resulting from blockage of receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. There are five known subtypes of the dopamine receptor, called D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5 (Sokoloff, P. et al., Novel dopamine receptor subtypes as targets for antipsychotic drugs. Annals New-York Academy of Sciences, 1995, 757, 278-292) and conventional antipsychotics are antagonists (or partial agonists, for Example aripiprazole) of the D2 and D3 receptors. The importance of blocking the D3 subtype for treating schizophrenia and other conditions has been emphasized (Sokoloff P, Diaz J, Le Foil B, Guillin O, Leriche L, Bezard E, Gross C. The dopamine D3 receptor: a therapeutic target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. 2006, 5: 25-43). Antipsychotics based on the concomitant blockage of the D2 and D3 receptors are relatively active in improving the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In return, they are only slightly active or inactive against the negative symptoms and for improving cognitive deficits. There is therefore a need to find new ingredients for antipsychotics with improved efficacy. The literature also mentions that alpha2-adrenergic antagonist products potentiate the effect of antipsychotics (Litman R E, Hong W W, Weissman E M, Su T P, Potter W Z, Pickar D. Idazoxan, an alpha 2 antagonist, augments fluphenazine in schizophrenic patients: a pilot study. J Clin Psychopharmacol. 1993, 13:264-267) and act favorably on cognitive deficits (Marien M R, Colpaert F C, Rosenquist A C. Noradrenergic mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases: a theory Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 2004; 45:38-78; Svensson T H. Alpha-adrenoceptor modulation hypothesis of antipsychotic atypicality. Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 2003 October; 27 (7):1145-58). Alpha2-adrenergic receptors play a critical role in regulating neuronal activity and neurotransmitter release. Alpha2-adrenergic receptors are made up of three genetically and functionally distinct subtypes: alpha2A, alpha2B and alpha2C. Comparative studies with transgenic mice have shown that the alpha2A subtype is the primary mediator of certain effects induced by alpha2-adrenergic agonists not selective for subtype, such as sedation, analgesia, hypothermia, sympathetic inhibition and reduction of blood pressure. Likewise, neuropsychopharmacological tests on KO (“knock-out”) mice that do not express the receptor or OE (over-expressing) mice that over-express the receptor show that the alpha2C-adrenergic subtype has a distinct inhibitor role in the development of sensory information, and in the control of cognitive, motor and emotional activities and those related to central nervous system stress (Scheinin M, Sallinen J, Haapalinna A (2001) Evaluation of the alpha2C-adrenoceptor as a neuropsychiatric drug target; studies in transgenic mouse models. Life Sci. 68: 2277-2285). It has therefore been proposed that compounds selective for alpha2C receptors may be therapeutically useful in various disorders or conditions of the central nervous system, for example, to improve the cognitive symptoms associated with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder or neurodegenerative diseases and their progression. These diseases include, as non-exhaustive examples, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive supranuclear palsy, Down syndrome, corticobasal degeneration, pugilistic dementia, multiple system atrophy, Lewy body disease, Pick's disease), or age-related disorders or mood, depression, anxiety disorders and mental diseases propagated by stress. Ischemic and post-ischemic brain disorders, strokes and their consequences and narcolepsy are also concerned (MacDonald E, Kobilka B K, Scheinin M. Gene targeting: homing in on alpha 2-adrenoceptor-subtype function. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1997, 18: 211-219; Arnsten A F. Adrenergic targets for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Psychopharmacology (Berl) 2004, 174:25-31). Disorders and diseases in which patients are generally or occasionally treated by antipsychotics, such as bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders or major depression are also concerned by the therapeutic use of D2 and D3 receptor antagonists or partial agonists and alpha2C receptor antagonists, the subject of the present invention. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder, historically known as manic-depression, where patients live alternatingly in a state where excitation is abnormally elevated (manic or hypomanic state), and, in many cases, in an unusually depressed state. This disorder takes many forms. Bipolar disorder may appear as unipolar depression: a cyclic depressive state without the presence of mania (or hypomania). Bipolar disorder starts in childhood or adulthood for the majority of patients; most often the first episodes are depression. Estimates of the lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder vary, with studies generally giving values of around 1%. The DSM-IV-TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, American Psychiatric Association, 2004) lists three specific subtypes and one unspecified one: Bipolar disorder I: one or more manic episodes.Bipolar disorder II: no manic episodes, but one or more hypomanic episodes and one or more episodes of major depression.Cyclothymia: history of hypomanic episodes with periods of depression that do not meet the criteria for major depressive episodes. Antipsychotics are generally used to treat the manic or hypomanic phase. Some, like quetiapine, are also used to treat the depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. Some antipsychotics are also used to treat autism, which consists of learning and socialization problems, as well as stress-related disorders in children and adolescents, whether they are associated with specified or unspecified pervasive developmental disorders, childhood and adolescent disintegrative disorder, early deficit psychoses, developmental disharmony of psychotic type, autisms or atypical form mood disorders, according to the ICD-10 classifications (10th edition of “International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems”, ICD-10, Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders: diagnostic criteria for research, World Health Organization, 1993 revised 1997), in the DSM-IV-TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, American Psychiatric Association, 2004) and the CFTMEA-R Classification Française des Troubles Mentaux de l'Enfant and de l'Adolescent [French Classification of Mental Disorders in Children and Adolescents](Mises, Quemada, CFTMEA R 2000. CTNERHI, Paris 2002; C. Bursztejn, P. Jeammet. Autism and psychoses in children in the CFTMEA R-2000, Annales medico-psychologiques, 160; 216-219, 2002). Finally, antipsychotics are used in severe forms of major depression, in patients with very high anxiety with delusions. Cardiovascular tolerance is a key factor in selecting a candidate alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist for clinical development. Therefore, understanding the respective role of alpha2-adrenergic receptors and other adrenergic receptors in regulating cardiovascular function is fundamentally important. Some clarifications on this subject were provided by a KO mice study (MacDonald et al., 1997, already cited) showing that activation of alpha2B adrenergic receptors counteracts the hypotensive effects of alpha2 agonists, involving the alpha2A subtype. These studies also indicate that alpha2C adrenergic receptors, despite their distribution in strategic positions in the central and peripheral nervous system, which could theoretically change cardiovascular homeostasis, do not seem to have significant functional impact, at least not in transgenic animal models. Thus, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor that was selective for subtype C could have reduced cardiovascular impact or better tolerance compared to an alpha2 antagonist not selective for subtype. The prior art mentions, for benzodioxane-piperidine derivatives bearing an amide, a urea or an imidazolidinone, as non-selective alpha2-antagonists (WO 97/28157, WO 98/02435); some of these products also have a weak affinity for the D2 dopaminergic receptor (T. Imbert, J. Med. Chem, 2000, 43: 3653-3664). During the development of the present invention, the inventors showed that these products already described act as effective or very effective agonists (full agonists) for D2 and D3 dopamine receptors. Activity as a D2 and D3 receptor agonist was determined according to the described methods (Bruins Slot L A, De Vries L, Newman-Tancredi A, Cussac D. Differential profile of antipsychotics at serotonin 5-HT1A and dopamine D2S receptors coupled to extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Eur J Pharmacol, 2006, 534; 63-70; Bruins Slot L A, Palmier C, Tardif S, Cussac D. Action of novel antipsychotics at human dopamine D3 receptors coupled to G protein and ERK1/2 activation. Neuropharmacology, 2007, 53: 232-241) for the following compounds, such as described in WO 97/28157 and WO 98/02435; 1-benzyl-3-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)imidazolidin-2-one1-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-3-methylimidazolidin-2-one1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-3-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)imidazolidin-2-one1-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-3-(pyridin-4-yl)imidazolidin-2-one3-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-1-phenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione(S)—N-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide(S)—N-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-4-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)benzamide(S)—N-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-4-(pyridin-4-yl)benzamide(S)—N-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-4-(pyridin-3-yl)benzamide(S)—N-(2-(1-((2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)-9-oxo-9H-fluorene-1-carboxamide. For these compounds, the intrinsic activity (in percentage of that for dopamine) varied from 20 to 88% for receptor D2 and from 85 to 102% for receptor D3. The power of the products (concentration producing half the maximum response) varied from 1.9 to 320 nanomoles/liter at receptor D2 and from 3.3 to 43 nanomoles/liter at receptor D3. These products therefore behave as effective to very effective agonists on receptors D2 and D3, which is not desirable to produce antipsychotics. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the introduction of substituents on the benzodioxane part and/or replacement of the amide parts, urea or imidazolidinone by a oxazolidinone or morpholinone heterocycle have a major and multiple pharmacological impact that renders these products much more interesting for producing new antipsychotics. Indeed, these chemical modulations: increase affinity with dopamine receptor D2give these new products a higher affinity for receptor D3reduce their agonist power on receptors D2 and D3render these products more powerful alpha2 antagonists on subtype alpha2C than on subtypes alpha2A and alpha2B. The compounds of the invention can therefore be used for preparing pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments for the treatment of neurological or psychiatric diseases, conditions or disorders, such as described above, for which products are sought that are both D2 and D3 antagonists, with a preferential affinity for receptor D3, and alpha2C antagonists. As used here, the term “salts” designates acid and base inorganic addition salts of the compounds of the present invention. Preferably, the salts are pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e., they are nontoxic for the patient to whom they are administered. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce any adverse, allergic or other undesirable reaction when they are administered to an animal or human. When used here, the term “pharmaceutically-acceptable excipient” includes any diluent, adjuvant or excipient, such as preservatives, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, dispersants, antibacterial or antifungal agents or agents that would delay absorption and intestinal and digestive absorption. The use of these media or vectors is well known in the art. Unless the agent is chemically incompatible with a chromone derivative, its use in pharmaceutical compositions with the compounds according to the invention is considered. In the context of the invention, the term “treatment” as used here means preventing or inhibiting the onset or progression of the disorder to which the term applies, or even to one or more symptoms of this disorder. “Therapeutically-active quantity” means a quantity of benzodioxane derivative effective for obtaining the desired therapeutic effect according to the invention. According to the invention, the term “patient” refers to a human or non-human mammal affected or even potentially affected by a disease. Preferentially the patient is a human.

The invention also concerns stereoisomer forms, including enantiomers of the compounds of general formula 1, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, and pharmaceutically-acceptable compositions containing them, and their use as a medicament intended to treat central nervous system disorders. Compounds of general formula 1 are prepared: according to diagram 1. Compounds of general formula 1 are obtained by nucleophilic substitution or coupling between type 3 piperidine derivatives and type 2 benzodioxane derivatives where X is a halogen, mesylate, tosylate or brosylate leaving group. Type 2 derivatives are prepared from corresponding hydroxyl compounds 4 according to diagram 2. Hydroxyl compounds 4 are prepared by the method described in J. Med. Chem, 1997, 40, 4235-4256, or according to the process described in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2001, 123, 12202-12206. Compounds of type 3 are prepared: by coupling of the corresponding type 5 oxazolidinone or morpholinone with a protected piperidine alkyl derivative—where P is a protecting group and X a leaving group as defined previously—followed by deprotection according to diagram 3. or for m=0 by construction of the oxazolidinone ring, according to diagram 4, from piperidine amino alcohol derivatives 6 by reaction with phosgene or a chemical analogue such as carbonyl diimidazole, followed by deprotection of the amine function of the piperidine moiety. or for m=1 by construction of the morpholinone ring, according to diagram 4, from piperidine amino alcohol derivatives 6 by reaction with chloroacetyl chloride, and then deprotection of the amine function of the piperidine moiety. The preceding compounds of type 6 are obtained: When R2 is borne by the carbon atom in a of the nitrogen atom of oxazolidinone or morpholinone, from a piperidine alcohol product after oxidation into aldehyde and reductive amination with amino alcohol derivatives 10 according to diagram 5 or when R2 is borne by the carbon atom in a of the oxygen atom of oxazolidinone or morpholinone, by opening of epoxides 11 by piperidine alkylamine itself prepared from piperidine alkyl alcohol according to diagram 6 For compounds of type 3 where R2 is an ester located at a of the nitrogen of oxazolidinone or morpholinone, it is subjected to chemical transformations such as reduction into alcohol and transformation into alkoxy 7, or such as reduction into aldehyde. The initial aldehyde or ester subjected to the action of nucleophiles respectively give the hydroxylated mono-addition compound 8 and di-addition compound 9 where R3 is an alkyl or phenyl or benzyl group, then the amine function of compounds 7, 8 and 9 is deprotected to give compounds 3 as described in diagram 7 The preceding compounds of type 5 are prepared for m=0, when they are not commercial: either when R2 is a single substituent borne by the carbon at a of the oxazolidinone nitrogen for phenyl substituted R2, from the corresponding aldehyde, which leads by Strecker reaction to type 12 aminobenzyl cyanides which are transformed to the corresponding type 13 amino alcohol by transformation of the nitrile function to amide and then to acid, which is then reduced to alcohol and the amine function is released by debenzylation, the amino alcohol 10 thus obtained is transformed into oxazolidinone 5 by reaction with phosgene or a chemical analog such as carbonyl diimidazole according to diagram 8 or for benzyl substituted R2, from amino acid or corresponding ester 14, which is reduced to amino alcohol then transformed to the corresponding oxazolidinone by reaction with phosgene or a chemical analog such as carbonyl diimidazole according to diagram 9. or for R2 alkoxy, or alkoxybenzyl or alkoxyphenyl from serine ester which is cyclized into the corresponding oxazolidinone by the action of phosgene or a chemical analog such as diimidazole carbonyl, then the ester function is reduced to the corresponding alcohol, the hydroxy function is transformed to the leaving group which is then substituted by the action of an alkoxide to give compound 3 as described in diagram 10. either when R2 represents several identical or different substituents on the oxazolidinone rings each independently representing: a C1-4 alkyl groupa phenyl groupa benzyl groupa C1-4 hydroxyalkyl group from serine ester (S or R)—or the corresponding hydroxy amino acid for longer chains—the amine and alcohol functional groups are protected, the di-protected product thus obtained is treated with an organic anion—for Example an organomagnesium—to yield corresponding di-substituted compound 15 (R4=alkyl, phenyl or benzyl), or first reduced to an aldehyde and then also treated with an anion to give corresponding monosubstituted compound 16 (R4=alkyl, phenyl or benzyl). Compounds 15 and 16 then undergo the cyclization/deprotection of the amine steps or the reverse, which is cyclized by sodium hydride into oxazolidinone whose nitrogen atom is then deprotected to provide corresponding compounds 5 after deprotection of the alcohol function according to diagram 11.

By considering the selective modulation of dopamine and norepinephrine transmissions that D2, D3 and alpha2C receptors exert in the brain, the compounds of the invention are suited to various therapeutic applications. The compounds of the invention can therefore be used for the preparation of compositions and pharmaceutical medicaments for the treatment of neurological or psychiatric diseases, conditions or disorders involving the D2, D3, and alpha2C receptors, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, pervasive developmental disorders, depression and cognitive deficits associated with various neurological conditions. The invention also concerns a treatment method for neurological or psychiatric conditions, diseases or disorders that consists of administrating a compound of formula 1 in a therapeutically effective quantity to a patient who requires treatment. It also concerns compounds of formula 1 for their use as a medicament and the use of a compound of formula 1 for the production of a medicament for the treatment of a neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder, erectile dysfunction or dependence on drugs and addictive substances. The invention concerns compounds of general formula 1 for the production of a medicament for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, pervasive developmental disorders or autism, major depression and cognitive disorders related to age or associated with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Compounds of formula 1 according to the invention may be orally, systemically, parenterally, nasally or rectally. In particular the compound may be administered orally in an appropriate formulation. The dosages of compounds of formula 1 in compositions of the invention can be adjusted to obtain a quantity of active substance that is effective to obtain a desired therapeutic response for a composition particular to the method of administration. The dosage level selected therefore depends on the desired therapeutic effect, the administration route, the desired treatment duration and other factors. Compounds of formula 1 have been evaluated in vitro as ligands for dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors and modulators of the activity of these receptors according to the invention in recombinant human cells expressing the receptors. The inhibition constants (Ki) were measured for dopaminergic receptors D2 and D3, and for adrenergic receptors alpha2A, alpha2B and alpha2C, according to the described methods (Newman-Tancredi A, Assie M B, Martel J C, Cosi C, Slot L B, Palmier C, Rauly-Lestienne I, Colpaert F, Vacher B, Cussac D. F15063, a potential antipsychotic with D2/D3 antagonist, 5-HT 1A agonist and D4 partial agonist properties. I. In vitro receptor affinity and efficacy profile. Br J Pharmacol., 2007, 151:237-252). The intrinsic activity of the products for the D2 receptor was measured (Bruins Slot L A, De Vries L, Newman-Tancredi A, Cussac D. Differential profile of antipsychotics at serotonin 5-HT1A and dopamine D2S receptors coupled to extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Eur J Pharmacol, 2006, 534; 63-70. The results obtained for some of these compounds are presented in the following table. Compounds of formula 1 were evaluated in vitro by the MK-801-induced hyperactivity test in mice (Leriche L. et al., Neuropharmacology 2003, 45, 174).

Example 31 was evaluated in rats in a memory test, the passive avoidance test (Chopin P, Briley M. Effects of four non-cholinergic cognitive enhancers in comparison with tacrine and galanthamine on scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats, Psychopharmacology (Berl), 1992; 106:26-30). This test consists of teaching a rat not to enter a dark compartment (its naturally preferred place) where it had previously received an electric shock (0.8 mA). The animal's reticence (the time lapse or “latency” to enter the dark compartment) measured 48 h after its training is considered as an index of its explicit-declarative memory. Latency greatly increases when an amnesic product such as scopolamine is administered shortly after receiving the first shock. A product with promnesic properties opposes the effects of scopolamine. Example 31, administered at doses of 0.16, 0.63, 2.5 and 10 mg/kg, was opposed to the effect of scopolamine; latencies expressed in seconds were 24±12, 60±21 and 78±22, respectively, after treatment by the carrier and by Example 1 at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg (P<0.05 for both doses of Example 1 vs. carrier by Mann-Whitney test) The total daily dose of compounds used according to this invention administered in single or divided doses can be in quantities, for example, of around 0.001 to around 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The specific dose for any given patient will depend on a variety of factors including bodyweight, general health, sex, diet, period and route of administration, levels of intestinal absorption and excretion, combination with other medicaments and severity of the particular disorder being treated. 1.
