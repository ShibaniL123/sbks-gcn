Synthesis of 8-(3-aminophenyl)-2-((2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl)amino)-7(8H)pteridinone
tert-butyl (3-((2-((2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl)amino)-7-oxo-8(7H)-pteri dinyl)phenyl)carbamate (452 mg, 0.77 mmol) was weighed into a 25 mL round bottom flask. 7 mL of methylene chloride was added and 2 mL of trifluoroacetic acid was added in an ice-bath with stirring. The reaction system was stirred for another 1 hour in an ice bath and for 1 hour at room temperature. After the reaction was completed, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution was added to neutralize the solution to pH = 9. The filtrate was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was washed with deionized water and saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried, and the solvent was spin-dried. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane / methanol = 20: 1, v/v) to obtain 8-(3-aminophenyl)-2-((2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl)amino)-7(8H)pteridinone, orange-red solids 132 mg, yield 35%.
