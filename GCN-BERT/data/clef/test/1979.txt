CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. US 61/951,602, filed on Mar. 12, 2014. FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates generally to the field of exercise devices, and more specifically provides a height-adjustable push-up apparatus. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Exercising is a popular activity and performing push-ups, in particular, is a desirable and effective way to increase upper body and core strength. Traditionally, push-ups are performed on a stationary ground surface or other horizontal surface. Performing push-ups in the conventional manner can have disadvantages, including lack of variability in performing the exercise and causing stresses and strains to one's body. Some prior art devices have been developed to aid in particular aspects of the push-up exercise. However, many of these devices are limited in adjustability, do not allow for modifications, do not increase comfort, do not relieve stresses and strains, do not allow for ease of storage and transport, are unstable and/or are unable to be sufficiently secured following adjustment. The present disclosure is directed to addressing these limitations and others. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides a height-adjustable push-up apparatus. The apparatus includes a handle engageable with a stationary base structure at different pre-defined heights. The apparatus may optionally include a set of interchangeable handles in different shapes. In certain aspects, the base structure includes four legs with suction cups which can engage a support surface. Internal to the base structure is a mechanism to selectively lock the handle to the base structure at different selected handle heights. In one specific embodiment, the base structure includes a push button system designed to engage an internal ball bearing mechanism which locks the components together. Embodiments also include an adjustable locking device, including a stem slideably received in an inner tube, an outer tube, and a latch member extendable toward the stem to fix the position of the stem in the locked position. When in the open position, the inner tube and outer tube are aligned to permit retraction of the latch member and allow the stem to slide to different height positions as desired. A spring or other elastic member may bias the device into the locked position while a button can be provided to disengage the locking mechanism. Other objects and advantages will be appreciated by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the disclosure, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the disclosure is thereby intended, such alterations, modifications, and further applications of the principles of the disclosure being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the disclosure relates. Illustrated in the figures are various views of an adjustable push-up apparatus 100 (and specific example components thereof) according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. FIGS. 1 and 2 show apparatus 100 in the locked and usable position, and at the lowest height adjustment. FIG. 3 shows apparatus 100 in the locked and usable position, and at the highest height adjustment. FIGS. 4A-4F shows a set of interchangeable handles with stems which may optionally be engaged with the base structure of the apparatus 100. FIGS. 5-10 show the internal workings of apparatus 100 at various heights, and at locked and unlocked positions. Turning to FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown a handle 102 engaged with a base structure 101 at the lowest height adjustment position. The illustrated base structure 101 includes a central hub 120 covering the internal workings of the base structure and legs 122 to engage a support surface. Legs 122 may extend in lateral or horizontal directions outward from the central hub 120. Legs 122 may be in fixed positions relative to the base structure or optionally, may pivot to provide differing orientations relative to the base structure or relative to the ground or other support surface. The base structure 101 also includes a push button release 130 designed to engage an internal mechanism to lock and unlock the handle 102 with respect to the base structure 101 and allow for height adjustment. Optionally, the legs 122 may include surface-engaging elements, such as the illustrated suction cups 124. The suction cups 124 may optionally be pivotably engaged with the legs 122 via rivets 154 (as seen, for example, in FIG. 5). Additional options for surface-engaging elements include adhesives; pads which may include a gripping material; mechanical fasteners such as screws, nails, or other components that project into the supporting surface; or brackets or hooks designed to engage mounting equipment included in the supporting surface. It should be appreciated that the legs and any surface-engaging elements may number greater or fewer than four and may be symmetrically or asymmetrically arranged around the base structure, as would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. In certain optional embodiments, there may be additional handles which can be selectively engaged with the base structure 101. The illustrated handle 102 is a ball handle that is approximately spherical. As shown in FIGS. 4A-4F, other optional selectively-engageable handles include a rectangular or cylindrical hammer-shaped handle 108 (in FIGS. 4A-4C) and a larger circular flatter handle 110 approximating an oblate spheroid (FIGS. 4D-4F), each with its own stem portion. It is contemplated that other shaped handles may be used, with only certain example shapes being illustrated. Variations in size, shape, and surface features are contemplated. For example, a handle shape may optionally include surface depressions or grooves to correspond with and guide individual fingers of a user when gripping the handle. The handles with stems may be interchanged as desired to provide for variability in performing push-up exercises using apparatus 100. The use of different interchangeable handles assists in activating different muscle groups in the user's body, including different muscles in the hands, arms, upper body and core. For example, each different interchangeable handle may activate different muscles groups while performing the push-up exercise. Optionally, interchangeable handles may have different length stems that provide even greater ranges of height adjustment. In yet other optional embodiments, the handles may be configured to rotate with respect to the base portion 101. For example, the stems may rotate or spin 360 degrees within the base portion 101 to provide additional variation in performing the push-up exercise. According to other embodiments, the stems may rotate less than 360 degrees, such as 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, or other ranges included therein. In preferred embodiments, the apparatus 100 provides for height adjustability to allow for variations in performing the push-up exercise. As illustrated in FIG. 3 for example, handle 102 includes a cylindrical stem 112 which is configured to be slideably positioned within base structure 101 and locked in position at selected heights. As shown, handle stem 112 includes a series of notches 114 along the height of the stem 112 to allow for selective positioning of the handle 102 at various heights with respect to the base structure 101 which remains stationary. Notches 114 may be depressions, grooves, channels, dimples, or other indentations into the cross-section of the stem. Notches may be limited to particular locations around the stem or may extend around part or all of the circumference or perimeter of the stem. Notches may be aligned or in offset positions relative to each other in particular embodiments. In the particular illustrated embodiment shown in FIGS. 5-6, the push button release 130 operates in conjunction with a set of internal ball bearings 131 designed to allow for the selective engagement and height positioning of the handle 102 with respect to the base portion 101 (see FIG. 6). However, it should be appreciated that other appropriate selective engagement and height-adjustment mechanisms may be used as would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the apparatus 100 may be adjusted to different heights within appropriate ranges. Referring to FIG. 6, the particular illustrated embodiment of the base structure 101 of apparatus 100 includes a spring 132, an inner tube 134 and an outer tube 136. The inner tube and outer tube may be coaxial and aligned in a vertical direction. The inner tube 134 has cut-away sections 135 and the outer tube 136 has recessed sections 137. The inner tube 134 defines a center hole 140 into which stem 112 is slideably received. As best illustrated in FIG. 7, at the locked position the ball bearings 131 reside in cut-away sections 135 and protrude at least partially into the set of aligned notches 114 to engage the handle 102 in a locking fashion. The spring 132 exerts an upward force on the outer tube 136, such that the recessed sections 137 are not aligned with the cut-away sections 135 and the outer tube 136 urges the ball bearings into the notches 114, thereby locking the handle 102 into position. When the device is in the open and unlocked position, the ball bearings 131 retract at least partially into the recessed sections 137 defined in outer tube 136, thereby allowing for sliding of the handle stem 112 within the center hole 140 as desired. To adjust the height of the device 100, a user may depress button 130 to unlock the device 100 and enable movement of the handle 102 with respect to the body structure 101. The button 130 may be pushed downward by a user, thereby causing the outer tube 136 to move downward against the biasing force of the spring 132. By pushing the button 130, the outer tube 136 is caused to move downward to a position where recessed areas 137 are aligned with cut-away sections 135. Upon such alignment, the ball bearings 131 will move outward or retract at least partially into the recessed sections 137 and out of the notches 114 in handle stem 112, as best illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9. In this way, the handle 102 may be freely adjusted within hole 140 to allow for height-adjustment of the device. Although the illustrated locking and unlocking mechanism is an example using a push button mechanism, it should be appreciated that other appropriate mechanisms may be used. When the handle 102 is adjusted to the desired height with respect to the base structure 101, the button 130 may be released, allowing the components to return to the locked position. Releasing the button 130 results in the spring 132 causing the outer tube 136 to move upward to a position where ball bearings 131 are urged into notches 114 and thus into locking engagement with the handle 102. Device 100 can be manufactured and assembled from standard materials, such as plastic or metal based materials as examples. Additionally, some or all of the components forming the exterior of device 100 may include coatings, covers or skins made of suitable materials. Additionally, the handles may optionally include texturing, be manufactured from a gripping material, or include an outer covering designed to assist with gripping of the apparatus 100 by a user during performance of a push-up exercise. Additionally, as mentioned above the figures provide non-limiting examples for the device 100. However, it should be appreciated that the device and its various components may be sized and configured differently as would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the Figures illustrate round or cylindrical base members, stems, and tubes, yet other shapes such as square, rectangular, elliptical, parabolic, polygonal, or irregular cross-sections may be provided to various components without departing from the disclosure. Further, it is contemplated that the device may include fewer than all of the example illustrated components shown in the accompanying figures, and/or may include additional suitable and/or necessary components not presently illustrated as would occur to one of ordinary skill in the art. While the disclosure has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiment has been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the disclosure are desired to be protected. 1.
