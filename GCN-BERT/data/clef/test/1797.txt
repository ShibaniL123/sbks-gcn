2-((S)-2-((S)-1-((S)-2-Ammonio-4-methylpentanoyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxamido)-2-phenylethyl)pyridinium dichloride
tert-Butyl (S)-4-methyl-1-oxo-1-((S)-2-((S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylcarbamoyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentan-2-ylcarbamate (200 mg, 0.39 mmol) was dissolved in a 1 M HCl solution in Et2O (15.7 mL, 15.7 mmol). The reaction was stirred at rt for 18 h. The product was triturated in Et2O. The solid was recovered by filtration on a BÃ¼chner funnel, washed with Et2O and dried under vacuum. The solid was dissolved in water and freeze dried to afford 130 mg (69%) of the title compound
