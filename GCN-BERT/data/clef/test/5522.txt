FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to expression profiles of HIV-specific T-cells and their methods of use. The invention also relates to agents for treatment of HIV. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Functional impairment of antigen-specific T cells is a defining characteristic of chronic infections in humans but the molecular mechanisms underlying this T-cell dysfunction are not well understood1. In contrast to the T cell response in acute infections, CD8+ T cells in chronic infection develop a range of functional defects that include the loss of IL2 secretion and proliferative potential2,3. Because cytokine secretion and proliferation are essential for effective control of viral replication, these defects—collectively referred to as T cell exhaustion—play a central role in the immunological failure to clear chronic viral pathogens such as HIV, HCV and HBV1. HIV infection provides a paradigm of T cell dysfunction in humans. The majority of individuals infected with HIV show elevation of viral load in the absence of anti-viral therapy (hereafter, “chronic progressors”) associated with defects in HIV-specific T cell cytokine secretion, proliferation and survival12,13. In contrast, spontaneous control of viral replication has been documented for a small minority of individuals (‘controllers’)11. BATF is a highly conserved member of the AP-1/ATF family, a group of transcription factors that regulate many aspects of cellular function in the immune system, including cytokine secretion and proliferation30. BATF antagonizes AP-1 function by dimerizing to Jun, disrupting the active Jun:Fos complex of AP-1, and reducing expression of AP-1 target genes20,24,31. Consistent with this, enforced expression of BATF in T cells inhibited the secretion of IL2, an AP-1 dependent gene, but not IFNγ which is not primarily regulated by AP-1. Schraml et al. have found BATF to be required for Th17 differentiation in CD4+ T cells33.

The present invention is also directed to agents useful for treatment of HIV. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the meaning commonly understood by a person skilled in the art to which this invention belongs. The following references provide one of skill with a general definition of many of the terms used in this invention: Singleton et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology (2nd ed. 1994); The Cambridge Dictionary of Science and Technology (Walker ed., 1988); The Glossary of Genetics, 5th Ed., R. Rieger et al. (eds.), Springer Verlag (1991); and Hale & Marham, The Harper Collins Dictionary of Biology (1991). As used herein, the following terms have the meanings ascribed to them below, unless specified otherwise. I. Definitions As used herein, “classifying an immune response”, for example in an individual infected with HIV, means determining if the individual is a chronic progressor or a controller, as defined herein. “Classifying” or “characterizing” means obtaining T-cells from the HIV infected individual and determining if the T-cells are those of a chronic progressor or a controller. Classifying or characterizing an immune response from an HIV infected subject comprises determining an expression profile, as defined hereinbelow, of an individual infected with HIV, by methods defined hereinbelow, and comparing the expression profile to 1) the expression profile of HIV-specific T-cells that are controllers and 2) the expression profile of HIV specific T-cells that are chronic progressors. An expression profile of an individual infected with HIV that is substantially similar, as defined herein, to the expression profile of HIV-specific T-cells that are controllers, classifies or characterizes the immune response of the individual infected with HIV as that of a controller. An expression profile of an individual infected with HIV that is substantially similar, as defined herein, to the expression profile of HIV-specific T-cells that are chronic progressors classifies or characterizes the immune response of the individual infected with HIV as that of a chronic progressor. As used herein, “expression profile” or “marker profile” is meant a characterization of the expression or expression level of two or more polypeptides or polynucleotides. As used herein, “expression profile” refers to the level or amount of gene expression of particular genes as assessed by methods described herein. The gene expression profile can comprise data for one or more genes and can be measured at a single time point or over a period of time. The expression profile of an HIV-infected T-cell of a chronic progressor is presented in FIG. 1b. The expression profile of an HIV-infected T-cell of a controller is presented in FIG. 1b. “Determining an expression profile” means performing a phenotype classification (e.g., chronic progressor or controller) by comparing the gene expression profile of the test sample with respect to one or more informative genes with one or more gene expression profiles (e.g., in a database). Informative genes include, but are not limited to, those shown in FIG. 11. Using the methods described herein, expression of numerous genes can be measured simultaneously. The assessment of numerous genes provides for a more accurate evaluation of the sample because there are more genes that can assist in classifying the sample. The “test sample” or “test cell” from which a gene expression profile is determined is an HIV specific T-cell from an HIV-infected individual that contains a gene expression product. A “reference sample” or “reference cell” or “control sample” or “control cell” can be any one of a T-cell from an HIV-infected subject that is a chronic progressor, a T-cell from an HIV-infected subject that is a controller, a T-cell from a subject that is not HIV-infected or a cell that is not a T-cell from an HIV-infected or non-HIV-infected subject. As used herein, expression refers to a protein or the RNA/transcript derived from the gene of interest of the expression profile. In such instances the expression of a gene of interest can be determined by measuring the amount of transcript directly or by measuring the amount of the protein product of the RNA of interest. Protein can be measured in protein assays such as by staining or immunoblotting or, if the protein catalyzes a reaction that can be measured, by measuring reaction rates. All such methods are known in the art and can be used. Any art-recognized methods for detecting RNA levels can be used (e.g., RT-PCR, Northern Blotting, etc.). As used herein, “chronic progressor, refers to an individual that is infected with HIV and that exhibits and increase in viral load over time, following the initial infection. A chronic progressor refers to an individual that has an expression profile that is substantially similar to that presented in FIG. 1b. As used herein a “controller” refers to a subject infected with HIV that exhibits a decrease in HIV viral load after the individual is infected with HIV and maintains the decreased HIV viral load over time. A “controller” also refers to an HIV-infected subject who remains asymptomatic with normal CD4 positive T-cell counts and low or undetectable plasma viral loads despite having never been treated with antiretroviral medications. A controller refers to an individual that has an expression profile that is substantially similar to that presented in FIG. 1b. As used herein, “increased” as it refers to the viral load of a subject means at least about 1-fold greater (for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 1000, 10,000-fold or more) than the viral load of a control subject. “Increased” as it refers to the viral load of a subject also means at least about 5% greater (for example 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 99 or 100%) than the viral load of a control subject.

As used herein, the phrase “substantially similar” refers to a similarity of at least 1 gene with respect to the genes of the expression profile. As used herein, “substantially similar” as it refers to an expression profile, means an expression profile wherein at least one of the genes of an expression profile of a test subject is expressed in the expression profile of a controller or a chronic progressor.

The information provided by the present invention alone or in conjunction with other test results, aids in sample classification (U.S.S.N. 2002/0155480, incorporated by reference in its entirety). As used herein, “immune response” refers to a response made by the immune system of an organism to a substance, which includes but is not limited to foreign or self proteins. Particularly, “immune response” refers to a CD8-positive T-cell mediated immune response to HIV infection. There are three general types of “immune response” including, but not limited to mucosal, humoral, and cellular “immune responses.” An “immune response” may be measured using a technique known to those of skill in the art. For example, enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assay (ELISA; U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,988; Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1995). According to the present invention, an antigen can be said to stimulate an “immune response” if the quantitative measure of immunoglobulins in an animal treated with an antigen detected by ELISA is statistically different from the measure of immunoglobulins detected in an animal not treated with the antigen, wherein the immunoglobulins are specific for the antigen. A statistical test known in the art may be used to determine the difference in measured immunoglobulin levels including, but not limited to ANOVA, Student's T-test, and the like, wherein the P value is at least <0.1, <0.05, <0.01, <0.005, <0.001, and even <0.0001. An immune response to HIV may be measured by measuring anyone of viral load, T-cell proliferation, T-cell survival and cytokine secretion by T-cells.

As used herein, “seronegative” refers to an individual with no detectable antibodies to a virus (e.g., HIV) in the blood. II. HIV Disease HIV disease, as used herein, refers to the continuum from an initial HIV infection to AIDS. Since HIV may begin causing subtle changes in the immune system long before an infected subject feels sick, the term “HIV disease” is commonly used to encompass the entire HIV spectrum, from initial infection to full-blown AIDS (which is also called “advanced HIV disease”). The HIV continuum described herein is representative of the experience of many subjects infected with HIV. The time that it takes for each individual to go through these stages varies. For most individuals, however, the progression of HIV disease is fairly slow, taking several years from infection to the development of severe immune suppression. Infection Following exposure to the virus, HIV enters the bloodstream and begins to take up residence in the cells; this is when HIV infection occurs. Individuals with HIV are considered to be infectious (able to transmit HIV to others) immediately after infection with the virus. An individual with HIV is infectious at all times. Also, an individual does not need to have symptoms or look sick to have HIV. In fact, individuals may look perfectly healthy for many years despite the fact that they have HIV in their bodies. The only way to confirm HIV infection is by taking an HIV test (that is detecting the presence of HIV antibodies in the bloodstream). Primary Infection (or Acute Infection) Primary HIV infection is the first stage of HIV disease, typically lasting only a week or two, when the virus first establishes itself in the body. Acute HIV infection describes the period of time between when an individual is first infected with HIV and when antibodies against the virus are produced by the body (usually 6 to 12 weeks) and can be detected by an HIV test. Up to approximately 70% of individuals newly infected with HIV will experience some “flu-like” symptoms during this stage. These symptoms, which usually last no more than several days, might include fevers, chills, night sweats, and rashes. Afterward, the infected individual returns to feeling and looking completely well. The remaining percentage of individuals either do not experience symptoms of acute infection or have symptoms so mild that they may not notice them. During acute HIV infection, the virus makes its way to the lymph nodes, a process which is believed to take three to five days. Then HIV actively replicates (makes copies of itself) and releases new viral particles into the bloodstream. This burst of rapid HIV replication usually lasts about two months. Individuals at this stage often have a very high HIV “viral load”. However, people with acute HIV infection usually will not test positive for HIV antibodies, since it takes the body approximately one to three months to produce antibodies against HIV. Seroconversion “Seroconversion” refers to production of antibodies to the virus by an HIV positive individual's immune system, in response to the infection. Most infected individuals develop antibodies within three months after infection, and some can take up to six months. The Asymptomatic Stage After the acute stage of HIV infection, individuals infected with HIV continue to look and feel completely well for long periods, usually for many years. During this time, the only indication that an individual is infected with HIV is a positive HIV antibody test. Early- and Medium-Stage HIV Symptomatic Disease When the immune system is compromised by HIV infection, many individuals begin to experience some mild HIV disease symptoms, such as skin rashes, fatigue, night sweats, slight weight loss, mouth ulcers, and fungal skin and nail infections. Most, though not all, will experience mild symptoms such as these before developing more serious illnesses. Although prognosis varies greatly depending on a number of factors, it is generally believed that it takes five to seven years for the first mild symptoms to appear. These symptoms mark the early and medium stages of HIV symptomatic disease. As the disease progresses, some individuals may become quite ill even if they have not yet been diagnosed with AIDS, the late stage of HIV disease. Typical problems include chronic oral or vaginal thrush (a fungal rash or spots), recurrent herpes blisters on the mouth (cold sores) or genitals, ongoing fevers, persistent diarrhea, and significant weight loss. These symptoms are not necessarily specific to HIV or the development of AIDS. However, they should be of concern to those who have tested positive for HIV. Usually, symptoms occur when the virus has already caused considerable damage to the immune system. Late-Stage HIV Disease (AIDS) When immune system damage is more severe, HIV positive individuals may experience opportunistic infections (called “opportunistic” because they are caused by organisms which do not ordinarily induce illness in people with normal immune systems, but take the opportunity to flourish in people with compromised immune systems). Some of the most common opportunistic infections include Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and candidiasis. III. Chronic Progressors or Controllers Chronic progressors or controllers can be identified within the first few months following HIV infection. HIV infected subjects can be classified as chronic progressors or controllers. Chronic Progressor Chronic progressor HIV infected individuals exhibit a high viral load, for example plasma HIV RNA levels >10,000 copies/mL, as compared to an individual that is not infected with HIV. The viral load of a chronic progressor increases over time, for example months (for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 months) or years (for example 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years. An HIV-specific T-cell isolated from a chronic progressor has an expression profile as presented in FIG. 1b. Controllers HIV infected individuals that are controllers are capable of maintaining their viral load at a very low levels, for example plasma HIV RNA levels <2000 copies/mL in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, measured three times over a period spanning at least 12 months. An HIV-specific T-cell isolated from a chronic progressor has an expression profile as presented in FIG. 1b. IV. Expression Profile The present invention relates to methods for classifying a sample according to the gene expression profile of the sample. In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to classifying a biological sample with respect to a phenotypic effect, e.g., viral load of an HIV-infected subject or predicted treatment outcome, comprising the steps of isolating a gene expression product from a sample, for example from a (one or more) cell in the sample, and determining a gene expression profile of at least one informative gene, wherein the gene expression profile is correlated with a phenotypic effect, thereby classifying the sample with respect to phenotypic effect. According to the methods of the invention, samples can be classified as belonging to (i.e., derived from) an individual who is not infected with HIV, an individual that is infected with HIV and is a controller or an individual who is infected with HIV and is a chronic progressor. As used herein, by a “gene having increased expression” is meant a gene from an HIV-specific T-cell that has increased expression as compared to either a T-cell from an individual who is not infected with HIV or as compared to an HIV-specific T-cell from a controller or as compared to an HIV-specific T-cell from a chronic progressor. These genes are therefore helpful in classifying and/or identifying an HIV infected individual as a controller or a chronic progressor. Examples of such genes are provided herein at FIG. 11. As used herein, by a “gene having decreased expression” is meant a gene from an HIV-specific T-cell that has decreased expression as compared to either a T-cell from an individual who is not infected with HIV or as compared to an HIV-specific T-cell from a controller or as compared to an HIV-specific T-cell from a chronic progressor. These genes are therefore helpful in classifying and/or identifying an HIV infected individual as a controller or a chronic progressor. Examples of such genes are provided herein at FIG. 11. As used herein, gene expression products are proteins, peptides, or nucleic acid molecules (e.g., mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, or cRNA) that are involved in transcription or translation. The present invention can be effectively used to analyze proteins, peptides, or nucleic acid molecules that are involved in transcription or translation. The nucleic acid molecule levels measured can be derived directly from the gene or, alternatively, from a corresponding regulatory gene. All forms of gene expression products can be measured, including, for example, spliced variants. Similarly, gene expression can be measured by assessing the level of protein or derivative thereof translated from mRNA. The sample to be assessed can be any sample that contains a gene expression product. Suitable sources of gene expression products, i.e., samples, can include cells, lysed cells, cellular material for determining gene expression, or material containing gene expression products. Examples of such samples are blood, plasma, lymph, urine, tissue, mucus, sputum, saliva or other cell samples. Methods of obtaining such samples are known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the sample is derived from an individual who has been clinically diagnosed as being infected with HIV. As used herein “obtaining” means acquiring a sample, either by directly procuring a sample from a patient or a sample (tissue biopsy, primary cell, cultured cells), or by receiving the sample from one or more people who procured the sample from the patient or sample. Genes that are particularly relevant for classification have been identified as a result of work described herein and are shown in FIG. 11. The genes that are relevant for classification are referred to herein as “informative genes.” Informative genes can be, for example, all or a subset of the genes shown in FIG. 11. Not all informative genes for a particular class distinction must be assessed in order to classify a sample. Similarly, the set of informative genes for one phenotypic effect may or may not be the same as the set of informative genes for a different phenotypic effect. For example, a subset of the informative genes which demonstrate a high correlation with a class distinction can be used. This subset can be, for example, 1 or more genes, 2 or more genes, 3 or more genes, 4 or more genes, 5 or more genes, 10 or more genes, 25 or more genes, or 50 or more genes. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 or more genes. It will be understood that the methods of the present invention can classify a sample by evaluating a sample for a combination of genes whose expression is increased in HIV-specific T-cells from a controller as compared to a chronic progressor and/or genes that are decreased in HIV-specific T-cells from a controller as compared to a chronic progressor. It will also be understood that the methods of the present invention can classify a sample by evaluating a sample for a combination of genes whose expression is increased in HIV-specific T-cells from a chronic progressor as compared to a controller and/or genes that are decreased in HIV-specific T-cells from a chronic progressor as compared to a controller. It will also be understood that the methods of the present invention can classify a sample by evaluating a sample for a combination of genes whose expression is increased in HIV-specific T-cells from a chronic progressor as compared to a T-cells from a healthy individual and/or genes that are decreased in HIV-specific T-cells from a chronic progressor as compared to T-cells from a healthy individual. It will also be understood that the methods of the present invention can classify a sample by evaluating a sample for a combination of genes whose expression is increased in HIV-specific T-cells from a controller as compared to a T-cells from a healthy individual and/or genes that are decreased in HIV-specific T-cells from a controller as compared to T-cells from a healthy individual. In one embodiment, the gene expression product is a protein or polypeptide. In this embodiment, determination of the gene expression profile can be made using techniques for protein detection and quantitation known in the art. For example, antibodies specific for the protein or polypeptide can be obtained using methods that are routine in the art, and the specific binding of such antibodies to protein or polypeptide gene expression products can be detected and measured. “Gene expression profile” or “expression profile” as used herein is defined as the level or amount of gene expression of particular genes as assessed by methods described herein. The gene expression profile can comprise data for one or more genes and can be measured at a single time point or over a period of time. Phenotype classification (e.g., chronic progressor or controller or treatment outcome) can be made by comparing the gene expression profile of the sample with respect to one or more informative genes with one or more gene expression profiles (e.g., in a database). Informative genes include, but are not limited to, those shown in FIG. 11. Using the methods described herein, expression of numerous genes can be measured simultaneously. The assessment of numerous genes provides for a more accurate evaluation of the sample because there are more genes that can assist in classifying the sample. As discussed above, the sample from which a gene expression profile is determined can be any sample that contains a gene expression product, including cells, lysed cells, cellular material for determining gene expression, or material containing gene expression products. Examples of such samples are blood, plasma, lymph, urine, tissue, mucus, sputum, saliva or other cell samples. In a preferred embodiment, the sample is derived from an individual who has been clinically diagnosed as infected with HIV. In a preferred embodiment, the gene expression product is mRNA and the gene expression levels are obtained, e.g., by contacting the sample with a suitable microarray on which probes specific for all or a subset of the informative genes have been immobilized, and determining the extent of hybridization of the nucleic acid in the sample to the probes on the microarray. Such microarrays are also within the scope of the invention. Examples of methods of making oligonucleotide microarrays are described, for example, in WO 95/11995. Other methods will be readily known to the skilled artisan. Once the gene expression levels of the sample are obtained, the levels are compared or evaluated against the appropriate control, and then the sample is classified. The evaluation of the sample determines whether or not the sample should be assigned to the particular phenotypic class being studied. The gene expression value measured or assessed is the numeric value obtained from an apparatus that can measure gene expression levels. Gene expression levels refer to the amount of expression of the gene expression product, as described herein. The values are raw values from the apparatus, or values that are optionally rescaled, filtered and/or normalized. Such data is obtained, for example, from a GeneChip® probe array or Microarray (Affymetrix, Inc.) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,631,734, 5,874,219, 5,861,242, 5,858,659, 5,856,174, 5,843,655, 5,837,832, 5,834,758, 5,770,722, 5,770,456, 5,733,729, 5,556,752, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety), and the expression levels are calculated with software (e.g., Affymetrix GENECHIP software). Nucleic acids (e.g., mRNA) from a sample which has been subjected to particular stringency conditions hybridize to the probes on the chip. The nucleic acid to be analyzed (e.g., the target) is isolated, amplified and labeled with a detectable label (e.g., 32P or fluorescent label) prior to hybridization to the arrays. Once hybridization occurs, the arrays are inserted into a scanner which can detect patterns of hybridization. The hybridization data are collected as light emitted from the labeled groups which are now bound to the probe array. The probes that perfectly match the target produce a stronger signal than those that have mismatches. Since the sequence and position of each probe on the array are known, by complementarity, the identity of the target nucleic acid applied to the probe is determined. Quantitation of gene profiles from the hybridization of labeled mRNA/DNA microarrays can be performed by scanning the microarrays to measure the amount of hybridization at each position on the microarray with an Affymetrix scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.). For each stimulus, a time series of mRNA levels (C={C1, C2, C3, . . . Cn}) and a corresponding time series of mRNA levels (M={M1, M2, M3, . . . Mn}) in control medium in the same experiment as the stimulus is obtained. Quantitative data is then analyzed. “Ci” and “Mi” are defined as relative steady-state mRNA levels, where “i” refers to the ith timepoint and “n” to the total number of time points of the entire time course. “μM” and “σM” are defined as the mean and standard deviation of the control time course, respectively. Microarrays are only one method of obtaining gene expression values. Other methods for obtaining gene expression values known in the art or developed in the future can be used with the present invention. Once the gene expression values are prepared, the sample can be classified. The correlation between gene expression and class distinction can be determined using a variety of methods. Methods of defining classes and classifying samples are described, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/544,627, filed Apr. 6, 2000 by Golub et al., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In one embodiment, gene expression levels are detected and evaluated for expression levels, where genes without variation (e.g., having 5-fold or less variation between any two samples) are filtered out of the analysis. The information provided by the present invention, alone or in conjunction with other test results, aids in sample classification. In one embodiment, the sample is classified using a weighted voting scheme. The weighted voting scheme advantageously allows for the classification of a sample on the basis of multiple gene expression values. In one embodiment the sample is a sample derived from an HIV-infected subject patient sample. In one aspect, the sample is HIV-specific T-cells derived from an HIV-infected subject. In a preferred embodiment the sample is classified as belonging to a particular treatment outcome class, for example, controllers or chronic progressors. In another embodiment the gene is selected from a group of informative genes, including, but not limited to, the genes listed in FIG. 11. For example, one aspect of the present invention is a method of assigning a sample to a known or putative class, e.g., controller or chronic progressor HIV-infected individuals, comprising determining a weighted vote of one or more informative genes (e.g., greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 genes) for one of the classes in accordance with a model built with a weighted voting scheme, wherein the magnitude of each vote depends on the expression level of the gene in the sample and on the degree of correlation of the gene's expression with class distinction; and summing the votes to determine the winning class. The weighted voting scheme is: [in-line-formulae]Vg=ag(xg−bg),[/in-line-formulae] wherein Vg is the weighted vote of the gene, g; ag is the correlation between gene expression values and class distinction, P(g,c), as defined herein; bg=m1(g)+m2(g))/2 which is the average of the mean log10 expression value in a first class and a second class; xg is the log10 gene expression value in the sample to be tested; and wherein a positive V value indicates a vote for the first class, and a negative V value indicates a negative vote for the class. A prediction strength can also be determined, wherein the sample is assigned to the winning class if the prediction strength is greater than a particular threshold, e.g., 0.3. The prediction strength is determined by: [in-line-formulae](Vwin−Vlose)/(Vwin+Vlose),[/in-line-formulae] wherein Vwin and Vlose are the vote totals for the winning and losing classes, respectively. Moreover, as a consequence of the identification of informative genes for the classification of an HIV-infected subject or prediction of treatment outcome, the present invention provides methods for determining a treatment plan for an individual. That is, a determination of whether an HIV-infected subject is a controller or a chronic progressor or treatment outcome class to which the sample belongs may dictate that a treatment regimen be implemented. For example, once a health care provider knows to which treatment outcome class the sample, and therefore, the individual from which it was obtained, belongs, the health care provider can determine an adequate treatment plan for the individual. For example, in the treatment of a patient whose gene expression profile, as determined by the present invention, correlates with a poor prognosis, a health care provider could utilize a more aggressive treatment for the patient, or at minimum provide the patient with a realistic assessment of his or her prognosis. The present invention also provides methods for monitoring the effect of a treatment regimen in an individual by monitoring the gene expression profile for one or more informative genes. For example, a baseline gene expression profile for the individual can be determined, and repeated gene expression profiles can be determined at time points during treatment. A shift in gene expression profile from a profile correlated with poor treatment outcome to a profile correlated with improved treatment outcome is evidence of an effective therapeutic regimen, while a repeated profile correlated with poor treatment outcome is evidence of an ineffective therapeutic regimen. The invention also provides reference HIV disease expression profiles for a phenotype that is one of: (a) chronic progressor or chronic progressor; or (b) controller. The reference HIV disease reference expression profile is recorded on a computer readable medium. The present invention also provides information regarding the genes that are important in HIV treatment response, thereby providing additional targets for diagnosis and therapy. It is also clear that the present invention can be used to generate databases comprising informative genes which will have many applications in medicine, research and industry, and in particular, in treatment of HIV infection. Also provided are databases of expression profiles of genes useful for characterizing or classifying an immune response of an HIV-infected subjects, and for identifying HIV-specific T-cells that are controllers or chronic progressors. Such databases will typically comprise expression profiles derived HIV-specific T-cell. The expression profiles and databases thereof may be provided in a variety of media to facilitate their use. “Media” refers to a manufacture that contains the expression profile information of the present invention. The databases of the present invention can be recorded on computer readable media, e.g. any medium that can be read and accessed directly by a computer. Such media include, but are not limited to: magnetic storage media, such as floppy discs, hard disc storage medium, and magnetic tape; optical storage media such as CD-ROM; electrical storage media such as RAM and ROM; and hybrids of these categories such as magnetic/optical storage media. One of skill in the art can readily appreciate how any of the presently known computer readable mediums can be used to create a manufacture comprising a recording of the present database information. “Recorded” refers to a process for storing information on computer readable medium, using any such methods as known in the art. Any convenient data storage structure may be chosen, based on the means used to access the stored information. A variety of data processor programs and formats can be used for storage, e.g. word processing text file, database format, etc. As used herein, “a computer-based system” refers to the hardware means, software means, and data storage means used to analyze the information of the present invention. The minimum hardware of the computer-based systems of the present invention comprises a central processing unit (CPU), input means, output means, and data storage means. A skilled artisan can readily appreciate that any one of the currently available computer-based system are suitable for use in the present invention. The data storage means may comprise any manufacture comprising a recording of the present information as described above, or a memory access means that can access such a manufacture. A variety of structural formats for the input and output means can be used to input and output the information in the computer-based systems of the present invention. Such presentation provides a skilled artisan with a ranking of similarities and identifies the degree of similarity contained in the test expression profile. V. BATF BATF is a highly conserved member of the AP-1/ATF family, a group of transcription factors that regulate many aspects of cellular function in the immune system, including cytokine secretion and proliferation30. BATF antagonizes AP-1 function by dimerizing to Jun, disrupting the active Jun:Fos complex of AP-1, and reducing expression of AP-1 target genes20,24,31. Consistent with this, enforced expression of BATF in T cells inhibited the secretion of IL2, an AP-1 dependent gene, but not IFNγ which is not primarily regulated by AP-1. As used herein, “BATF polypeptide” is meant a polypeptide or fragment thereof having at least 85% amino acid identity to NCBI Accession No. NP—006390.1 and having DNA binding activity. As used herein, “BATF nucleic acid molecule” is meant a polynucleotide encoding a BATF polypeptide. An exemplary BATF nucleic acid molecule is provided at NCBI Accession No. NM—006399. V. PD-1 PD-1 is a type I transmembrane protein that is transcriptionally induced in activated T cells, B cells and myeloid cells. The extracellular region of PD-1 consists of a single Ig-like variable (IgV) domain, and the cytoplasmic region contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif. The PD-1 receptor acts to downregulate immune responses and its loss leads to a breakdown of peripheral tolerance (reviewed in Freeman et al., 2000 J. Exp. Med. 192:1027-1034 and US 2006/0034826, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). PD-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin family of molecules (Ishida et al. (1992) EMBO J. 11:3887; Shinohara et al. (1994) Genomics 23:704). PD-1 was previously identified using a subtraction cloning based approach designed to identify modulators of programmed cell death (Ishida et al. (1992) EMBO. J. 11:3887-95; Woronicz et al. (1995) Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 200:137). PD-1 is believed to play a role in lymphocyte survival, e.g., during clonal selection (Honjo (1992) Science 258:591; Agata et al. (1996) Int. Immunology. 8:765; Nishimura et al. (1996) Int. Immunology 8:773). PD-1 was also implicated as a regulator of B cell responses (Nishimura (1998) Int. Immunology 10:1563). Unlike CTLA4, which is found only on T cells, PD-1 is also found on B cells and myeloid cells (reviewed in US 2006/0034826, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). PD-1 molecules are members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. PD-1 (Ishida et al. (1992) EMBO J. 11:3887; Shinohara et al. (1994) Genomics 23:704; U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,520) has an extracellular region containing immunoglobulin superfamily domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular region including an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). These features also define a larger family of molecules, called the immunoinhibitory receptors, which also includes gp49B, PIR-B, and the killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) (Vivier and Daeron (1997) Immunol. Today 18:286). It is often assumed that the tyrosyl phosphorylated ITIM motif of these receptors interacts with S112-domain containing phosphatase, which leads to inhibitory signals. A subset of these immunoinhibitory receptors bind to MHC molecules, for example the KIRs, and CTLA4 bind to B7-1 and B7-2. It has been proposed that there is a phylogenetic relationship between the MHC and B7 genes (Henry et al. (1999) Immunol. Today 20(6):285-8) (reviewed in US 2006/0034826, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). PD-L1 and PD-L2 have been identified as ligands for PD-1 (reviewed in US 2006/0034826). As used herein, the term “activity” with respect to a PD-1 ligand or PD-1 protein includes activities which are inherent in the structure of a PD-1 ligand or PD-1 protein. With regard to PD-1 ligand, the term “activity” includes the ability to modulate immune cell costimulation, e.g., by modulating a costimulatory signal in an immune cell, or to modulate inhibition by modulating an inhibitory signal in an immune cell, e.g., by engaging a natural receptor on an immune cell. When an activating form of the PD-1 ligand binds to a costimulatory receptor, a costimulatory signal is generated in the immune cell. When an activating form of the PD-1 ligand binds to an inhibitory receptor, an inhibitory signal is generated in the immune cell. Modulation of a costimulatory signal results in modulation of effector function of an immune cell. Thus, the term “PD-1 ligand activity” includes the ability of a PD-1 ligand polypeptide to bind its natural receptor(s), the ability to modulate immune cell costimulatory or inhibitory signals, and the ability to modulate the immune response. With respect to PD-1, the term “activity” includes the ability of a PD-1 polypeptide to modulate an inhibitory signal in an immune cell, e.g., by engaging a natural ligand on an antigen presenting cell. PD-1 transmits an inhibitory signal to an immune cell in a manner similar to CTLA4. Modulation of an inhibitory signal in an immune cell results in modulation of proliferation of and/or cytokine secretion by an immune cell. PD-1 can also modulate a costimulatory signal by competing with a costimulatory receptor for binding of a B7 molecule. Thus, the term “PD-1 activity” includes the ability of a PD-1 polypeptide to bind its natural ligand(s), the ability to modulate immune cell costimulatory or inhibitory signals, and the ability to modulate the immune response. PD-1 inhibitors useful according to the invention include but are not limited to soluble monovalent form of PD-1, soluble monovalent form of a PD-1 ligand (for example PD-L1 or PD-L2), antibodies capable of binding to any one of PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2, PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2, antisense or siRNA nucleic acid molecules directed to a nucleic acid encoding any one of PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2, triplex oligonucleotides, a ribozyme, or a recombinant vector for expression of a PD-1 ligand or PD-1 protein, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) of PD-1 or PD-1 ligands, isolated PD-1 ligand or a biologically active portion thereof, PD-1 or PD-1 ligand fusion or chimeric proteins, mutant or altered forms of PD-1 or PD-1 ligands that function as mimetics or antagonists of the respective proteins, and peptidomimetics of PD-1 or PD-1 ligands (reviewed in U.S. 2003/0232323, U.S. 2003/0044768 and U.S. 2006/0034826, incorporated by reference herein in their entirety). VII. Anti-HIV Disease Therapy Antiretroviral or anti-HIV disease therapy can include, but is not limited to, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), protease inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, co-receptor specific agents, 3TC, AZT, nevirapine, non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. HAART can be three or more antiretroviral drugs in combination, including at least one protease inhibitor, or at least a reverse transcriptase inhibitor and a protease inhibitor; or at least two reverse transcriptase inhibitors with at least one protease inhibitor. Typical reverse transcriptase inhibitors include nucleoside analogs, e.g., AZT (Zidovudine), ddi (didanosine), ddc (zalcitabine), D4T (stavudine), 3TC (lamivudine), Ziagen (abacavir), combivir (mix of AZT and 3TC), and non-nucleoside analogs, e.g., viramune (nevirapine), rescriptor (delavirdine), sustiva (efavirenz). Protease inhibitors include invirase (saquinavir), norvir (ritonavir), crixivan (indinavir), viracept (nelfinavir), agenerase (amprenivir), kaletra (lopinavir and ritonavir) and fortovase (saquinavir in a soft gelatin form). Thus, HAART can also be “triple cocktail” therapy. That is, a three drug regimen is used to combat HIV wherein one of the three drugs is usually a protease inhibitor (and the other two are usually reverse transcriptase inhibitors). VIII. Agents The invention provides for agents that modulate (increase or decrease) BATF expression or activity. As used herein, the term “activity” with respect to a BATF binding protein or binding protein, for example JUN or other AP-1 family members or BATF protein includes activities which are inherent in the structure of a BATF binding protein or BATF protein. With respect to BATF, the term “activity” includes the ability of a BATF polypeptide to reduce the expression of AP-1 target genes Also encompassed in the present invention is the use of gene expression profiles to screen for therapeutic agents, for example, agents that modulate (increase or decrease) BATF expression or activity. In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of screening for a therapeutic agent for an individual with HIV disease, comprising isolating a gene expression product from at least one informative gene from one or more cells of the individual with HIV disease; identifying a therapeutic agent by determining a gene expression profile of at least one informative gene before and after administration of the agent, wherein if the gene expression profile from the individual after administration of the agent is correlated with effective treatment of HIV disease, then the agent is identified as a therapeutic agent. In another embodiment, the cells are T-cells. Alternatively, the above method can utilize a cell line derived from an individual with HIV disease. The invention also provides methods (also referred to herein as “screening assays”) for identifying agents or compounds (e.g., fusion proteins, polypeptides, peptidomimetics, prodrugs, receptors, binding agents, antibodies, small molecules or other drugs, nucleic acids. or ribozymes) that alter or modulate (e.g., increase or decrease) the activity of the gene expression products of the informative genes (e.g., polypeptides encoded by the informative genes) as described herein, the expression of informative genes or that otherwise interact with the informative genes and/or polypeptides described herein. Such compounds can be compounds or agents that bind to informative gene expression products described herein (e.g., the polypeptides encoded by the informative genes in FIG. 11), and that have a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on, for example, activity of the polypeptide encoded by an informative gene described herein; or that change (e.g., enhance or inhibit) the ability of a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene to interact with compounds or agents that bind such an informative gene polypeptide; or that alter post-translational processing of such a polypeptide (e.g., agents that alter proteolytic processing to direct the polypeptide from where it is normally synthesized to another location in the cell, such as the cell surface or the nucleus; or agents that alter proteolytic processing such that more polypeptide is released from the cell, etc.). The modulation can be an increase or a decrease in the occurrence, severity, or progression of HIV disease. In addition, an agent that modulates HIV disease includes an agent that binds to a polypeptide that is upstream (earlier) or downstream (later) of the cell signaling events mediated by a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene of the present invention, and thereby modulates the overall activity of the signaling pathway; in turn, the HIV disease state is modulated. The candidate compound can cause an alteration in the activity of a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene of the present invention. For example, the activity of the polypeptide can be altered (increased or decreased) by at least 1.5-fold to 2-fold, at least 3-fold, or, at least 5-fold, relative to the control. Alternatively, the polypeptide activity can be altered, for example, by at least 10%, at least 20%, 40%, 50%, or 75%, or by at least 90%, relative to the control. In one embodiment, the invention provides assays for screening candidate compounds or test agents to identify compounds that bind to or modulate the activity of a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene described herein (or biologically active portion(s) thereof), as well as agents identifiable by the assays. As used herein, a “candidate compound” or “test agent” is a chemical molecule, be it naturally-occurring or artificially-derived, and includes, for example, peptides, proteins, synthesized molecules, for example, synthetic organic molecules, naturally-occurring molecule, for example, naturally occurring organic molecules, nucleic acid molecules, and components thereof. In general, candidate compounds for use in the present invention may be identified from large libraries of natural products or synthetic (or semi-synthetic) extracts or chemical libraries according to methods known in the art. Those skilled in the field of drug discovery and development will understand that the precise source of test extracts or compounds is not critical to the screening procedure(s) of the invention. Accordingly, virtually any number of chemical extracts or compounds can be screened using the exemplary methods described herein. Examples of such extracts or compounds include, but are not limited to, plant-, fungal-, prokaryotic- or animal-based extracts, fermentation broths, and synthetic compounds, as well as modification of existing compounds. Numerous methods are also available for generating random or directed synthesis (e.g., semi-synthesis or total synthesis) of any number of chemical compounds, including, but not limited to, saccharide-, lipid-, peptide-, and nucleic acid-based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available, e.g., from Brandon Associates (Merrimack, N.H.) and Aldrich Chemical (Milwaukee, Wis.). Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal extracts are commercially available from a number of sources, including Biotics (Sussex, UK), Xenova (Slough, UK), Harbor Branch Oceangraphics Institute (Ft. Pierce, Fla.), and PharmaMar, U.S.A. (Cambridge, Mass.). In addition, natural and synthetically produced libraries are generated, if desired, according to methods known in the art, e.g., by standard extraction and fractionation methods. For example, candidate compounds can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: biological libraries; spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the “one-bead one-compound” library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. The biological library approach is limited to polypeptide libraries, while the other four approaches are applicable to polypeptide, non-peptide oligomer or small molecule libraries of compounds (Lam, Anticancer Drug Des., 12: 145 (1997)). Furthermore, if desired, any library or compound is readily modified using standard chemical, physical, or biochemical methods. In addition, those skilled in the art of drug discovery and development readily understand that methods for dereplication (e.g., taxonomic dereplication, biological dereplication, and chemical dereplication, or any combination thereof) or the elimination of replicates or repeats of materials already known for their activities should be employed whenever possible. When a crude extract is found to modulate (i.e., stimulate or inhibit) the expression and/or activity of the informative genes and/or their encoded polypeptides, further fractionation of the positive lead extract is necessary to isolate chemical constituents responsible for the observed effect. Thus, the goal of the extraction, fractionation, and purification process is the careful characterization and identification of a chemical entity within the crude extract having an activity that stimulates or inhibits nucleic acid expression, polypeptide expression, or polypeptide biological activity. The same assays described herein for the detection of activities in mixtures of compounds can be used to purify the active component and to test derivatives thereof. Methods of fractionation and purification of such heterogenous extracts are known in the art. If desired, compounds shown to be useful agents for treatment are chemically modified according to methods known in the art. Compounds identified as being of therapeutic value may be subsequently analyzed using animal models for diseases in which it is desirable to alter the activity or expression of the nucleic acids or polypeptides of the present invention. In one embodiment, to identify candidate compounds that alter the biological activity of a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene as described herein, a cell, tissue, cell lysate, tissue lysate, or solution containing or expressing a polypeptide encoded by the informative gene (e.g., a polypeptide encoded by a gene in FIG. 11), or a fragment or derivative thereof, can be contacted with a candidate compound to be tested under conditions suitable for biological activity of the polypeptide. Alternatively, the polypeptide can be contacted directly with the candidate compound to be tested. The level (amount) of polypeptide biological activity is assessed/measured, either directly or indirectly, and is compared with the level of biological activity in a control (i.e., the level of activity of the polypeptide or active fragment or derivative thereof in the absence of the candidate compound to be tested, or in the presence of the candidate compound vehicle only). If the level of the biological activity in the presence of the candidate compound differs, by an amount that is statistically significant, from the level of the biological activity in the absence of the candidate compound, or in the presence of the candidate compound vehicle only, then the candidate compound is a compound that alters the biological activity of the polypeptide encoded by an informative gene of the invention. For example, an increase in the level of polypeptide biological activity relative to a control, indicates that the candidate compound is a compound that enhances (is an agonist of) the polypeptide biological activity. Similarly, a decrease in the polypeptide biological activity relative to a control, indicates that the candidate compound is a compound that inhibits (is an antagonist of) the polypeptide biological activity. In another embodiment, the level of biological activity of a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene, or a derivative or fragment thereof in the presence of the candidate compound to be tested, is compared with a control level that has previously been established. A level of polypeptide biological activity in the presence of the candidate compound that differs from (i.e., increases or decreases) the control level by an amount that is statistically significant indicates that the compound alters the biological activity of the polypeptide. The present invention also relates to an assay for identifying compounds (e.g., antisense nucleic acids, fusion proteins, polypeptides, peptidomimetics, prodrugs, receptors, binding agents, antibodies, small molecules or other drugs, or ribozymes) that alter (e.g., increase or decrease) expression (e.g., transcription or translation) of an informative gene or that otherwise interact with an informative gene described herein, as well as compounds identifiable by the assays. For example, a solution containing an informative gene can be contacted with a candidate compound to be tested. The solution can comprise, for example, cells containing the informative gene or cell lysate containing the informative gene; alternatively, the solution can be another solution that comprises elements necessary for transcription/translation of the informative gene. Cells not suspended in solution can also be employed, if desired. The level and/or pattern of informative gene expression (e.g., the level and/or pattern of mRNA or protein expressed) is assessed, and is compared with the level and/or pattern of expression in a control (i.e., the level and/or pattern of the informative gene expressed in the absence of the candidate compound, or in the presence of the candidate compound vehicle only). If the expression level and/or pattern in the presence of the candidate compound differs by an amount or in a manner that is statistically significant from the level and/or pattern in the absence of the candidate compound, or in the presence of the candidate compound vehicle only, then the candidate compound is a compound that alters the expression of an informative gene. Enhancement of informative gene expression indicates that the candidate compound is an agonist of informative gene polypeptide activity. Similarly, inhibition of informative gene expression indicates that the candidate compound is an antagonist of informative gene polypeptide activity. In another embodiment, the level and/or pattern of an informative gene in the presence of the candidate compound to be tested, is compared with a control level and/or pattern that has previously been established. A level and/or pattern of informative gene expression in the presence of the candidate compound that differs from the control level and/or pattern by an amount or in a manner that is statistically significant indicates that the candidate compound alters informative gene expression. In another embodiment of the invention, compounds that alter the expression of an informative gene, or that otherwise interact with an informative gene described herein, can be identified using a cell, cell lysate, or solution containing a nucleic acid encoding the promoter region of the informative gene operably linked to a reporter gene. As used herein by “promoter” means a minimal nucleotide sequence sufficient to direct transcription, and by “operably linked” means that a gene and one or more regulatory sequences are connected in such a way as to permit gene expression when the appropriate molecules (e.g., transcriptional activator proteins) are bound to the regulatory sequences. Examples of reporter genes and methods for operably linking a reporter gene to a promoter are known in the art. After contact with a candidate compound to be tested, the level of expression of the reporter gene (e.g., the level of mRNA or of protein expressed) is assessed, and is compared with the level of expression in a control (i.e., the level of expression of the reporter gene in the absence of the candidate compound, or in the presence of the candidate compound vehicle only). If the level of expression in the presence of the candidate compound differs by an amount or in a manner that is statistically significant from the level in the absence of the candidate compound, or in the presence of the candidate compound vehicle only, then the candidate compound is a compound that alters the expression of the informative gene, as indicated by its ability to alter expression of the reporter gene that is operably linked to the informative gene promoter. Enhancement of the expression of the reporter gene indicates that the compound is an agonist of the informative gene polypeptide activity. Similarly, inhibition of the expression of the reporter gene indicates that the compound is an antagonist of the informative gene polypeptide activity. In another embodiment, the level of expression of the reporter in the presence of the candidate compound to be tested, is compared with a control level that has been established previously. A level in the presence of the candidate compound that differs from the control level by an amount or in a manner that is statistically significant indicates that the candidate compound alters informative gene expression. The present invention also features methods of detecting and/or identifying a compound that alters the interaction between a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene and a polypeptide (or other molecule) with which the polypeptide normally interacts with (e.g., in a cell or under physiological conditions). In one example, a cell or tissue that expresses or contains a compound (e.g., a polypeptide or other molecule) that interacts with a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene (such a molecule is referred to herein as a “polypeptide substrate”) is contacted with the informative gene polypeptide in the presence of a candidate compound, and the ability of the candidate compound to alter the interaction between the polypeptide encoded by the informative gene and the polypeptide substrate is determined, for example, by assaying activity of the polypeptide. Alternatively, a cell lysate or a solution containing the informative gene polypeptide, the polypeptide substrate, and the candidate compound can be used. A compound that binds to the informative gene polypeptide or to the polypeptide substrate can alter the interaction between the informative gene polypeptide and the polypeptide substrate by interfering with (inhibiting), or enhancing the ability of the informative gene polypeptide to bind to, associate with, or otherwise interact with the polypeptide substrate. In one embodiment, the polypeptide of interest is BATF and the second interacting polypeptide is JUN or other AP-1 family members. Determining the ability of the candidate compound to bind to the informative gene polypeptide or a polypeptide substrate can be accomplished, for example, by coupling the candidate compound with a radioisotope or enzymatic label such that binding of the candidate compound to the informative gene polypeptide or polypeptide substrate can be determined by directly or indirectly detecting the candidate compound labeled with 125I, 35S, 14C, or 3H, and then detecting the radioisotope (e.g., by direct counting of radioemmission or by scintillation counting). Alternatively, the candidate compound can be enzymatically labeled with, for example, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or luciferase, and the enzymatic label is then detected by determination of conversion of an appropriate substrate to product. In another alternative, one of the other components of the screening assay (e.g., the polypeptide substrate or the informative gene polypeptide) can be labeled, and alterations in the interaction between the informative gene polypeptide and the polypeptide substrate can be detected. In these methods, labeled unbound components can be removed (e.g., by washing) after the interaction step in order to accurately detect the effect of the candidate compound on the interaction between the informative gene polypeptide and the polypeptide substrate. It is also within the scope of this invention to determine the ability of a candidate compound to interact with the informative gene polypeptide or polypeptide substrate without the labeling of any of the interactants. For example, a microphysiometer can be used to detect the interaction of a candidate compound with a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene or a polypeptide substrate without the labeling of either the candidate compound, the polypeptide encoded by the informative gene, or the polypeptide substrate (McConnell et al., Science 257: 1906-1912 (1992)). As used herein, a “microphysiometer” (e.g., CYTOSENSOR™) is an analytical instrument that measures the rate at which a cell acidifies its environment using a light-addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). Changes in this acidification rate can be used as an indicator of the interaction between ligand and polypeptide. In another embodiment of the invention, assays can be used to identify polypeptides that interact with one or more polypeptides encoded by an informative gene. For example, a yeast two-hybrid system such as that described by Fields and Song (Fields and Song, Nature 340: 245-246 (1989)) can be used to identify polypeptides that interact with one or more polypeptides encoded by an informative gene. In such a yeast two-hybrid system, vectors are constructed based on the flexibility of a transcription factor that has two functional domains (a DNA binding domain and a transcription activation domain). If the two domains are separated but fused to two different proteins that interact with one another, transcriptional activation can be achieved, and transcription of specific markers (e.g., nutritional markers such as His and Ade, or color markers such as lacZ) can be used to identify the presence of interaction and transcriptional activation. For example, in the methods of the invention, a first vector is used that includes a nucleic acid encoding a DNA binding domain and a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene, or fragment or derivative thereof, and a second vector is used that includes a nucleic acid encoding a transcription activation domain and a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide that potentially may interact with the informative gene polypeptide, or fragment or derivative thereof. Incubation of yeast containing the first vector and the second vector under appropriate conditions (e.g., mating conditions such as used in the MATCHMAKER™ system from Clontech) allows identification of colonies that express the markers of the polypeptide(s). These colonies can be examined to identify the polypeptide(s) that interact with the polypeptide encoded by the informative gene or a fragment or derivative thereof. Such polypeptides may be useful as compounds that alter the activity or expression of an informative gene polypeptide. In more than one embodiment of the above assay methods of the present invention, it may be desirable to immobilize a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene, or a polypeptide substrate, or other components of the assay on a solid support, in order to facilitate separation of complexed from uncomplexed forms of one or both of the polypeptides, as well as to accommodate automation of the assay. Binding of a candidate compound to the polypeptide, or interaction of the polypeptide with a polypeptide substrate in the presence and absence of a candidate compound, can be accomplished in any vessel suitable for containing the reactants. Examples of such vessels include microtitre plates, test tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes. In one embodiment, a fusion protein (e.g., a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein) can be provided that adds a domain that allows the informative gene polypeptide, or the polypeptide substrate to be bound to a matrix or other solid support. This invention further pertains to novel compounds identified by the above-described screening assays. Accordingly, it is within the scope of this invention to further use a compound identified as described herein in an appropriate animal model. For example, a compound identified as described herein can be used in an animal model to determine the efficacy, toxicity, or side effects of treatment with such a compound. Alternatively, a compound identified as described herein can be used in an animal model to determine the mechanism of action of such a compound. Furthermore, this invention pertains to uses of novel compounds identified by the above-described screening assays for treatments as described herein. In addition, a compound identified as described herein can be used to alter activity of a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene, or to alter expression of the informative gene, by contacting the polypeptide or the nucleic acid molecule (or contacting a cell comprising the polypeptide or the nucleic acid molecule) with the compound identified as described herein. The present invention encompasses a method of treating HIV disease, comprising the administration of an agent which modulates the expression level or activity of an informative gene product, for example. BATF. A therapeutic agent may increase or decrease the level or activity of the gene product. Other suitable therapeutic targets for drug development include genes described herein in FIG. 11. The present invention further relates to antibodies that specifically bind a polypeptide, preferably an epitope, of an informative gene of the present invention (as determined, for example, by immunoassays, a technique well known in the art for assaying specific antibody-antigen binding). Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab′) fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, for example, anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. The term “antibody,” as used herein, refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, and more specifically, molecules that contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds an antigen. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type (for example, IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), and of any class (for example, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of an immunoglobulin molecule. In one embodiment, the antibodies are antigen-binding antibody fragments and include, without limitation, Fab, Fab′ and F(ab)2, Fd, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single-chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv) and fragments comprising either a VL or VH domain. Antigen-binding antibody fragments, including single-chain antibodies, can comprise the variable region(s) alone or in combination with the entirety or a portion of one or more of the following: hinge region, CH1, CH2, and CH3 domains. Also included in the invention are antigen-binding fragments also comprising any combination of variable region(s) with a hinge region, CH1, CH2, and/or CH3 domains. The antibodies of the invention may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably, the antibodies are human, murine, donkey, sheep, rabbit, goat, guinea pig, hamster, horse, or chicken. As used herein, “human” antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies produced by human B cells, or isolated from human sera, human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulins and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,598 by Kucherlapati et al., for example. The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific, bispecific, trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide of the present invention or may be specific for both a polypeptide of the present invention as well as for a heterologous epitope, such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material. Antibodies of the present invention may be described or specified in terms of the epitope(s) or portion(s) of a polypeptide of the present invention that they recognize or specifically bind. The epitope(s) or polypeptide portion(s) may be specified, for example, by N-terminal and/or C-terminal positions, or by size in contiguous amino acid residues. Antibodies that specifically bind any epitope or polypeptide encoded by an informative gene of the present invention may also be excluded. Therefore, the present invention includes antibodies that specifically bind a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene of the present invention, and allows for the exclusion of the same. The term “epitope,” as used herein, refers to a portion of a polypeptide which contacts an antigen-binding site(s) of an antibody or T cell receptor. Specific binding of an antibody to an antigen having one or more epitopes excludes non-specific binding to unrelated antigens, but does not necessarily exclude cross-reactivity with other antigens with similar epitopes. Antibodies of the present invention may also be described or specified in terms of their cross-reactivity. Antibodies of the present invention may not display any cross-reactivity, such that they do not bind any other analog, ortholog, or homolog of a polypeptide of the present invention. Alternatively, antibodies of the invention can bind polypeptides with at least about 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, or 50% identity (as calculated using methods known in the art) to a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene of the present invention. Further included in the present invention are antibodies that bind polypeptides encoded by informative genes that hybridize to an informative gene of the present invention under stringent hybridization conditions, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art. Antibodies of the present invention can also be described or specified in terms of their binding affinity to a polypeptide of the invention. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kd less than 5×10−6 M, 10−6 M, 10−7 M, 10−7 M, 5×10−8 M, 10−8 M, 5×10−9 M, 10−9 M, 5×10−10 M, 10−10 M, 5×10−11 M, 10−11 M, 5×10−12 M, 10−12 M, 5×10−13 M, 10−13 M, 5×10−14 M, 10−14 M, 5×10−15 M, and 10−15 M. The invention also provides antibodies that competitively inhibit binding of an antibody to an epitope of a polypeptide of the invention, as determined by any method known in the art for determining competitive binding, for example, using immunoassays. In particular embodiments, the antibody competitively inhibits binding to the epitope by at least about 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, or 50%. Antibodies of the present invention can act as agonists or antagonists of polypeptides encoded by the informative genes of the present invention. For example, the present invention includes antibodies which disrupt interactions with the polypeptides encoded by the informative genes of the invention either partially or fully. The invention also includes antibodies that do not prevent binding, but prevent activation or activity of the polypeptide. Activation or activity (for example, signaling) may be determined by techniques known in the art. Also included are antibodies that prevent both binding to and activity of a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene. Likewise included are neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies of the present invention may be used, for example, and without limitation, to purify, detect, and target the polypeptides encoded by the informative genes described herein, including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example, the antibodies have use in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides in biological samples. See, for example, Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988). As discussed in more detail below, the antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- and/or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalent and non-covalent conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. For example, antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays, or effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides, drugs, or toxins. The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are modified, for example, by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from recognizing its epitope. For example, but not by way of limitation, the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified, for example, by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, or linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, and metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin. Additionally, the derivative can contain one or more non-classical amino acids. The antibodies of the present invention can be generated by any suitable method known in the art. Polyclonal antibodies to an antigen-of-interest can be produced by various procedures well known in the art. For example, a polypeptide of the invention can be administered to various host animals including, but not limited to, rabbits, mice, rats, or the like, to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. Various adjuvants can be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and include, but are not limited to, Freund's adjuvant (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) and corynebacterium parvum. Such adjuvants are well known in the art. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques also known in the art, including hybridoma cell culture, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques as is known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988). The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein is not necessarily limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology, but also refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone. Human antibodies are desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. These antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. The transgenic mice are immunized with a selected antigen, for example, all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies, see, for example, PCT publications WO 98/24893; WO 96/34096; WO 96/33735; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,413,923; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806; 5,814,318; and 5,939,598. In another embodiment, antibodies to the polypeptides encoded by the informative genes as described herein can, in turn, be utilized to generate anti-idiotype antibodies that “mimic” polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. (See, for example, Greenspan & Bona, FASEB J. 7(5):437-444 (1989) and Nissinoff, J. Immunol. 147(8):2429-2438 (1991)). For example, antibodies that bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and/or binding of a polypeptide to a ligand can be used to generate anti-idiotypes that “mimic” the polypeptide multimerization and/or binding domain and, as a consequence, bind to and neutralize polypeptide and/or its ligand. Such neutralizing anti-idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti-idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize polypeptide ligand. For example, such anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide encoded by an informative gene and/or to bind its ligands, and thereby block its biological activity. The antibodies or fragments thereof of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide to facilitate their purification. In one embodiment, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, an HA tag, or a FLAG tag, as will be readily appreciated by one of skill in the art. The present invention further encompasses antibodies or fragments thereof conjugated to a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. The antibodies can be used diagnostically, for example, to monitor the development or progression of a tumor as part of a clinical testing procedure to determine the efficacy of a given treatment regimen. Detection can be facilitated by coupling the antibody to a detectable substance. Examples of detectable substances include enzymes (such as, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase), prosthetic group (such as streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin), fluorescent materials (such as umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin), luminescent materials (such as luminol), bioluminescent materials (such as luciferase, luciferin, and aequorin), radioactive materials (such as, 125I, 131I, 111In or 99Tc), and positron emitting metals using various positron emission tomographies, and nonradioactive paramagnetic metal ions. In an additional embodiment, an antibody or fragment thereof can be conjugated to a therapeutic moiety such as a cytotoxin, for example, a cytostatic or cytocidal agent, a therapeutic agent or a radioactive metal ion. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples include paclitaxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil decarbazine), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, thioepa chlorambucil, melphalan, carmustine (BSNU) and lomustine (CCNU), cyclothosphamide, busulfan, dibromomannitol, streptozotocin, mitomycin C, and cis-dichlorodiamine platinum (II) (DDP) cisplatin), anthracyclines (for example, daunorubicin (formerly daunomycin) and doxorubicin), antibiotics (for example, actinomycin, bleomycin, mithramycin, and anthramycin (AMC)), and anti-mitotic agents (for example, vincristine and vinblastine). The conjugates of the invention can be used for modifying a given biological response, the therapeutic agent or drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, a toxin such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor, .α-interferon, .β-interferon, nerve growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, tissue plasminogen activator, a thrombotic agent or an anti-angiogenic agent, for example, angiostatin or endostatin; or, biological response modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukins, granulocyte macrophase colony stimulating factor (“GM-CSF”), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (“G-CSF”), or other growth factors. Antibodies of the invention can also be attached to solid supports. These are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the target antigen. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, silicon, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene. Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known in the art, see, for example, Amon et al., “Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer Therapy”, in Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. eds., pp. 243-56 (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985). Alternatively, an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980. An antibody of the invention, with or without conjugation to a therapeutic moiety, administered alone or in combination with cytotoxic factor(s) and/or cytokine(s), can be used as a therapeutic. Antisense antagonists of the informative genes of the present invention are also included. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through antisense DNA or RNA, or through triple-helix formation. Antisense techniques are discussed for example, in Okano, J., Neurochem. 56:560 (1991). The methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. In one embodiment, an antisense sequence is generated internally by the organism, in another embodiment, the antisense sequence is separately administered (see, for example, O'Connor, J., Neurochem. 56:560 (1991)). In one embodiment, the 5′ coding portion of an informative gene can be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. Generally, a DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription thereby preventing transcription and the production of the receptor. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into receptor polypeptide. In one embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid of the invention is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence. For example, a vector or a portion thereof, is transcribed, producing an antisense nucleic acid of the invention. Such a vector contains the sequence encoding the antisense nucleic acid. The vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated, as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology and can be plasmid, viral, or otherwise, as is known to one of skill in the art. Expression can be controlled by any promoter known in the art to act in the target cells, such as vertebrate cells, and preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive and include, without limitation, the SV40 early promoter region (Bernoist and Chambon, Nature 29:304-310 (1981), the promoter contained in the 3′ long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto et al., Cell 22:787-797 (1980)), the herpes thymidine promoter (Wagner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:1441-1445 (1981)), and the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster et al., Nature 296:39-42 (1982)). The antisense nucleic acids of the invention comprise a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of an informative gene. Absolute complementarity, although preferred, is not required. A sequence “complementary to at least a portion of an RNA,” referred to herein, means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA, forming a stable duplex. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid. Generally, the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with the RNA it may contain and still form a stable duplex. One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex. Oligonucleotides that are complementary to the 5′ end of the RNA, for example, the 5′ untranslated sequence up to and including the AUG initiation codon, are generally regarded to work most efficiently at inhibiting translation. However, sequences complementary to the 3′ untranslated sequences of mRNAs have been shown to be effective at inhibiting translation of mRNAs as well. Thus, oligonucleotides complementary to either the 5′- or 3′-non-translated, non-coding regions of a nucleotide sequence can be used in an antisense approach to inhibit mRNA translation. Oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′ untranslated region of the mRNA can include the complement of the AUG start codon. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to mRNA coding regions can also be used in accordance with the invention. In one embodiment, the antisense nucleic acids are at least six nucleotides in length, and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from about 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotide is at least about 10, 17, 25 or 50 nucleotides in length. The antisense oligonucleotides of the invention can be DNA or RNA, or chimeric mixtures, or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone, for example, to improve stability of the molecule, hybridization, and the like. The oligonucleotide can include other appended groups such as peptides (for example, to target host cell receptors in vivo), or agents that facilitate transport across the cell membrane, or the blood-brain barrier, or intercalating agents. The antisense oligonucleotide may comprise at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including, but not limited to, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl) uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, a-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5′-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl)uracil, (acp3)w, and 2,6-diaminopurine. The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including, but not limited to, arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, xylulose, and hexose. In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from the group including, but not limited to, a phosphorothioate, a phosphorodithioate, a phosphoramidothioate, a phosphoramidate, a phosphordiamidate, a methylphosphonate, an alkyl phosphotriester, and a formacetal or analog thereof. In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide is an .α-anomeric oligonucleotide. An .α-anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual .β-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gautier et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:6625-6641 (1987)). The oligonucleotide is a 2′-O-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:613-16148 (1987)), or a chimeric RNA-DNA analog (Inoue et al., FEBS Lett. 215:327-330 (1987)). Antisense oligonucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art, for example, by use of an automated DNA synthesizer. Potential antagonists of informative genes of the present invention also include catalytic RNA, or a ribozyme. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The target mRNA has the following sequence of two bases: 5′-UG-3′. The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach (Nature 334:585-591 (1988)). Preferably, the ribozyme is engineered so that the cleavage recognition site is located near the 5′ end of the mRNA in order to increase efficiency and minimize the intracellular accumulation of non-functional mRNA transcripts. Ribozymes of the invention can be composed of modified oligonucleotides (for example for improved stability, targeting, and the like). DNA constructs encoding the ribozyme can be under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, such as, for example, pol III or pol II promoter, so that a transfected cell will produce sufficient quantities of the ribozyme to destroy endogenous target mRNA and inhibit translation. Since ribozymes, unlike antisense molecules, are catalytic, a lower intracellular concentration is generally required for efficiency. Antagonists of the informative genes of the present invention that function via gene silencing mechanisms are also included. The phrase “gene silencing” refers to a process by which the expression of a specific gene product is lessened or attenuated. Gene silencing can take place by a variety of pathways. Unless specified otherwise, as used herein, gene silencing refers to decreases in gene product expression that results from RNA interference (RNAi), a defined, though partially characterized pathway whereby small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) act in concert with host proteins (e.g., the RNA induced silencing complex, RISC) to degrade messenger RNA (mRNA) in a sequence-dependent fashion. RNA interference (“RNAi”) is a method of post-transcriptional gene regulation that is conserved throughout many eukaryotic organisms. RNAi is induced by short (i.e., <30 nucleotide) double stranded RNA (“dsRNA”) molecules which are present in the cell (Fire A et al. (1998), Nature 391: 806-811). These short dsRNA molecules, called “short interfering RNA” or “siRNA,” cause the destruction of messenger RNAs (“mRNAs”) which share sequence homology with the siRNA to within one nucleotide resolution (Elbashir S M et al. (2001), Genes Dev, 15: 188-200). It is believed that the siRNA and the targeted mRNA bind to an RNA-induced silencing complex (“RISC”), which cleaves the targeted mRNA. The siRNA is apparently recycled much like a multiple-turnover enzyme, with 1 siRNA molecule capable of inducing cleavage of approximately 1000 mRNA molecules. siRNA-mediated RNAi is therefore more effective than other currently available technologies for inhibiting expression of a target gene. RNA interference (RNAi) is a phenomenon wherein double-stranded RNA, when present in a cell, inhibits expression of a gene that has an identical or nearly identical sequence. Inhibition is caused by degradation of the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the target gene. The double-stranded RNA responsible for inducing RNAi is termed interfering RNA. The mechanism and cellular machinery through which dsRNA mediates RNAi has been investigated using both genetic and biochemical approaches. Biochemical analyses suggest that dsRNA introduced into the cytoplasm of a cell is first processed into RNA fragments 21 25 nucleotides long. It has been shown in in vitro studies that these dsRNAs, termed small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are generated at least in part by the RNAse III-like enzyme Dicer. These siRNAs likely act as guides for mRNA cleavage, as the target mRNA is cleaved at a position in the center of the region covered by a particular siRNA. Biochemical evidence suggests that the siRNA is part of a multicomponent nuclease complex termed the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). One of the proteins of this complex, Argonaute2, has been identified as a product of the argonaute gene family. This gene family, which also contains the C. elegans homolog rde-1 and related genes, the N. crassa homolog qde-2, and the Arabidopsis homolog arg-1, has been shown to be required for RNAi through genetic studies. Genetic screens in C. elegans have also identified the mut-7 gene as essential for RNAi. This gene bears resemblance to RNAse D, suggesting that its gene product acts in the mRNA degradation step of the reaction. Elbashir S M et al. (2001), has shown that synthetic siRNA of 21 and 22 nucleotides in length, and which have short 3′ overhangs, can induce RNAi of target mRNA in a Drosophila cell lysate. Cultured mammalian cells also exhibit RNAi with synthetic siRNA (Elbashir S M et al. (2001) Nature, 411: 494-498), and RNAi induced by synthetic siRNA has recently been shown in living mice (McCaffrey A P et al. (2002), Nature, 418: 38-39; Xia H et al. (2002), Nat. Biotech. 20: 1006-1010). The therapeutic potential of siRNA-mediated RNAi has been demonstrated by several recent in vitro studies, including the siRNA-directed inhibition of HIV-1 infection (Novina C D et al. (2002), Nat. Med. 8: 681-686) and reduction of neurotoxic polyglutamine disease protein expression (Xia H et al. (2002)). Therapeutic RNAi has also been demonstrated in human cancer cells by Alan Gewirtz, as described in published U.S. patent application US 2002/0173478. The level of gene silencing can be measured by a variety of means, including, but not limited to, measurement of transcript levels by Northern Blot Analysis, B-DNA techniques, transcription-sensitive reporter constructs, expression profiling (e.g., DNA chips), and related technologies. Alternatively, the level of silencing can be measured by assessing the level of the protein encoded by a specific gene. This can be accomplished by performing a number of studies including Western Analysis, measuring the levels of expression of a reporter protein that has e.g., fluorescent properties (e.g., GFP) or enzymatic activity (e.g., alkaline phosphatases), or several other procedures. The term “miRNA” refers to microRNA. The term “siRNA” refers to small inhibitory RNA duplexes that induce the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. These molecules can vary in length (generally 18-35 base pairs) and contain varying degrees of complementarity to their target mRNA in the antisense strand. Some, but not all, siRNA have unpaired overhanging bases on the 5′ or 3′ end of the sense strand and/or the antisense strand. The term “siRNA” includes duplexes of two separate strands, as well as single strands that can form hairpin structures comprising a duplex region. siRNA may be divided into five (5) groups (non-functional, semi-functional, functional, highly functional, and hyper-functional) based on the level or degree of silencing that they induce in cultured cell lines. As used herein, these definitions are based on a set of conditions where the siRNA is transfected into said cell line at a concentration of 100 nM and the level of silencing is tested at a time of roughly 24 hours after transfection, and not exceeding 72 hours after transfection. In this context, “non-functional siRNA” are defined as those siRNA that induce less than 50% (<50%) target silencing. “Semi-functional siRNA” induce 50-79% target silencing. “Functional siRNA” are molecules that induce 80-95% gene silencing. “Highly-functional siRNA” are molecules that induce greater than 95% gene silencing. “Hyperfunctional siRNA” are a special class of molecules. For purposes of this document, hyperfunctional siRNA are defined as those molecules that: (1) induce greater than 95% silencing of a specific target when they are transfected at subnanomolar concentrations (i.e., less than one nanomolar); and/or (2) induce functional (or better) levels of silencing for greater than 96 hours. These relative functionalities (though not intended to be absolutes) may be used to compare siRNAs to a particular target for applications such as functional genomics, target identification and therapeutics. The siRNA contains sequence that is identical or nearly identical to a portion of a gene. RNA may be polymerized in vitro, recombinant RNA, contain chimeric sequences, or derivatives of these groups. The siRNA may contain ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, synthetic nucleotides, or any suitable combination such that expression of the target gene is inhibited. The RNA is preferably double stranded, but may be single, triple, or quadruple stranded. A delivered siRNA can stay within the cytoplasm or nucleus. The siRNA can be delivered to a cell to inhibit expression of an endogenous or exogenous nucleotide sequence or to affect a specific physiological characteristic not naturally associated with the cell. A siRNA can be delivered to a cell in order to produce a cellular change that is therapeutic. The delivery of siRNA or other genetic material for therapeutic purposes (the art of improving health in an animal including treatment or prevention of disease) is called gene therapy. The siRNA can be delivered either directly to the organism in situ or indirectly by transfer to a cell ex vivo that is then transplanted into the organism. Entry into the cell is required for the siRNA to block the production of a protein or to decrease the amount of a RNA. Delivery of siRNA would block production of the dominant protein thereby lessening HIV disease. By “double stranded RNA” or “dsRNA” is meant a double stranded RNA that matches a predetermined gene sequence that is capable of activating cellular enzymes that degrade the corresponding messenger RNA transcripts of the gene. These dsRNAs are referred to as short intervening RNA (siRNA) and can be used to inhibit gene expression (see for example Elbashir et al., 2001, Nature, 411, 494 498; and Bass, 2001, Nature, 411, 428 429). The term “double stranded RNA” or “dsRNA” as used herein refers to a double stranded RNA molecule capable of RNA interference “RNAi”, including short interfering RNA “siRNA” see for example Bass, 2001, Nature, 411, 428 429; Elbashir et al., 2001, Nature, 411, 494 498; and Kreutzer et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/44895; Zernicka-Goetz et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 01/36646; Fire, International PCT Publication No. WO 99/32619; Plaetinck et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/01846; Mello and Fire, International PCT Publication No. WO 01/29058; Deschamps-Depaillette, International PCT Publication No. WO 99/07409; and Li et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/44914. Drug discovery could also be facilitated by siRNA technology. The siRNA approach for target validation will provide a quicker and less expensive approach to screen potential drug targets. Information for drug targeting will be gained not only by inhibiting a potential drug target but also by determining whether an inhibited protein, and therefore the pathway, has significant phenotypic effects. Expression arrays can be used to determine the responsive effect of inhibition on the expression of genes other than the targeted gene or pathway. It will place the gene product within functional pathways and networks (interacting pathways). Peptidomimetics (Fauchere, J. (1986) Adv. Drug Res. 15:29; Veber and Freidinger (1985) TINS p. 392; and Evans et al. (1987) J. Med. Chem. 30:1229, which are incorporated herein by reference) are usually developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides can be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biological or pharmacological activity), such as human BATF or a BATF binding protein, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: —CH2NH—, —CH2S—, —CH2-CH2-, —CH.dbd.CH— (cis and trans), —COCH2-, —CH(OH)CH2-, and —CH2SO—, by methods known in the art and further described in the following references: Spatola, A. F. in “Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins” Weinstein, B., ed., Marcel Dekker, New York, p. 267 (1983); Spatola, A.

(1982) 31:189-199 (—CH2-S—); each of which is incorporated herein by reference. A particularly preferred non-peptide linkage is —CH2NH—. Such peptide mimetics may have significant advantages over polypeptide embodiments, including, for example: more economical production, greater chemical stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (half-life, absorption, potency, efficacy, etc.), altered specificity (e.g., a broad-spectrum of biological activities), reduced antigenicity, and others. Labeling of peptidomimetics usually involves covalent attachment of one or more labels, directly or through a spacer (e.g., an amide group), to non-interfering position(s) on the peptidomimetic that are predicted by quantitative structure-activity data and/or molecular modeling. Such non-interfering positions generally are positions that do not form direct contacts with the macropolypeptides(s) to which the peptidomimetic binds to produce the therapeutic effect. Derivitization (e.g., labeling) of peptidomimetics should not substantially interfere with the desired biological or pharmacological activity of the peptidomimetic. Also encompassed by the present invention are small molecules. The small molecules of the present invention can be obtained using any of the numerous approaches in combinatorial library methods known in the art, including: spatially addressable parallel solid phase or solution phase libraries; synthetic library methods requiring deconvolution; the ‘one-bead one-compound’ library method; and synthetic library methods using affinity chromatography selection. (Lam, K. S. (1997) Anticancer Drug Des. 12:145). Examples of methods for the synthesis of molecular libraries can be found in the art, for example in: DeWitt et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6909; Erb et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:11422; Zuckermann et al. (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37:2678; Cho et al. (1993) Science 261:1303; Carrell et al. (1994) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Libraries of compounds can be presented in solution (e.g., Houghten (1992) Biotechniques 13:412-421), or on beads (Lam (1991) Nature 354:82-84), chips (Fodor (1993) Nature 364:555-556), bacteria (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), spores (Ladner USP '409), plasmids (Cull et al. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1865-1869) or on phage (Scott and Smith (1990) Science 249:386-390); (Devlin (1990) Science 249:404-406); (Cwirla et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:6378-6382); (Felici (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:301-310); (Ladner supra.). Compounds can be screened in cell based or non-cell based assays. Compounds can be screened in pools (e.g. multiple compounds in each testing sample) or as individual compounds. IX. Assays Cytokine production and secretion is measured in the supernatant of cultured cells according to methods known in the art and including but not limited to using the respective Quantikine Immunoassays according to manufacturer's direction (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). T-cell proliferation can be measured as follows. Primary human CD4-positive or CD8-positive T-cells from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers are isolated via magnetic selection using the CD4 or CD8 isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn Calif.). Cells are labeled with CFSE according to manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) and proliferation detected by loss of CSFE fluorescence after 4-6 days in culture. BATF Expression can be detected by any of the methods of detecting DNA, RNA or protein expression described herein, for Example in Example 4. IX. Methods of Treatment As used herein, “treating” HIV refers to preventing the onset of HIV disease and/or reducing, delaying, or eliminating HIV disease symptoms such as decreased CD4 positive cell count and increased HIV viral load. Alternatively, “treating” means arresting or otherwise ameliorating symptoms of HIV disease as defined herein. According to the methods of the invention, HIV disease is treated, as defined herein by administering to an HIV infected subject an agent that modulates BATF expression or activity. The efficacy of treatment according to a method of the invention can be assessed by monitoring the appearance or severity of HIV disease symptoms, for example, HIV viral load or the number of CD4 positive T cells. Treatment according to the invention is measured by determining viral load, T-cell function, for example IL-2 secretion, T-cell proliferation, T-cell survival, BATF expression or activity or by evaluation of the expression profile of the subject being treated. X. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations The invention provides for compositions and formulations comprising an agent that modulates or inhibits BATF expression activity, admixed with a physiologically compatible carrier. As used herein, “physiologically compatible carrier” refers to a physiologically acceptable diluent such as water, phosphate buffered saline, or saline, and further may include an adjuvant. Adjuvants such as incomplete Freund's adjuvant, aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, or alum are materials well known in the art. The invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions. In addition to the active ingredients, these pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be formulated using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art in dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for ingestion by the subject. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained through combination of active compounds with solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are carbohydrate or protein fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other plants; cellulose such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose; and gums including arabic and tragacanth; and proteins such as gelatin and collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid, or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings such as concentrated sugar solutions, which may also contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for product identification or to characterize the quantity of active compound, i.e., dosage. Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating such as glycerol or sorbitol. Push-fit capsules can contain active ingredients mixed with a filler or binders such as lactose or starches, lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycol with or without stabilizers. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of active compounds. For injection, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer' solution, or physiologically buffered saline. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Additionally, suspensions of the active solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. For nasal administration, penetrants appropriate to the particular barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured in a manner known in the art, e.g. by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levitating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. The pharmaceutical composition may be provided as a salt and can be formed with many acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. . . . Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents that are the corresponding free base forms. In other cases, the preferred preparation may be a lyophilized powder in 1 mM-50 mM histidine, 0.1%-2% sucrose, 2%-7% mannitol at a pH range of 4.5 to 5.5 that is combined with buffer prior to use. After pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in an acceptable carrier have been prepared, they can be placed in an appropriate container and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition with information including amount, frequency and method of administration. The compositions of the present invention include any agent that modulates BATF expression or activity, for example, soluble form of BATF, soluble form of a BATF ligand, antibodies capable of binding to BATF, antisense or siRNA nucleic acid molecules directed to a nucleic acid encoding BATF, triplex oligonucleotides, a ribozyme, or a recombinant vector for expression of a BATF ligand or BATF protein, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) of BATF or BATF ligands, isolated BATF ligand or a biologically active portion thereof, BATF or BATF ligand fusion or chimeric proteins, mutant or altered forms of BATF or BATF ligands that function as mimetics or antagonists of the respective proteins, and peptidomimetics of BATF or BATF ligands. The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated from a range of preferred doses, as necessitated by the condition of the patient being treated. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a given condition is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small amounts until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. Intermittent therapy (e.g., one week out of three weeks or three out of four weeks) may also be used. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be formulated as sustained release or extended release formulations. VII. Dosage and Mode of Administration An agent that modulates BATF expression or activity, may be administered systemically or locally in a dosage wherein administration results in treatment of HIV disease. Systemic administration of the composition according to the invention may be performed by methods of whole-body drug delivery that are well known in the art. These include, but are not limited to, administration orally as well as by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. In some cases it may be desirable to administer the composition directly to the airways in the form of an aerosol. Localized administration of a therapeutic compound according to the invention is preferably by a drip device, drug pump, or drug-saturated solid matrix from which the composition can diffuse once implanted at the target site. Examples of solid carriers include starch, lactose, dicalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose and kaolin, while examples of liquid carriers include sterile water, polyethylene glycols, non-ionic surfactants and edible oils such as corn, peanut and sesame oils, as are appropriate to the nature of the active ingredient and the particular form of administration desired. Advantageously, adjuvants routinely used in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions may be included, including flavoring agents, coloring agents, preserving agents, and antioxidants, for example, vitamin E, ascorbic acid, BHT and BHA. An agent that modulates BATF expression or activity of the invention may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds as a free base or pharmacologically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form is advantageously sterile and fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. Advantageously, the form is stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and is preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. By way of example, a patient suffering from or susceptible to HIV disease, as described herein can be treated as follows. An agent that modulates BATF expression or activity, can be administered to the patient, preferably in a biologically compatible solution or a pharmaceutically acceptable delivery vehicle, by ingestion, injection, inhalation, or any number of other methods. The dosages administered will vary from patient to patient; a “therapeutically effective dose” can be determined, for example, by monitoring the viral load of the patient and/or the number of CD4-positive cells. A therapeutically effective dose refers to a dose wherein the compound has an effect on the treatment of HIV disease. In the treatment of HIV disease, a therapeutically effective dosage regimen should be used. By “therapeutically effective” or “effective amount”, one refers to a treatment regimen sufficient to decrease the viral load of a subject and/or increase the number of CD4-positive cells. Alternatively, a “therapeutically effective regimen” may be sufficient to arrest or otherwise ameliorate symptoms of HIV disease. Generally, in the treatment of HIV disease, an effective dosage regimen requires providing the medication over a period of time to achieve noticeable therapeutic effects. It is contemplated that global administration of a therapeutic composition to an animal is not needed in order to achieve a highly localized effect. Localized administration of a therapeutic composition according to the invention is preferably oral, by injection, catheter or by means of a drip device, drug pump or drug-saturated solid matrix from which the composition can diffuse implanted at the target site. When a tissue that is the target of treatment according to the invention is on a surface of an organism, topical administration of a pharmaceutical composition is possible. For example, antibiotics are commonly applied directly to surface wounds as an alternative to oral or intravenous administration, which methods necessitate a much higher absolute dosage in order to counter the effect of systemic dilution, resulting both in possible side-effects in otherwise unaffected tissues and in increased cost. Compositions comprising a therapeutic composition which are suitable for topical administration can take one of several physical forms, as summarized below: (i) A liquid, such as a tincture or lotion, which may be applied by pouring, dropping or “painting” (i.e. spreading manually or with a brush or other applicator such as a spatula) or injection.(ii) An ointment or cream, which may be spread either manually or with a brush or other applicator (e.g. a spatula), or may be extruded through a nozzle or other small opening from a container such as a collapsible tube.(iii) A dry powder, which may be shaken or sifted onto the target tissue or, alternatively, applied as a nebulized spray.(iv) A liquid-based aerosol, which may be dispensed from a container selected from the group that comprises pressure-driven spray bottles (such as are activated by squeezing), natural atomizers (or “pump-spray” bottles that work without a compressed propellant) or pressurized canisters.(v) A carbowax or glycerin preparation, such as a suppository, which may be used for rectal or vaginal administration of a therapeutic composition.Note that in some cases, the surface in question is internal; in such a case, topical application would comprise taking the therapeutic composition via an oral route, whether in liquid, gel or solid form. Systemic administration of a therapeutic composition according to the invention may be performed by methods of whole-body drug delivery well known in the art. These include, but are not limited to, intravenous drip or injection, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracranial and spinal injection, ingestion via the oral route, inhalation, trans-epithelial diffusion (such as via a drug-impregnated, adhesive patch) or by the use of an implantable, time-release drug delivery device. Note that injection may be performed either by conventional means (i.e. using a hypodermic needle) or by hypospray (see Clarke and Woodland, 1975, Rheumatol. Rehabil., 14: 47-49). Systemic administration is advantageous when a pharmaceutical composition must be delivered to a target tissue that is widely-dispersed, inaccessible to direct contact or, while accessible to topical or other localized application, is resident in an environment (such as the digestive tract) wherein the native activity of the nucleic acid or other agent might be compromised, e.g. by digestive enzymes or extremes of pH. A therapeutic composition of use in the invention can be given in a single- or multiple dose. A multiple dose schedule is one in which a primary course of administration can include 1-10 separate doses, followed by other doses given at subsequent time intervals when it is desirable to maintain and or reinforce the level of the therapeutic agent. Such intervals are dependent on the continued need of the recipient for the therapeutic agent, and/or the half-life of a therapeutic agent. The efficacy of administration may be assayed by monitoring the reduction in the levels of a symptom indicative or associated with HIV disease which it is designed to inhibit. The assays can be performed as described herein or according to methods known to one skilled in the art. A therapeutically effective regimen may be sufficient to arrest or otherwise ameliorate symptoms of a disease. An effective dosage regimen requires providing the regulatory drug over a period of time to achieve noticeable therapeutic effects wherein symptoms are reduced to a clinically acceptable standard or ameliorated. The symptoms are specific for the disease in question. For example, for HIV disease, the claimed invention is successful when HIV viral load is decreased, as defined herein, or when CD4-positive cell number is increased, as defined herein. VIII. Kits or Pharmaceutical Systems The present compositions may be assembled into kits or pharmaceutical systems for use in any one of monitoring the efficacy of anti-HIV therapy, monitoring HIV disease progression, detecting an increase in HIV viral load, detecting a change in the number of CD4+ cells, and treatment of HIV disease. Kits or pharmaceutical systems according to this aspect of the invention comprise a carrier means, such as a box, carton, tube or the like, having in close confinement therein one or more container means, such as vials, tubes, ampules, bottles and the like. The kits or pharmaceutical systems of the invention may also comprise associated instructions for using the agents of the invention, for example an agent that treats HIV. IX. Use The present invention is directed to expression profiles of HIV-specific T-cells and their methods of use, including but not limited to increasing HIV specific T-cell function in HIV infected subjects, increasing the survival of HIV specific T-cells in HIV infected subjects, monitoring the efficacy of an anti HIV therapy in an HIV infected subject, monitoring HIV disease progression, and identifying HIV infected subjects that are controllers or chronic progressor. The present invention is also directed to agents useful for treatment of HIV. Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following Examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention, unless specified. The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the methods of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. EXAMPLES The present invention is described by reference to the following Examples, which are offered by way of illustration and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Standard techniques well known in the art or the techniques specifically described below were utilized. Example 1 Identification of an Evolutionarily Conserved Transcriptional Signature of Exhausted Antigen-Specific CD8+ T Cells Gene expression profiles were generated from populations of tetramer-sorted HIV Gag-specific CD8 T cells from 42 patients; 18 from chronic progressors and 24 from controllers. All patients were off therapy and had detectable HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood (See Table 1), allowing a median of 21,500 HIV Gag tetramer+ T cells (range 3,000-85,000 cells) to be isolated for microarray analysis from each patient (FIG. 7a-d). There was a two-log difference in mean viral load between the two cohorts (FIG. 1a). The distribution of HLA-types (Table 1) and the frequency, memory phenotype, and sorted number tetramer+ cells were not significantly different between the groups (FIGS. 7d and e). The gene expression profiles of Gag-specific CD8+ T cells from chronic progressors showed marked differences to those from controllers (n=518, moderated t-statistic <−2.0, FIG. 1b and Table 1). These tetramer+ gene expression profiles were validated in two ways. First, inspection of the list of genes differentially expressed in either direction revealed genes with known roles in functional or dysfunctional T cell responses. For instance, IL-7R and CD28 were expressed at higher levels in controllers, whereas the inhibitory receptors CD244 and LAG3 were increased in expression in chronic progressors (See Table 1). Second, we found significant similarity at the whole-genome level between dysfunctional CD8+ Gag-specific T cells from progressors and exhausted CD8+ T cells in the mouse model of chronic LCMV infection. We identified the similarity between human and mouse gene expression datasets using an analytical approach called gene set enrichment analysis14. In brief, enrichment analysis asks whether a set of genes of interest (in this case genes upregulated in HIV chronic progressors compared to controllers) tends to occur towards the top (or bottom) of a second list of genes rank ordered based on class distinction (in this case the LCMV exhausted vs. memory signatures). Using this approach we found that the HIV chronic progressor signature was significantly enriched in the LCMV exhausted profiles compared with those of functional LCMV memory T cells (FIG. 1c, P=4.8e-005). Thus the transcriptional program associated with T cell exhaustion is evolutionarily conserved between mice and humans.

PD-1 expressing Jurkat cells were incubated with beads coated with a cross-linking antibody to PD-1 together with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 (PD-1/CD3/CD28 beads); or with beads coated with equivalent amounts of control antibody together with CD3 and CD28 (CD3/CD28 beads). The inclusion of CD3/CD28 induced concomitant TCR signaling and allowed the functional inhibition mediated by PD-1 ligation to be detected. Consistent with previous reports, incubation with PD-1/CD3/CD28 beads significantly decreased production of IL-2 as compared to cells incubated with CD3/CD28 beads (P=0.007, FIG. 2a)9,15. Comparison of microarray data from cells cultured in either condition identified over one thousand genes that were significantly upregulated in cells functionally inhibited by PD-1 (n=1179, t>2.0, FIG. 2b and FIG. 14). A similar number of genes was reduced in expression following PD-1 ligation (n=1361, t<2.0, FIG. 2b and FIG. 14). This pattern of gene expression was validated under more physiologic conditions, by using beads coated with the natural ligand of PD-1, PDL1, as an Ig-fusion protein. Primary human CD4+ T cells were studied to provide a more representative cell type using a quantitative multiplex RT-PCR reaction described previously16,17. 13 representative genes were selected for validation based on their differential expression in PD-1-ligated Jurkat cells. Incubation of human T cells with PDL1-Ig/CD3/CD28 beads led to the coordinate upregulation of these representative PD-1 signature genes in a PDL1-Ig dose-dependent manner (FIG. 2c) compared to resting (not shown) or CD3/CD28 stimulated T cells. Induction of the PD-1 signature correlated with the extent of inhibition of proliferation in the primary T cells (FIG. 2d). Thus ligation of PD-1 in CD3/CD28 stimulated cells induces a specific transcriptional program in both Jurkat cells and primary human T cells. Example 3 PD-1-Induced Genes are Coordinately Upregulated in Exhausted T Cells from Humans and Mice To determine whether the transcriptional program induced by PD-1 signaling defined in vitro could be detected in gene expression profiles from exhausted HIV-specific and LCMV-specific T cells ex vivo it was determined whether PD-1 induced genes were coordinately upregulated in Gag-specific T cells from HIV chronic Progressors, the T cell population in which PD-1-mediated inhibition would be expected to be more pronounced. The top 100 genes that were most upregulated by PD-1 ligation in Jurkat cells were selected. Using enrichment analysis, it was found that this signature of genes was significantly upregulated in the HIV chronic progressors compared with controllers (FIG. 3a, P=5e-006). Similar results were obtained for PD-1-induced gene sets of 50 and 200 genes (data not shown). Interestingly, this difference was in contrast to the expression of PD-1 itself, which was equivalent as measured by microarray analysis between the two cohorts (Supplementary FIG. 2). These data demonstrate that coordinate upregulation of a signature of genes induced by PD-1 ligation occurs in exhausted HIV-specific T cells, even when upregulation of individual genes associated with T cell exhaustion is not be detected for biological or technical reasons. To determine whether this finding could be generalized to other populations of exhausted T cells enrichment analysis was used. Using enrichment analysis, it was found that PD-1 signature genes were significantly upregulated in exhausted LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells compared with their functional memory counterparts (FIG. 3b, P=2e-004). Thus upregulation of PD-1 induced genes may be a hallmark of T cell exhaustion in humans and mice. Expression of PD-1 signature genes was sufficiently dissimilar between chronic progressors and controllers that the signature could effectively distinguish between the two classes of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. The ability of PD-1 signature genes to differentiate HIV-specific T cells from chronic progressors and controllers was tested using two analytic methods. First, hierarchical clustering in the space of the PD-1 signature genes was performed (FIG. 3c). In this unsupervised approach, two main clusters of samples were apparent (colored blue and red, FIG. 3c) which contained either predominantly controller samples (blue cluster) or chronic progressor samples (red cluster). Second, the accuracy with which PD-1 signature genes distinguished each class of tetramer+ samples was quantified. Classification models were applied to the data, and the model with the best performance was a Bayesian model averaging of linear models42. This gene expression classifier correctly identified samples from chronic progressors and controllers with an accuracy of 81% (FIG. 3d). Alteration of PD-1 signature genes is therefore a distinguishing feature of T cell dysfunction in HIV. Example 4 BATF is Induced by PD-1 Ligation and is Increased in Expression in Exhausted T Cells from Humans and Mice To determine if genes upregulated by PD-1 in exhausted cells might include those involved in the inhibition of T cell function, genes that were both upregulated by PD-1 ligation in Jurkat cells and increased in HIV chronic progressors compared with controllers (t<2.0 and t<−2.0, respectively, FIG. 4a and Supplementary Table 15) were identified. Because of their broad effect on cellular function transcription factors were the focus of these studies. Of the 75 genes common to both gene sets, only three were transcription factors: BATF, STAT1 and IRF9 (FIG. 4a and Supplementary List 3). BATF was selected for further analysis because it has been observed to be upregulated during CD8+ memory differentiation in humans and mice16, and because it has been shown to function as a negative regulator of AP-1 activity20,21. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm that PD-1 ligation induced BATF expression in primary human T cells. BATF expression showed a 3-4 fold increase in expression after incubation PDL1/CD3/CD28 beads compared with CD3/CD28 beads, indicating that BATF expression is increased by PD-1 ligation (P<0.0001 and P<0.001, respectively, FIG. 4b). High BATF levels were seen in antigen-specific T cells with the greatest degree of dysfunction. As we have previously described22, BATF expression was lowest in naïve human CD8 T cells and was not significantly different in naïve CD8 T cells from controllers or chronic progressors (P=NS, FIG. 4c). However, BATF expression was significantly higher in exhausted Gag-specific CD8 T cells from chronic progressors than in HIV-specific T cells from controllers (P=0.003, FIG. 4c). CD8+ T cells from the LCMV model of acute and chronic viral infection were evaluated. In chronic infection, PD-1 surface expression defines two subpopulations of exhausted LCMV-specific T cells: PDhi and PD-1int. Of the two, PD-1hi T cells are more terminally differentiated and cannot be rescued by PD-1 pathway blockade23. Consistent with this, BATF levels were significantly higher in the PD-1hi subset than in the PD-1int subset (P=0.026, FIG. 4d). BATF expression was greater in either exhausted subset than in functional memory CD8+ T cells from acute infection (P=0.018). Thus in humans and mice, BATF levels are highest in antigen-specific T cells with poorest function. Genes that are known to anti-correlate with BATF22 were identified. This allowed for establishment of a set of genes that would include putative targets of BATF repression in an independent microarray dataset of human T cells. The top 200 genes whose expression was most anti-correlated with BATF were selected. Using enrichment analysis, it was found that BATF anti-correlated genes were significantly increased in HIV controllers compared with chronic progressors (Supplementary FIG. 3, P=4e-006), consistent with the idea that BATF functions as a transcriptional repressor in HIV-specific T cells from chronic progressors. Example 5 Overexpression of BATF in Primary Human T Cells Recapitulates PD-1-Mediated T Cell Exhaustion Previous data have demonstrated a role for BATF in inhibiting murine thymocyte proliferation24. BATF was overexpressed in primary human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using lentiviral transduction to determine whether BATF inhibited T cell function. T cells transduced with this method consistently showed a 3-5 fold increase in BATF expression over endogenous levels (FIG. 10). This extent of overexpression was in the physiologic range because it is similar to the difference seen in BATF levels between exhausted T cells and functional T cells in humans and mice, as well as to that induced by PD-1 ligation in vitro, (FIG. 4b-d). Overexpression of BATF in primary human T cells markedly reduced proliferation in response to CD3/CD28 (P=0.002, FIGS. 5a and b). Apoptosis was also slightly increased in BATF overexpressing cells following stimulation, consistent with the previous defined role of PD-1 signaling in reducing cell survival25 (P=0.013, FIGS. 5a and b). Overexpression of BATF also significantly reduced IL-2 secretion following CD3/CD28 stimulation, (P=4.5e-005 FIG. 5c). However, BATF overexpression was not overtly toxic to T cells because IFN-γ secretion was not significantly reduced compared with vector controls. Thus increased expression of BATF reduces proliferation and IL2 secretion but not IFN-γ secretion, recapitulating features of exhausted T cells. Example 6 Reducing BATF Expression Partially Rescues PD-1 Mediated T Cell Dysfunction To determine whether BATF is required for PD-1-mediated inhibition of T cell function, PD-1-expressing Jurkat cells were transduced with shRNA sequences directed at BATF, effectively reducing levels of BATF transcript and protein to −10-20% of endogenous levels (FIG. 5d). Compared with control hairpins, depletion of BATF in Jurkats with two different hairpins markedly increased IL2 secretion in PD-1/CD3/CD28 treated cells (P=0.03, FIG. 5e), reversing inhibition almost to levels seen in CD3/CD28 stimulated cells. Moreover, when the analysis was extended to additional hairpins with less efficient knockdown of BATF, it was found that the extent of BATF depletion correlated with the degree of rescue of PD-1 mediated inhibition in Jurkat cells (FIG. 5f). The ability of BATF depletion to rescue inhibition mediated by PD-L1 in primary T cells was determined. shRNA-mediated reduction of BATF in primary CD8+ T cells from healthy donors significantly increased proliferation in PD-L1-inhibited cells almost to levels seen in CD3/CD28 stimulated cells. Thus BATF depletion rescues PD-1 mediated inhibition of IL2 secretion and proliferation in cell lines and primary CD8+ T cells. Example 7 Silencing BATF Improves HIV-Specific T Cell Function Whether silencing BATF would improve the function of HIV-specific T cells was tested. HIV-specific T cell function after BATF knockdown (FIGS. 6A and 6B) was assessed by measuring cytokine secretion or proliferation in response to Gag peptides. BATF knockdown caused a significant increase in CD8+ Gag-specific IFN-γ secretion (FIG. 6C) compared to a control siRNA pool. BATF knockdown increased IFN-γ secretion an average of 60% (P<0.0001). Similar results were seen in HIV-specific CD4+ T cells where silencing BATF caused a two-fold increase in Gag-specific IL-2 secretion (P=0.008, FIG. 6D) and a trend towards increase IFN-γ secretion (P=0.078, FIG. 6E). HIV-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation was also increased by BATF knockdown, with a 5-fold increase in proliferating cells incubated with optimal Gag peptides (P=0.004, FIG. 6F). These data demonstrate that reducing BATF expression therefore increases the function of exhausted HIV-specific T cells. Example 8 Exhausted CD8+ T Cells Display Increased Upregulation of PD-1 Signature Genes Compared to Human Virus-Specific CD8+ Cells Associated with Functional T Cell Responses The upregulation of PD-1 signature genes in exhausted CD8+ T cells contrasted with that seen in profiles of human virus-specific CD8+ T cells associated with functional T cell responses. Using single-sample GSEA, we found that the PD-1 signature was significantly more enriched in HIV-specific CD8+ T cells than in antigen-specific CD8+ T cells specific for CMV (P<0.01), EBV (P<0.001), or influenza virus (P<0.001) from healthy HIV-uninfected donors (FIG. 17). Notably, the PD-1 signature was significantly more enriched in HIV-specific T cells than in EBV-specific T cells, despite the fact EBV-specific T cells express PD-1. Example 9 BATF Expression Kinetics Temporally Correlates with Upregulation of PD-1 In order to define the kinetics of BATF expression following infection with a persistent virus, BATF expression in murine virus-specific CD8+ T cells was compared during acute and chronic infection (FIG. 18A). As early as day 8 post-infection, DbGP33-specific CD8+ T cells in Cl13 infection expressed significantly higher levels of BATF than in Arm infection (P=0.02). BATF expression was maintained at higher levels in virus-specific cells in Cl13 infection at day 15 and by day 30 was −7 fold higher than in DbGP33-specific CD8+ T cells generated during LCMV Arm infection (P=0.02). The increased expression of BATF during acute and chronic infection was coincident with the upregulation of PD-1 as GP33-specific T cells showed increased levels of both PD-1 and BATF by day 8 (FIGS. 18A and 18B). Increased BATF expression is therefore an early and persistent feature of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the setting of chronic viral infection in vivo and correlates, at least temporarily, with upregulation of PD-1. Example 10 Silencing of BATF Increases IL-2 Expression in PD-1 Jurkat Cells Whether depletion of BATF enhances T cell function was examined using shRNA-mediated gene-silencing (FIGS. 19A and 19B). Compared with control hairpins, depletion of BATF in Jurkat cells with two different shRNA sequences (FIG. 19A) significantly increased IL-2 expression in cells cultured with PD-1/CD3/CD28 (P<0.01, FIG. 19A). Particularly, inhibition was reversed to levels seen in CD3/CD28 stimulated cells. Testing additional hairpin sequences showed that there was a strong correlation between the extent of knockdown and degree of increase in IL-2 secretion, confirming the on-target specificity of BATF silencing (RS −0.82, P=0.056; FIG. 19B). BATF silencing also increased IL-2 expression in cells stimulated with CD3/CD28 without exogenous PD-1 cross-linking (P<0.01, FIG. 19A), indicating that pathways in addition to PD-1 could inhibit cell activation via BATF. Consistent with this, the expression of BATF across 42 samples of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells correlated significantly with expression levels of several receptors with known or putative inhibitory function. Materials and Methods Subjects and Samples Subjects were recruited from outpatient clinics at local Boston hospitals, and referred from providers throughout the US, following institutional review board approval and written informed consent. HIV controllers included elite controllers (n=20) with HIV RNA below the level of detection in the absence of antiviral therapy (ARV) for the respective available ultrasensitive assay (e.g., <75 copies per ml by bDNA or <50 copies per ml by ultrasensitive PCR); and viremic controllers (n=4) with HIV RNA levels without ARVs <2000 copies per ml. Chronic progressors were defined as having HIV RNA levels without ARVs above 2,000 copies (Table 1). To qualify as an HIV controller, each subject had to have a minimum of 3 determinations within the respective range of HIV plasma RNA spanning at least a 12-month period. Flow Cytometry and Sorting PBMC were isolated via density centrifugation and were stained with a cocktail of antibodies chosen to exclude irrelevant lineages and dead cells, anti-CD8 and MHC Class I HIV-Gag-specific tetramers to identify the antigen-specific populations, and antibodies against CD62L and CD45RA to characterize the memory phenotype populations of the tetramer+ fraction. CD8+tetramer+ cells were sorted using a FACSAria Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). Following sorting, cells were pelleted and resuspended in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Experiments with Annexin V staining were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). All experiments examining proliferation via CFSE dilution were collected on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Analysis of flow cytometry data was carried out using FlowJo software (version 8.8.6, Tree Star) Cell Culture PD-1 expressing Jurkat cells were generated by transduction with a lentivirus expressing full-length PD-1, and maintained in RPMI 1640 (MediaTech, Manassas, Va.) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah), 1% of both pen/strep and L-glutamine, 16.6 ug/ml gentamicin (Gibco/Invitrogen) and 10 ug/ml blasticidin (InvivoGen, San Diego, Calif.). Primary human CD4 or CD8 T cells from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers were isolated via magnetic selection using the CD4 or CD8 isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, Calif.). In most cases, cells were labeled with CFSE according to manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). 293FT cells used to generate lentivirus particles were maintained in DMEM (MediaTech) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Hyclone), 1% of both pen/strep and L-glutamine and 16.6 ug/ml gentamicin (Gibco/Invitrogen). Microarray Data Acquisition and Analysis Tetramer-sorted human CD8 T cells, Jurkat cells following 18 h of stimulation were resuspended in TRIzol. RNA extraction was performed using the RNAdvance Tissue Isolation kit (Agencourt). Concentrations of total RNA were determined using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Wilmington, Del.) or via the Ribogreen RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). RNA purity was determined by Bioanlyzer 2100 traces (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif.). Total RNA was amplified using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification system (NuGEN, San Carlos, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following fragmentation and biotinylation, cDNA was hybridized to Affymetrix HT HG-U133A or HG-U133A2.0 microarrays. Prior to analysis, microarray data was pre-processed and normalized using robust multi-chip averaging, as previously described22. Differentially expressed genes between classes were ranked using Smyth's variance-moderated t-test40. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using GenePattern41. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed as previously described using the Zhang statistic as implemented in the program RenderCat14. For the classification of chronic progressor vs. controller samples using PD-1 signature genes, we tested various classification models including support vector machine and Bayesian model averaging of linear models, probit models or logistic models as we have previously described42. Linear models provided the superior classification performance, and predictor accuracy was tested using leave-one-out cross validation. Quantitative PCR Expression of BATF following in vitro stimulation of primary human T cells, shRNA and overexpression experiments was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Briefly, RNA was isolated from cells resuspended in TRIzol and cDNA was generated from a reverse transcription reaction using the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Normalized BATF expression was then determined in a real-time PCR reaction using Taqman gene expression assays for BATF (assay #Hs00232390_m1) and β-actin (Hs00357333_g1) which served as a loading control. Quantitative multiplex RT-PCR via ligation-mediated amplification was carried out as previously described16. PD-1 signature genes were selected for the multiplex validation panel based using criteria previously established16 and sequences for primer sets are available upon request. Lentiviral Vectors and Transduction Lentiviral vectors encoding shRNA hairpin sequences targeting BATF or GFP as control as well as a puromycin resistance cassette in the pLKO.1 backbone were obtained from The RNAi Consortium (TRC, http://broadinstitute.org/rnai/trc) of the Broad Institute (Cambridge, Mass.). The lentiviral vector used to overexpress BATF was generated by gateway cloning of full-length human BATF cDNA (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, Ala.) into the pLenti6.2/V5-DEST vector that includes a blasticidin resistance cassette (Invitrogen). Lentivirus-containing supernatant was generated according to TRC protocols (http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/trc/lib) via a lipid-based delivery system using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, Wis.) and 293FT cells provided by the TRC. For lentiviral transduction of primary human T cells, following isolation and CFSE labeling, cells were placed at a concentration of 2×106 cells/well in 24 well plates previously coated with 2.5 ug/ml of anti-CD3 (OKT3 clone, eBiosciences, San Diego, Calif.) and anti-CD28 (CD28.2 clone, BD Biosciences) antibodies in media comprised of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% of pen/strep, L-glutamine and HEPES and 16.6 ug/ml gentamicin (Gibco/Invitrogen), in the presence of 20 U/ml recombinant human IL-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Following 2 days of stimulation, cells were counted and placed in wells of a 96 well U-bottom plate at a concentration of 2×105 cells per well in media supplemented with 8 □g/ml of polybrene (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 20 U/ml rhlL-2 together with lentivirus-containing supernatant at an MOI of 1. Transduction occurred via a 90 min spin infection at 2250 rpm at 37° C., after which the lentivirus-containing supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh media supplemented with 20 U/ml rhlL-2. At day 2 following transduction, media containing selection reagents, (puromycin for shRNA vectors and blasticidin for overexpression vectors), as well as IL-2 was added and selection was allowed to occur for a total of 5 days. All subsequent experiments with lentivirus-transduced T cells were conducted in the absence of IL-2. Bead Preparation Beads used for cell stimulation were generated by conjugation of anti-CD3 (64 ng, clone UCHT1) and anti-CD28 (80 ng, clone CD28.2) as well as either control IgG1 (1.25 ug clone MOPC-31C) (all from BD Biosciences) for positive CD3/CD28 beads or either an anti-human PD-1 antibody (1.25 ug, clone EH12) or PDL1-Ig fusion protein (1.25 ug, both gifts from G. Freeman) for PD1/CD3/CD28 or PDL1/CD3/CD28 beads, respectively, to CELLection Pan Mouse IgG beads (Invitrogen/Dynal, Oslo, Norway). For PDL1-Ig titration experiments, the amount of PDL1-Ig conjugated to the beads was decreased in 2-fold increments while IgG1 was added to maintain equivalent amounts of total protein on the beads (1.394 ug total protein). Conjugation occurred over a 90 minute incubation period at 4° C. with constant end-over-end rotation in PBS supplemented with 0.1% FBS. Following incubation, beads were washed twice to remove unbound antibody and stored at 4° C. in the 0.1% FBS-containing PBS prior to use. Cytokine Measurement Using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) IL-2 and IFN-γ production was measured in the supernatant of cultured primary human T cells or Jurkat cells using the respective Quantikine Immunoassays according to manufacturer's direction (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). BATF siRNA Knockdown in PBMC and HIV-Specific CD4 T Cell Responses Freshly isolated PBMC from untreated, chronically HIV-infected individuals were depleted of CD8+ T cells during density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Histopaque, Sigma Aldrich) using RosetteSep CD8 depletion reagents (StemCell). Inhibition of BATF expression was achieved through siRNA transfection by electroporation on a Gene Pulser XCell (BioRad). Fifteen million cells were resuspended in 300 ml of Opti-MEM in a 2-mm cuvette and pulsed with 1 nmol of siRNA (ON-TARGET Non-targeting pool and BATF ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool, Dharmacon). The pulse conditions were designed to maximize electroporation efficiency in T cells (a unique square wave with a pulse of 360V and a duration of 5 ms), and routinely achieved approximately 80% electroporation efficiency. After electroporation, cells were rested overnight in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% human AB serum (Gemini Bioproducts) at 37° C., 5% CO2 before being stimulated with an HIV Gag peptide pool (1 mg/ml/peptide) or left unstimulated. Input cell numbers were normalized at 1 million cells/mL of culture medium per condition. After a 96-hour incubation, IFN-γ and IL-2 levels were measured in the collected supernatants with the Milliplex High sensitivity Kit (Millipore) using the Bio-Plex 200 system (BioRad) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
