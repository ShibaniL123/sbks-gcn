A mixture of pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (7.75 g, 20 mmol), 4-fluorophenol (7.84 g, 70 mmol), potassium carbonate (13.80 g, 100 mmol), and DMF (40 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 100Â° C. for 68 h. After aqueous work-up, the reaction mixture was chromatographed (silica gel, hexane/DCM, 3:1) to give Compound F1, 4,4'-((2-(bromomethyl)-2-((4-fluorophenoxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(fluorobenzene), (3.92 g, 41% yield).
