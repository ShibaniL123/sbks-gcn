Reference Example 5 Synthesis of tert-butyl 4-(6-aminopyridin-3-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate
The tert-butyl 4-(6-nitropyridin-3-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate synthesized in Reference Example 4 (83 g, 269 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (1.3 L) in Parr Shaker and Raney nickel (15 g, 50% aqueous suspension) was added thereto. The resultant reaction mixture was stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere (50 psi) for five hours. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite pad to separate solid,and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant solid was suspended in diethyl ether (120 mL) and stirred for four hours. Heptane was added to the suspension and cooled at 0Â°C for 45 minutes. The resultant solid was separated by filtration and dried under reduced pressure to yield the title compound (62.5 g, 83%).
