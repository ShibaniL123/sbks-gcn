BACKGROUND Development of alternatives to existing polycarbonates, polyesters and polyestercarbonates that maintain properties (e.g., low cost, low color, high transparency and good melt stability) of the corresponding polymers are of great interest in the plastics industry and for the manufacturing industry. To achieve this, a suitable monomer for polymerization reactions is necessary to produce a polymer with the necessary properties. Preliminary studies of phenylindane dicarboxylic acid (PIDA) monomers indicate that PIDA could serve as a potential alternate monomer in synthesizing new polymers with the necessary properties. However, traditional synthesis methods of PIDA, which require rigorous reaction condition requirements, for example, use of propylene gas, high pressure, and high temperature, coupled with the lack of chemo-selectivity of PIDA, restricts the scale-up of PIDA in large quantities. Accordingly, there remains a need for improved, efficient, scalable, and cost effective methods for the synthesis of PIDA, which in turn can be readily used in the production of environmentally-friendly alternatives to existing polycarbonates, polyesters and polyestercarbonates. These needs and other needs are satisfied by the various aspects of the present disclosure. SUMMARY The present disclosure relates to phenylindane dicarboxylic acid (PIDA) monomers and methods of making the same. The method for making the PIDA monomers comprises: a) reacting an alkylstyrene under first reaction conditions effective to provide a first reaction product comprising at least one phenylindane; and b) reacting the first reaction product under second reaction conditions effective to provide a second reaction product comprising at least one phenylindane dicarboxylic acid (PIDA) monomer. The PIDA monomers can be used in the production of polymer compositions exhibiting properties such as low cost, high transparency and good melt stability. The resulting polymer compositions can be used in the manufacture of articles requiring materials with low cost, high transparency, and good melt stability. In one aspect, the disclosure relates to polymer compositions comprising: repeating units derived from at least one PIDA monomer according to the present disclosure. In various further aspects, the disclosure relates to thermoplastic compositions comprising the disclosed PIDA monomers. In various further aspects, the disclosure relates to articles comprising the disclosed compositions. In a further aspect, the disclosure relates to methods of making the disclosed compositions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the disclosure and the Examples included therein. Before the present compounds, compositions, articles, systems, devices, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that they are not limited to specific synthetic methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular reagents unless otherwise specified, as such can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, example methods and materials are now described. Moreover, it is to be understood that unless otherwise expressly stated, it is in no way intended that any method set forth herein be construed as requiring that its steps be performed in a specific order. Accordingly, where a method claim does not actually recite an order to be followed by its steps or it is not otherwise specifically stated in the claims or descriptions that the steps are to be limited to a specific order, it is no way intended that an order be inferred, in any respect. This holds for any possible non-express basis for interpretation, including: matters of logic with respect to arrangement of steps or operational flow; plain meaning derived from grammatical organization or punctuation; and the number or type of aspects described in the specification. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited. A. DEFINITIONS It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. As used in the specification and in the claims, the term “comprising” can include the aspects “consisting of” and “consisting essentially of” Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. In this specification and in the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined herein. As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a polycarbonate polymer” includes mixtures of two or more polycarbonate polymers. As used herein, the term “combination” is inclusive of blends, mixtures, alloys, reaction products, and the like. Ranges can be expressed herein as from one particular value, and/or to another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent ‘about,’ it will be understood that the particular value forms another aspect. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as “about” that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value “10” is disclosed, then “about 10” is also disclosed. It is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed. As used herein, the terms “about” and “at or about” mean that the amount or value in question can be the value designated some other value approximately or about the same. It is generally understood, as used herein, that it is the nominal value indicated ±10% variation unless otherwise indicated or inferred. The term is intended to convey that similar values promote equivalent results or effects recited in the claims. That is, it is understood that amounts, sizes, formulations, parameters, and other quantities and characteristics are not and need not be exact, but can be approximate and/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. In general, an amount, size, formulation, parameter or other quantity or characteristic is “about” or “approximate” whether or not expressly stated to be such. It is understood that where “about” is used before a quantitative value, the parameter also includes the specific quantitative value itself, unless specifically stated otherwise. As used herein, the terms “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. For example, the phrase “optionally substituted alkyl” means that the alkyl group can or cannot be substituted and that the description includes both substituted and unsubstituted alkyl groups. As used herein, the term “effective amount” refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired modification of a physical property of the composition or material. For example, an “effective amount” of a filler refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired improvement in the property modulated by the formulation component, e.g. achieving the desired level of modulus. The specific level in terms of wt % in a composition required as an effective amount will depend upon a variety of factors including the amount and type of polycarbonate, amount and type of polycarbonate, amount and type of thermally conductive filler, and end use of the article made using the composition. Disclosed are the components to be used to prepare the compositions of the disclosure as well as the compositions themselves to be used within the methods disclosed herein. These and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of each various individual and collective combinations and permutation of these compounds cannot be explicitly disclosed, each is specifically contemplated and described herein. For example, if a particular compound is disclosed and discussed and a number of modifications that can be made to a number of molecules including the compounds are discussed, specifically contemplated is each and every combination and permutation of the compound and the modifications that are possible unless specifically indicated to the contrary. Thus, if a class of molecules A, B, and C are disclosed as well as a class of molecules D, E, and F and an example of a combination molecule, A-D is disclosed, then even if each is not individually recited each is individually and collectively contemplated meaning combinations, A-E, A-F, B-D, B-E, B-F, C-D, C-E, and C—F are considered disclosed. Likewise, any subset or combination of these is also disclosed. Thus, for example, the sub-group of A-E, B-F, and C-E would be considered disclosed. This concept applies to all aspects of this application including, but not limited to, steps in methods of making and using the compositions of the disclosure. Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that can be performed it is understood that each of these additional steps can be performed with any specific aspect or combination of aspects of the methods of the disclosure. References in the specification and concluding claims to parts by weight of a particular element or component in a composition or article, denotes the weight relationship between the element or component and any other elements or components in the composition or article for which a part by weight is expressed. Thus, in a compound containing 2 parts by weight of component X and 5 parts by weight component Y, X and Y are present at a weight ratio of 2:5, and are present in such ratio regardless of whether additional components are contained in the compound. As used herein the terms “weight percent,” “wt %,” and “wt. %,” which can be used interchangeably, indicate the percent by weight of a given component based on the total weight of the composition, unless otherwise specified. That is, unless otherwise specified, all wt % values are based on the total weight of the composition. It should be understood that the sum of wt % values for all components in a disclosed composition or formulation are equal to 100. Compounds are described using standard nomenclature. For example, any position not substituted by any indicated group is understood to have its valence filled by a bond as indicated, or a hydrogen atom. A dash (“-”) that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, —CHO is attached through carbon of the carbonyl group. Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. The term “alkyl group” as used herein is a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, t butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, decyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, eicosyl, tetracosyl and the like. A “lower alkyl” group is an alkyl group containing from one to six carbon atoms. The term “aryl group” as used herein is any carbon-based aromatic group including, but not limited to, benzene, naphthalene, etc. The term “aromatic” also includes “heteroaryl group,” which is defined as an aromatic group that has at least one heteroatom incorporated within the ring of the aromatic group.

The term “aralkyl” as used herein is an aryl group having an alkyl, alkynyl, or alkenyl group as defined above attached to the aromatic group. An example of an aralkyl group is a benzyl group. The term “carbonate group” as used herein is represented by the formula OC(O)OR, where R can be hydrogen, an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, halogenated alkyl, or heterocycloalkyl group described above. The term “organic residue” defines a carbon containing residue, i.e., a residue comprising at least one carbon atom, and includes but is not limited to the carbon-containing groups, residues, or radicals defined hereinabove. Organic residues can contain various heteroatoms, or be bonded to another molecule through a heteroatom, including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or the like. Examples of organic residues include but are not limited alkyl or substituted alkyls, alkoxy or substituted alkoxy, mono or di-substituted amino, amide groups, etc. Organic residues can preferably comprise 1 to 18 carbon atoms, 1 to 15, carbon atoms, 1 to 12 carbon atoms, 1 to 8 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In a further aspect, an organic residue can comprise 2 to 18 carbon atoms, 2 to 15, carbon atoms, 2 to 12 carbon atoms, 2 to 8 carbon atoms, 2 to 4 carbon atoms, or 2 to 4 carbon atoms. A very close synonym of the term “residue” is the term “radical,” which as used in the specification and concluding claims, refers to a fragment, group, or substructure of a molecule described herein, regardless of how the molecule is prepared. For example, a 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl radical in a particular compound has the structure: regardless of whether 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl is used to prepare the compound. In some aspects the radical (for example an alkyl) can be further modified (i.e., substituted alkyl) by having bonded thereto one or more “substituent radicals.” The number of atoms in a given radical is not critical to the present disclosure unless it is indicated to the contrary elsewhere herein. “Organic radicals,” as the term is defined and used herein, contain one or more carbon atoms. An organic radical can have, for example, 1-26 carbon atoms, 1-18 carbon atoms, 1-12 carbon atoms, 1-8 carbon atoms, 1-6 carbon atoms, or 1-4 carbon atoms. In a further aspect, an organic radical can have 2-26 carbon atoms, 2-18 carbon atoms, 2-12 carbon atoms, 2-8 carbon atoms, 2-6 carbon atoms, or 2-4 carbon atoms. Organic radicals often have hydrogen bound to at least some of the carbon atoms of the organic radical. One example, of an organic radical that comprises no inorganic atoms is a 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl radical. In some aspects, an organic radical can contain 1-10 inorganic heteroatoms bound thereto or therein, including halogens, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, and the like.

A few non-limiting examples of organic radicals that include heteroatoms include alkoxy radicals, trifluoromethoxy radicals, acetoxy radicals, dimethylamino radicals and the like. As used herein, the terms “number average molecular weight” or “Mn” can be used interchangeably, and refer to the statistical average molecular weight of all the polymer chains in the sample and is defined by the formula: M n = ∑ N i  M i ∑ N i , where Mi is the molecular weight of a chain and Ni is the number of chains of that molecular weight. Mn can be determined for polymers, e.g., polycarbonate polymers, by methods well known to a person having ordinary skill in the art using molecular weight standards, e.g. polycarbonate standards or polystyrene standards, preferably certified or traceable molecular weight standards P   D   I = M w M n . As used herein, the terms “weight average molecular weight” or “Mw” can be used interchangeably, and are defined by the formula: M n = ∑ N i  M i ∑ N i , where Mi is the molecular weight of a chain and Ni is the number of chains of that molecular weight. Compared to Mn, Mw takes into account the molecular weight of a given chain in determining contributions to the molecular weight average. Thus, the greater the molecular weight of a given chain, the more the chain contributes to the Mw. Mw can be determined for polymers, e.g. polycarbonate polymers, by methods well known to a person having ordinary skill in the art using molecular weight standards, e.g. polycarbonate standards or polystyrene standards, preferably certified or traceable molecular weight standards. As used herein, the terms “polydispersity index” or “PDI” can be used interchangeably, and are defined by the formula: M w = ∑ N i  M i 2 ∑ N i  M i , The PDI has a value equal to or greater than 1, but as the polymer chains approach uniform chain length, the PDI approaches unity. As used herein, “polycarbonate” refers to an oligomer or polymer comprising residues of one or more dihydroxy compounds, e.g., dihydroxy aromatic compounds, joined by carbonate linkages; it also encompasses homopolycarbonates, copolycarbonates, and (co)polyester carbonates. The terms “residues” and “structural units”, used in reference to the constituents of the polymers, are synonymous throughout the specification. As used herein the terms “weight percent,” “wt %,” and “wt. %,” which can be used interchangeably, indicate the percent by weight of a given component based on the total weight of the composition, unless otherwise specified. That is, unless otherwise specified, all wt % values are based on the total weight of the composition. It should be understood that the sum of wt % values for all components in a disclosed composition or formulation are equal to 100. Each of the materials disclosed herein are either commercially available and/or the methods for the production thereof are known to those of skill in the art.

After 1 hr of stirring, another 35 gm of solid KMnO4 was added while maintaining the same temperature. Similarly, a final 35 gm of KMnO4 was added and stirred at 100° C. for 6 hours. After completion, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, then 100 ml of deionized water was added, followed by concentrated HCl until a pH 2-3 was reached. 500 ml of ethyl acetate was added, and the ethyl acetate layer was separated. The aqueous layer was then washed twice with 250 ml ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were combined and washed with four times with 200 ml of deionized water.

The solution was then filtered over celite bed at 50° C., and the clear filtrate was cooled to 25-30° C. (room temp). To the filtrate, 200 ml of ethyl acetate was added and the ethyl acetate layer separated five times, keeping the ethyl acetate layer aside. The aqueous layer was collected separately, and acidified to pH 2-3 using 1 M HCl to yield a solid white precipitate. The white solid (95% purity by HPLC) obtained was filtered, washed five times with 100 ml of deionized, and then dried at 100° C. A dry reaction flask, equipped with mechanical stirrer, condenser & nitrogen inlet was charged with 10 g of the white solid product (95% purity by HPLC). 200 ml of Glacial acetic acid was added, heated to 100° C., and stirred until completely dissolved.
