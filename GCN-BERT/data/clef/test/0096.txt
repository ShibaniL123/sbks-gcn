CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/950,629, filed on Mar. 10, 2014, entitled “Mark Watts—Table—Att,” the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND In many urban and suburban areas, living and working space is a premium. Limited floor space in apartments, homes, shared work spaces, and other living spaces can make it difficult to properly furnish a space for one or more desired purposes. Trade-offs are often required between considerations such as necessary open space, for example due to fire codes, building codes, and/or personal preference, and providing adequate fixtures for enabling use of the space, such as, for example, tables or desks to allow comfortable working, entertaining, and living. Even in environments having limited floor space, wall space is generally available. Wall space can be utilized for decorating an environment, such as, for example, by hanging artwork or other hangings. The selected artwork can reflect the tastes of the owners, the function of the space, and/or may be based on one or more additional aesthetic or functional considerations. It would be desirable to utilize the available wall space in limited floor space environments to serve dual functional and artistic purposes.

The protective covering 12 is configured to protect the artwork from moisture, dust, wear and tear, and/or other harmful environmental factors. In some embodiments, a sealant is applied between the protective covering 12 and the frame 4 to further protect the artwork 10. In some embodiments, the internal surfaces of the frame 4 define longitudinal channels sized and configured to receive the artwork 10 and/or the protective covering 12 therein. The longitudinal channels may define recessed channels formed in the longitudinal members 6a, 6b and/or the cross-members 8a, 8b of the frame 4. In some embodiments, the longitudinal members 6a, 6b and/or the cross-members 8a, 8b define an upper lip surface. The protective covering 12 and/or the artwork 10 are sized and configured to rest on the upper lip surface. The protective covering 12 is sealed to the frame 4 to maintain the protective covering 12 and the artwork 10 in a fixed position with respect to the frame 4. Although the embodiments described herein include separate artwork and frame, it will be understood that in some embodiments, the artwork 10 and the frame 4 may comprise a single unitary piece. In some embodiments, the convertible art table 2 is convertible from a collapsed configuration suitable for hanging on a wall (as shown in FIG. 1) to an expanded configuration that allows the convertible art table 2 to be used as a table (as shown in FIG. 2). The convertible art table 2 comprises one or more legs 14a, 14b rotatably coupled to the frame 4. Each of the legs 14a, 14b includes a plurality of leg members 16, a bottom cross-member 18, and a top cross-member 26 (see FIG. 3). The legs are rotatable from a first, collapsed position to a second, deployed position. To convert the convertible art table 2 to a table, a first leg 14a and a second leg 14b are deployed from the collapsed position to the deployed position. The first leg 14a and the second leg 14b are rotatably coupled to the frame 4, for example, by a hinge, joint, or other rotatable coupling. The first and second legs 14a, 14b are deployed by rotating the legs 14a, 14b about an axis of rotation defined between the top cross-member 26 of each of the legs 14a, 14b and the frame 4 (see FIG. 3). In some embodiments, the first and second legs 14a, 14b are locked after deployment by a locking mechanism.

The locking member 20 comprises a locking clip sized and configured to couple the first and second legs 14a, 14b to the frame 4 when the first and second legs 14a, 14b are in a deployed position. The locking clip comprises a u-shaped clip. In other embodiments, the first and second legs 14a, 14b may be locked to the frame 4 by a locking tab, locking bolt, and/or any other suitable locking mechanism. The locking mechanism may be an external locking mechanism (as illustrated) and/or may comprise an internal locking mechanism. FIG. 3 illustrates a back surface 24 of the convertible art table 2. The frame 4 defines an internal volume 22. The walls of the internal volume 22 are defined by, for example, the longitudinal members 6a, 6b and the cross-members 8a, 8b of the frame 4. In some embodiments, the internal volume 22 comprises a depth at least equal to a thickness of the first and second legs 14a, 14b. When the first and second legs 14a, 14b are in a collapsed position, the first and second legs 14a, 14b sit flush with and/or recessed beneath the frame 4, which allows the convertible art table 2 to hang flush on a wall. In some embodiments, the first and second legs 14a, 14b may be locked in a collapsed position to prevent accidental deployment. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second legs 14a, 14b are locked in the collapsed position by one or more locking members 20. The locking members 20 couple the respective bottom cross-members 18a, 18b of the first and second legs 14a, 14b. The locking members 20 are removed to allow the first and second legs 14a, 14b to transition to a deployed position. After the legs 14a, 14b are transitioned to a deployed position, the locking members 20 may be used to lock the legs 14a, 14b in a deployed position. FIG. 4 illustrates the back surface 24 of the convertible art table 2 with first and second legs 14a, 14b in a deployed position. The top cross-member 26 of each of the first and second legs 14a, 14b rotates within the inner volume 22, such that the top cross-member 26 remains flush with the frame 4 in a deployed position. In some embodiments, the top cross-member 26 of each of the first and second legs 14a, 14b is rotatably coupled to respective cross-members 8a, 8b of the frame 4. In some embodiments, the first and second legs 14a, 14b are locked and/or fixed to the frame 4 when in a deployed position. The first and second legs 14a, 14b may be locked to the frame 4 by, for example, locking members 20. The locking members 20 couple the upper cross-member 26 of each of the first and second legs 14a, 14b to respective frame cross-members 8a, 8b. In operation, the locking members 20 are removed from the bottom cross-members 18a, 18b of the first and second legs 14a, 14b. The first and second legs 14a, 14b are transitioned to a deployed position (as shown in FIG. 4). The locking members 20 are coupled to the upper cross-members 26 and frame cross-members 8a, 8b to lock the legs 14a, 14b in the deployed position. In some embodiments, the convertible art table 2 comprises changeable artwork 10. For example, in some embodiments, one or more pieces of the frame 4, such as, for example, a first cross-member 8a, are removable (see FIGS. 5 & 6). The removable cross-member 8a is separated from the first and second longitudinal members 6a, 6b. Once the removable cross-member 8a is removed, the artwork 10 may be removed from the frame 4 and replaced with an second piece. In some embodiments, a hard backing 28 remains in the frame 4 after the artwork 10 is removed. In some embodiments, the backing 28 is removable. The removable cross-member 8a may be coupled to the longitudinal members 6a, 6b by one or more projections that form a friction coupling within an internal channel defined by the longitudinal members 6a, 6b. In some embodiments, one or more fasteners may be used to couple the removable cross-member 8a to the longitudinal members 6a, 6b. The one or more fasteners may comprise any suitable fastener, such as, for example, a screw, bolt, detent pins, and/or any other removable fastener. In some embodiments, the removable artwork 10 and/or the removable backing 28 are disposed within longitudinal slots defined by the inner surface of the frame 4. For example, one embodiment, the longitudinal members 6a, 6b and the cross-members 8a, 8b define longitudinal slots formed therein. The longitudinal slots are sized and configured to receive the artwork 10, the protective cover 12, and/or the backing 28. In some embodiments, the longitudinal slots are sized and configured to receive multiple pieces of artwork 10, to provide for simple interchanging of artwork 10. For example, in one embodiment, two or more pieces of artwork 10, such as, for example, art pieces, photos, game table art, game boards, and/or any other suitable artwork are stored in the frame 4. The removable cross-member 8a can be removed from the frame 4 and the pieces of artwork 10 stored within the frame can be rearranged such that a new piece of artwork 10 is displayed by the frame 4. For example, in some embodiments, up to five or more art pieces, photos, game tables, game boards, etc., are stored in the frame 4. In operation, the convertible art table 2 is configured to be stored and displayed on a wall as an art piece (see FIG. 1). The convertible art table 2 can be removed from the wall and converted into a table (see FIG. 2) as needed. For example, in small apartments, dorm rooms, and/or other living areas with limited space, the convertible art table 2 can be displayed on the wall as artwork when not in use, saving floor space. When a table is required, for example, as a working space, for entertaining, as a play area for children, etc., the convertible art table 2 is removed from the wall, converted into a table, and can be used as a table for any duration. The convertible art table 2 can be converted back into the collapsed position and placed back onto a wall when no longer needed. In some embodiments, at least one of the longitudinal members 6a, 6b and/or the cross-members 8a, 8b of the frame 4 define a wall hanging feature 30. The wall hanging feature 30 may comprise any suitable wall hanging device. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the wall hanging feature 30 comprises a hole formed in the first longitudinal member 6a. A fastener, such as, for example, a screw, is coupled to a wall. The fastener is configured to interface with the wall hanging feature 30. In other embodiments, the wall hanging feature 30 may comprise any other suitable wall hanging device, such as, for example, a wire, a hook, etc. Although the illustrated embodiments include a wall hanging feature 30 formed in the first longitudinal member 6a, it will be appreciated that the wall hanging feature 30 may be formed in any suitable portion of the convertible art table 2, such as, for example, the first or second longitudinal members 6a, 6b, the first or second cross-members 8a, 8b, the backing 28, and/or any other suitable portion of the convertible art table 2. In some embodiments, multiple wall hanging features 30 may be formed in the convertible art table 2 to allow the convertible art table 2 to be hung in a plurality of orientations. FIGS. 7-9 illustrate an additional embodiment of a convertible art table 102 having a variable height. The convertible art table 102 is similar to the convertible art table 2 discussed in conjunction with FIGS. 1-6, and similar description is not repeated herein.
