ANTI-HUMAN VEGF ANTIBODIES WITH UNUSUALLY STRONG BINDING AFINITY TO HUMAN VEGF-A AND CROSS REACTIVITY TO HUMAN VEGF- B BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the invention This invention relates generally to anti-human VEGF antibodies with unusually high binding affinity for human VEGF-A and which also cross react with human VEGF-B and particularly to chimeric and humanized versions these antibodies. Description of related art Angiogenesis is a physiological process that involves the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. This process is vital for growth and development as well as for wound healing. However, it is also fundamental for malignant tumor development and for other non-tumor associated pathologies such as proliferative retinopathies, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis (Folkman J. 1971; Praidou A et al.2010; Canavese M et al. 2010). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a protein secreted by stromal and tumor cells and in a minor proportion by a variety of other cells that plays a key role in stimulation of Angiogenesis (Ferrara N et al. 2004). Over-expression of VEGF can contribute to angiogenesis related diseases. For example, solid cancers cannot grow beyond a limited size without an adequate blood supply and cancers that express VEGF are more capable of growing and metastasizing (Ferrara N. 2005). Taking into account these considerations, anti-angiogenic therapies were developed using anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies such as Bevacizumab (Avastin) for cancer treatment (Ferrara N et al. 2005) and Ranibizumab (Lucentis) for retinopathy (Ciulla TA et al. 2009). Therapies based in the use of Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab have been extensively studied and applied during the last few years (Van Meter ME et al. 2010; Ciulla TA et al. 2009). Bevacizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for metastatic renal carcinoma, glioblastoma, metastatic colon cancer and non- small cell lung cancer in combination with standard chemotherapy and for use in metastatic breast cancer. However, in the US, a FDA panel of experts has now said they do not see enough of a benefit from Avastin in advanced breast cancer to justify its serious risks. Several clinical trials are also currently in progress in non-metastatic breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer, castrate-resistant prostate cancer, non-metastatic unresectable liver cancer and metastatic or unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Bevacizumab is also used without FDA approval, but on the basis of clinical studies, for treatment of macular degeneration, an eye disease also characterized by proliferation of blood vessels in the retina. Ranibizumab is a Fab antibody fragment derived from the same murine antibody as Bevacizumab and has been approved by the FDA to treat the wet age-related macular degeneration. In spite of the benefits resulting of the clinical use of the currently approved anti- VEGF-A antibodies, numerous problems remain to be solved regarding to therapeutic effects, side effects, resistance to treatment and cost of treatments. Therefore, development of new more effective anti-human VEGF antibodies is necessary. We have now developed new anti-human VEGF antibodies witch surprisingly have unusually high binding affinity for the human VEGF-A target and cross-reactivity with human VEGF-B. Even thought VEGF-B is strongly related to VEGF-A according to its amino acid sequence, rather than an angiogenic function has a potent survival/antiapoptotic effect required for blood vessel survival (Li X et al.2009). Therefore, VEGF-B is very important to maintain integrity of the blood vessels which support tumor growth and interference in its action should contribute to a more complete anti-tumor therapy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION -This application describes anti-human VEGF antibodies with unusually strong binding affinity for human VEGF-A and cross reactivity with human VEGF-B, which are stronger inhibitors of the VEGF induced proliferation of endothelial cells in culture as compared with anti-human VEGF antibodies in the art. -The murine anti-human VEGF antibodies disclosed herein binds human VEGF-A with a e of no more than 5 x 10 -12 KD valu M and one humanized version of anti-human VEGF disclose herein binds human VEGF-A with a KD value of no more than 1.0 x 10"10 M. Furthermore, the mouse anti-human VEGF antibodies disclosed herein have an IC50 value of about 11 ng/ml for inhibiting VEGF-A induced proliferation of HUVEC endothelial cells in vitro and its humanized version have an IC50 value of about 19 ng/ml for inhibiting VEGF-A induced proliferation of HUVEC endothelial cells in vitro. The anti-human VEGF antibodies of the present invention bind to three regions of human VEGF-A 165 (SEQ ID NO: l) encompassing amino acids residues 16 to 25, 45 to 54 and 79 to 92 of the human VEGF-A165 (SEQ ID NO: l). All of these regions are involved in the interaction between VEGF-A and its receptor (VEGFR). In particular amino-acids 16 to 25 of the VEGF-A165 are involved in an important contact region (Shalini L et al.2010). Regarding to this, it has been pointed out that monoclonal antibodies against this region may be very difficult to obtain by the traditional method used to obtain monoclonal antibodies against human VEGF (Jin Kim K et al. 1993) because of the high homology between human and mouse VEGF in the segment comprising amino-acids 16 to 25 (Fuh G et al.2006). However, a modification in the scheme of immunization disclosed in this invention surprisingly resulted in the obtainment of monoclonal antibodies against this region using the classical method (Kohler et al.1975). These monoclonal antibodies have unusual high affinity to the VEGF-A molecule and also present cross reactivity with human VEGF-B (SEQ ID NO: 2). - Within the scope of this invention is the use of the humanized version of the antibodies here disclosed for treating VEGF -related angiogenic diseases, including cancer, age- related macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetic retinopathy, by administering to a subject in need of the treatment a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following description of the invention merely intends illustrate several embodiments of the invention. However, by not means these discussed embodiments limit the scope of the invention since many changes and modifications will be apparent to one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. ABREVIATIONS The following abbreviations are used throughout the present invention: VEGF= vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-A= vascular endothelial growth factor variant A; VEGF-B= vascular endothelial growth factor variant B; VEGFR= vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; HUVEC = Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; KD = dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction; BSA = Bovine serum albumin. DEFINITIONS The term "human VEGF" as used herein refers to the 165-amino acid vascular cell growth factor (VEGF-A165) (SEQ ID NO: l), and described related vascular endothelial growth factors (Leung DW et al 1989, Houck, KA et al 1991) and allelic and processed forms of those growth factors as described (Ferrara N. 1999). The term "human VEGF-B" as used herein refers to the 186-amino acid vascular cells growth factor variant (VEGF-B186) (SEQ ID NO:2) which has a critical role in blood vessel survival during pathological conditions (Zhang F et al. 2009). The term "antibody" as used herein includes any of the following molecular species: monoclonal antibody, polyclonal antibody, multispecific antibody, or bispecific antibody. A normal antibody comprises two heavy chains and two light chains. Each heavy chain consist of a variable region and a constant region. Each heavy chain has two regions, the constant region and the variable region. Each light chain has also a constant region and a variable region. The variable regions of the light and heavy chains are responsible for antigen binding. The variable region in both chains generally contains three variable loops named complementary determining regions (CDRs). The three CDRs are inserted between flanking segments named framework region (FRs). The FRs is significantly more conserved than CDRs. Antibodies are grouped into different isotypes based on the structure of their heavy chain. There are five major isotypes of antibodies named IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. The term "antigen-binding fragment" as used herein refers to an antibody fragment the binds to a given antigen but do not comprise a complete antibody. Some, but not all, well known in the art examples of antigen-binding fragments are: Fab, F(ab')2, Fv, and scFv. In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding fragment may comprise one or more CDRs from a specific antibody combined with FRs of one or more human antibodies. "Fab" refers to an antibody fragment that binds to antigens and it is composed of one constant and one variable domain of each of the heavy and the light chain. In an experimental setting, Fab fragments can be generated by digestion of an antibody with the enzyme papain. "F(ab')2" refers to an antibody fragment that can be obtained by digestion of an antibody with the enzyme pepsin that cleaves below the hinge antibody region. "Fv" refers to the smallest fragment of an antibody to bear the complete antigen binding site and that consist of the variable region of the light chain bound to the variable region of the heavy chain of the same antibody. "scFv" refers to an engineering molecule consisting of two Fv fragments connected by a peptide linker (Huston, J. S. et al.1988). The term "epitope" as used herein refers to a special region of an antigen were an antibody binds. The term "Cancer" as used herein refers to a medical condition involving uncontrollably cell division that results in formation of malignant tumors and metastasis. The term "angiogenesis" as used herein refers to a physiological process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. The phrase "disease associated with excessive angiogenesis" as used herein refers to a medical condition caused by an abnormal increase in angiogenesis. Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies with High Affinity for its Target Antigen Monoclonal antibodies affinity for its target antigen is a critical factor to be taken into account for therapeutic performance (Harms BD et al 2012; Lippow MS et al 2007; Zhou Y, et al 2012). Antibodies of higher affinity may be able to be used at lower doses to achieve the desired clinical effects. Lower dosing may allow for more convenient routes of administration and decreased injection volumes, which would translate into lower cost of goods. Antibodies reported to be of high affinity are generally in the nanomolar range (Griffiths AD, et al 1994; de Haard HJ, et al 1999) and occasionally in the sub-nanomolar range (Vaughan TJ et al 1996). In particular, the KD of the well known anti-VEGF therapeutic monoclonal antibody AVASTIN™ (bevacisumab) is in the nanomolar range (Presta, L. G., et al 1997). There are few reports describing monoclonal antibodies with a KD in the picomolar range and all of them were obtained using non-conventional techniques (Yang W et al 1995; Rathanaswami P et al 2005; Zhao Q et al 2011 ; Pichinuk E et al 2012). The present invention provides anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies which bind human VEGF-Aies (SEQ ID NO: 1) with a KD value of about 5.0 pM in its mouse version, and a KD of about 100 pM in one humanized version. - Both, the mouse anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody and the humanized version of this invention also have cross-reactivity with human VEGF-B (SEQ ID NO: 2). - The murine version of the monoclonal antibodies of this invention neutralizes VEGF-A in the HUVEC proliferation assay with an IC50 of about 11 ng/ml (five times lower than the IC50 of bevacizumab in the same assay), and the humanized version of the antibodies of this invention in a concentration of about 19 ng/ml (three times lower that the IC50 of bevacizumab in the same assay). - Both, the mouse anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody and the humanized version of this invention have been characterized as possessing superior anti-tumor activity in vivo than Bevacizumab. This is not at all an obvious result since numerous factors determine the anti-tumor activity in vivo (Rudnick SI et al 2009; Beckman RA et al 2007; Covell DG et al 1986; Thurber GM et al 2007; Jain RK et al 1990; Liang W et al 2006). Therefore, the discovery of an antibody with very high affinity and simultaneously very high biological activity in vivo such as the one disclosed herein is highly unpredictable . Disclosed herein are the parental mice antibody named mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A (mouse monoclonal antibody A-AB1 -anti- VEGF-A), the cell line (hybridoma) that produces it named mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A clone, a humanized version of mMcA-ABl- anti- VEGF-A named hMcA-ABl -VEGF-A (humanized monoclonal antibody A-ABl-anti- VEGF-A) and an engineered mini- version of mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A. As discussed below, the parental antibody mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A was obtained using in general the Kohler's method (Kohler G et al 1975) but employing an unusual immunization scheme as described in EXAMPLE 1. In order to select cell clones producing anti-human VEGF-A antibodies of high biological efficiency, the HUVEC proliferation assay was used (for technical description of this assay see EXAMPLE 5). The cell clone (hybridoma) producing the most active antibody was the above mention mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A clone. To our surprise, the monoclonal antibody produced by this cell clone has a very unusual high affinity (KD in the pM range) for the human VEGF-Ai65 (SEQ ID NO: 1) angiogenic factor as measured using the biacore T100 sensor (for technical description of this assay see EXAMPLE 2). Amino acid sequences of the heavy and light variable chains of mMc A- AB1 -anti- VEGF-A are: Variable Heavy Chain: OVKLLESGPELKKPGETVKISCKASGYTFTNFGMNWVKOAPGKGLKWMGWINTN TGEPTYVDDFKGRFAFSLETSASSAYLQISNLNNEDTATYFCARYYGSTSVWYFDV WGAGTTVTVSS (SEQ ID NO: 3) Variable Light Chain: ELVMTOTPSSLSASLGDRVTITCRASODIFNYLNWYOOKPDGPIKLLIYYSSRLHSG VPSRFSGSGSGTDYSLTISNLDREDIATYFCOOGFTLPWTFGGGTKLEIKR (SEQ ID NO: 4) CDR regions are underlined (For technical description of sequencing see EXAMPLE 6) Epitope analysis indicated that mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A bind the following three segments of the VEGF-A165 (SEQ ID NO: 1) amino acid sequence: 1: HHEVVKFMDVYQRSYCH (aa 11 to 27 of VEGF-A165) 2: YIFKPSCVPLMR (aa 44 to 56 of VEGF-Ai65) 3: QIMRIKPHQGQHIG (aa 79 to 92 of VEGF-Ai65) (For technical description of epitope mapping see EXAMPLE 3) Underlined are amino acids described as critical for binding of VEGF-A to its receptor VEGFR-2 (Kiba A et al, 2003). According to this, mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A is the only described monoclonal antibody able to block all the three points of close interaction between VEGF-A and its receptor VEGFR-2. This may explain at least partially the high efficiency of mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A to inhibit VEGF-A activity in biological assays as compared with anti-VEGF antibodies known in the art. For example, mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A exhibited the ability to inhibit HUVEC proliferation to a greater extent than Bevacizumab (see EXAMPLE 5). Also, in inhibition of tumor growth the antibodies of this invention demonstrated to be more effective at the assayed doses than Bevacizumab (see EXAMPLE 10). It is worth mention that all the assayed antibodies lack significant neutralizing activity to mouse VEGF (see EXAMPLE 1) a fact that renders comparison between its anti-tumor activities meaningful. Other anti-VEGF antibodies having neutralizing activity against mouse- VEGF have been compared, regarding to its efficiency to inhibit human tumor growth in nude mice, with Bevacizumab which do not cross-react with mouse-VEGF-A (see US patent 8,101,177 and US patent 8,034,905). Therefore, these studies are not adequate to predict the relative efficiency of these antibodies as compared with Bevacizumab in humans. Regarding to this, an illustrative discussion about the contribution of the stromal mouse VEGF to growth of human tumor xenografts can be found in Liang et al (Liang, W.C., et al., "Cross-Species Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-Blocking Antibodies Completely Inhibit the Growth of Human Tumor Xenografts and Measure the Contribution of Stromal VEGF," J. Biol. Chem. 281(2):951-961 (2006)). As discussed above, this good performance of mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A in the anti-tumor assay in vivo was not at all obvious because high affinity (or even high inhibition of the activity of VEGF-A in the in vitro UVEC assay) do not necessary correlate with a high increase in the anti-tumor activity in vivo where many other factors may influence activity. As described below (EXAMPLE 7), a superhumanized version of the parental antibody mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A was obtained. For this, the framework regions between CDRs of mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A were replaced for the most homologous framework regions obtained from IgG genes of human germinal cell lines (Tan P et al. 2002). This methodology introduces minimal mouse amino acid residues in order to avoid immunological reactivity during treatment of humans. (For technical description of the superhumanization processes see EXAMPLE 7). The sequences of the Variable Heavy and Variable Light chains of the superhumanized version of mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A, named hMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A are: Variable Heavy: OVOLVOSGSELKKPGASVKVSCKASGYTFTNFGMNWVROAPGOGLEWMGWINT NTGEPTYVDDFKGRFVFSLDTSVSTAYLQISSLKAEDTAVYYCARYYGSTSVWYF DVWGRGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO: 5) Variable Light: DIOMTOSPSSLSASVGDRVTITCRASODIFNYLNWYOOKPGKAPKLLIYYSSRLHS GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTFTISSLOPEDIATYYCOOGFTLPWTFGOGTKVEIKR (SEQ ID NO: 6) CDR regions are underlined As its parent antibody, hMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A exhibited the ability to inhibit HUVEC proliferation to a greater extent than Bevacizumab (see EXAMPLE 9). Also, as its parent antibody, hMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A exhibited the ability to inhibit tumor- growth in vivo to a greater extent than Bevacizumab (see EXAMPLE 10 ). Provided herein in certain embodiments are antibodies and antigen binding fragments that comprise the CDR sequences (SEQ ID NO: 7-12) of niMcA-ABl-anti- VEGF-A as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5-6. In certain embodiments, the antibodies provided herein bind VEGF-A165 (SEQ ID NO: l) with greater affinity than that of Bevacizumab for VEGF-A165. For example, in certain embodiments, the antibodies provided herein bind VEGF-A165 with a KD of about 100 pM and in other embodiments with a KD of about 5 pM. The antibodies provided herein have been found to inhibit HUVEC proliferation with greater efficiency than Bevacizumab. For example in certain embodiments, the antibodies herein provided inhibit HUVEC proliferation with an ID50 of about 19 ng/ml and in another embodiments with an ID50 of about 11 ng/ml. Therefore, the antibodies provided herein may be used to treat various medical conditions associated with increased angiogenesis. For example, the antibodies may be used to treat cancer by inhibiting the proliferation of blood vessels that irrigate a tumor and therefore inhibiting the tumor growth. The anti-tumor efficiency of the antibodies herein provided has been confirmed in vivo (Example 10). In certain embodiments, the antibodies provided herein inhibit tumor growth at a greater level than Bevacizumab. In in vivo experiments using a xenotransplanted murine tumor model, mMcA-AB 1-anti-VEGF-A and hMcA-AB 1-anti-VEGF-A inhibited tumor growth with more efficiency than Bevacizumab. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the antibodies provided herein may be used at similar dosage that Bevacizumab to achieve a better antitumor effect or at lesser dosage to avoid secondary undesirable side effects with similar effectivity. The antibodies disclosed herein may be used in the treatment of medical conditions caused by excessive angiogenesis caused by excessive expression of VEGF. Examples of these conditions include wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy as ocular diseases and several tumoral diseases (Crawford TN et al, 2009; Albini A et al, 2012).

The term "therapeutically effective amount" or "effective dosage" as used herein refers to the dosage or concentration of a drug effective to treat a disease or condition. For example, with regard to the use of the antibodies disclosed herein to treat cancer, a therapeutically effective amount is the dosage or concentration of the antibody or antigen- binding fragment capable of eradicating all or part of a tumor, inhibiting or slowing tumor growth, inhibiting growth or proliferation of cells mediating a cancerous condition, inhibiting tumor cell metastasis, ameliorating any symptom or marker associated with a tumor or cancerous condition, preventing or delaying the development of a tumor or cancerous condition, or some combination thereof. The effective dosage of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment provided herein may be determined using methods well known in the art. For example, the effective dosage may be established by determining whether a tumor being treated in a subject shrinks, ceases to grow, or grows more slowly following administration at a particular dosage. In certain embodiments, an antibody as provided herein may be administered at a therapeutically effective dosage of about 0.01 μg/mouse to about 100 μg/mouse. A given dosage may be administered at various intervals, such as for example once a day, two or more times per day, two or more times per week, once per week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once a month, or once every two or more months. In certain embodiments, the administration dosage may change over the course of treatment. For example, in certain embodiments the initial administration dosage may be higher than subsequent administration dosages. In certain embodiments, the administration dosage may vary over the course of treatment depending on the reaction of the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single dose may be administered, or several divided doses may be administered over time. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the antibodies disclosed herein, and in certain embodiments in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, may be prepared by methods well known in the art. The antibodies and antigen-binding fragments disclosed herein may be administered by any route known in the art, such as for example parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intravenous, including intravenous infusion, intramuscular, or intradermal injection) or non-parenteral (e.g., oral, intranasal, intraocular, sublingual, rectal, or topical) routes. In embodiments wherein the antibodies are administered via injection, injectable pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared in any conventional form, such as for example liquid solution, suspension, emulsion, or solid forms suitable for generating liquid solution, suspension, or emulsion. Preparations for injection may include sterile solutions ready for injection, sterile dry soluble products, such as lyophilized powders, ready to be combined with a solvent just prior to use, including hypodermic tablets, sterile suspensions ready for injection, sterile dry insoluble products ready to be combined with a vehicle just prior to use, and sterile emulsions. The solutions may be either aqueous or nonaqueous. In certain embodiments, a sterile, lyophilized powder is prepared by dissolving an antibody or antigen-binding fragment as disclosed herein in a suitable solvent. The solvent may contain an excipient which improves the stability or other pharmacological components of the powder or reconstituted solution, prepared from the powder. Excipients that may be used include, but are not limited to, water, dextrose, sorbital, fructose, corn syrup, xylitol, glycerin, glucose, sucrose or other suitable agent.

The mouse antibody mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A of this invention can be produced by culturing the cell clone (hybridoma) producing mMcA- AB1 -anti-VEGF- A, in vitro or in vivo, using standard techniques well known in the art (See for example Birch JR et al 1985). Alternatively, an expression system can be used. DNA encoding the parental mouse monoclonal antibody of this invention, can be isolated from the producer cells or synthesized in vitro, inserted in a cloning vector and introduced into a suitable host cell or bacteria using standard procedures (Davies SL. 2009, Volume 6, 153-173). Non- natural versions of the mouse parental antibody disclosed herein (e.g. chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, or single chain antibodies) can be prepared using methods well known in the art (Morrison SL et al 1984; Neuberger MS et al 1984; Takeda S et al 1985). Expression systems can be also used to produce the different antibody derivatives of the mouse parental monoclonal antibody disclosed herein. These expression systems include polynucleotides encoding the antibodies, vectors comprising these polynucleotides, and host cells comprising these vectors. Polynucleotides encoding the antibodies disclosed herein may be isolated or synthesized using methods well known in the art, and inserted into a replicable vector for amplification or cloneing. Polynucleotides encoding variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) chains of the antibodies may be expressed from a single vector, or they may be expressed using two separate vectors, followed by in vitro assembly. In certain embodiments, they may be co- expressed from two separate vectors within the same cell and assembled intracellularly. Suitable vectors may contain various configurations of one or more regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, or transcription initiation sequences, as well as genes encoding markers for phenotypic selection. Vectors having suitable backbones for expression of the antibodies disclosed herein are known in the art (See for example Davies SL et al, 2009). In certain embodiments, the vector may contain a polynucleotide sequence encoding the constant regions of the heavy chain (CH) and light chain (CL) of a human IgG immunoglobulin. Alternatively, the vector may express only the VH and VL chains of the antibody, with the expressed polypeptide comprising an Fv fragment rather than a whole antibody. Vectors may be inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification or expression of the polynucleotide sequence. The host cells may be cultured for antibody production in a variety of media known in the art, such as for example Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Sigma), and Ham's F10 (Sigma). Media may be supplemented with a variety of agents, such as for example hormones, growth factors, salts, buffers, nucleotides, antibiotics, trace elements, glucose, or other energy sources. Culture conditions such as temperature and pH may be adjusted using parameters well known in the art. Following expression, one or more antibodies as provided herein may be purified using methods well known in the art (See for example Vijayalakshmi MA. 1998). The antibodies disclosed herein may comprise conjugates for specific delivery to the tumor location. The following examples are provided to better illustrate the claimed invention and are not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention. All specific compositions, materials, and methods described below, in whole or in part, fall within the scope of the present invention. These specific compositions, materials, and methods are not intended to limit the invention, but merely to illustrate specific embodiments falling within the scope of the invention. One skilled in the art may develop equivalent compositions, materials, and methods without the exercise of inventive capacity and without departing from the scope of the invention. It will be understood that many variations can be made in the procedures herein described while still remaining within the bounds of the present invention. It is the intention of the inventors that such variations are included within the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1: Generation of Anti-VEGF Monoclonal Antibody: Monoclonal antibodies were generated in general according to Kohler' s method (Kohler G et al 1975). However, the immunization scheme was unusual. In brief 4 week- old BALB/c female mice were injected once a month for a period of 10 months with human recombinant VEGF165 (SEQ ID NO: l) conjugated with cationized BSA (Imject® BSA and EDC Conjugation Kits, Pierce, France) in aluminum hydroxide solution (Imject® Alu, Pierce). Lymphocytes were harvested and fused with myeloma cells by treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG 1500, BDH). After this, hybridoma cells were seeded and grown in HAT medium (hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine, Sigma). The presence of specific antibodies was detected by direct ELISA against VEGF-A without BSA. A limited dilution method was used to select anti-human VEGF antibody producing clones. Afterward, in order to select cell clones producing anti-human VEGF-A antibodies of very high affinity, the HUVEC proliferation assay was used. Using this methodology, several candidate hibridomas were isolated and frozen. One of them, named mMcA-AB l-anti-VEGF-A clone was further studied. Monoclonal antibody produced by this mMcA-AB l-anti-VEGF-A hibridoma was named mMcA-AB l- anti- VEGF-A (in short mouse AB 1 antibody). Purification of this antibody was performed by standard techniques (Vijayalakshmi MA. 1998) including affinity chromatography using a protein-G Sepharose column (HiTrap Protein GHP. GE Healthcare). The mouse AB1 antibody of this invention and its derivatives do not cross-react or neutralize mouse VEGF-A as measured by ELISA and Surface Plasmon Resonance. EXAMPLE 2: Determination of the dissociation rate constant (KD) of the complex mMc-ABl-anti- VEGF-A/ VEGF-Ai65 The affinity between the purified mouse monoclonal antibody niMc-AB l-anti- VEGF-A of this invention and VEGF-A165 (SEQ ID NO: 1) protein was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Affinity and Dissociation Constants of the complex mMc-ABl-anti-VEGF-A/ VEGF-A165, KA and KD, respectively, were determined by kinetic analysis fitting a 1: 1 interaction model using the Biacore T100 evaluation software. Results are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Kinetic parameters of the interaction mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A/VEGF-Ai65 ka (1/Ms) kd ( 1/s) KD (1/M) KA (M) 1.87 + 0.02 x 10v 9.9 + 0.4 x 10"s 5.3 x 10"12 1.9 x 1011 This result indicates that the mMc-ABl-anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody of this invention have an unusually high (in the pM range) affinity for human VEGF-A. EXAMPLE 3: Mapping of VEGF-Ai65 epitopes recognized by mMc-ABl-anti-VEGF- A Mapping of VEGF-A165 epitopes recognized by mMc-ABl -anti- VEGF-A was performed by LC Sciences (Huston, Texas) using its PeptArray™ system. Overlapping peptides were synthesized according to the VEGF165 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1). Conditions were: Binding buffer: IX PBS, pH 7.0; Washing buffer: IX PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.0. Binding condition was: 1 μg/mL mMc-ABl- anti- VEGF-A in binding buffer at 25 °C , 1 hour. Detection condition was: 10 ng/mL goat anti-mouse IgG Cy5 conjugate in binding buffer at 25 °C , 30 min. Scanning was at PMT 700 in a 635 nm channel. Results of this analysis indicated main contact of mMc-ABl- anti- VEGF-A with three VEGF-A165 (SEQ ID NO: 1) domains: 1: HHEVVKFMDVYQRSYCH (aa 11 to 27 of VEGF-A165) 2: YIFKPSCVPLMR (aa 44 to 56 of VEGF-Ai65) 3: QIMRIKPHQGQHIG (aa 79 to 92 of VEGF-Ai65) Underlined are amino acids described as critical for binding of VEGF-A to its receptor VEGFR-2 (Kiba A et al 2003). EXAMPLE 4: Cross-reactivity of mMcA-ABl-anti- VEGF-A with human VEGF-Bi86 (SEQ ID NO: 2) mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A (6.30-0.18 μΜ) was injected over immobilized Vascular endothelial growth factor antigen B (VEGF-Bi86) (4000 RU). KA and KD respectively, were determined by kinetic analysis fitting a 1: 1 interaction model using biacore T100 Evaluation software. Kinetic parameters and constants are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Kinetic parameters of the interaction between mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A and VEGF-B186. This result indicates that mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A is able to cross-react with VEGF-Bi86 albeit with low affinity as compared with its affinity for VEGF-A. EXAMPLE 5: Neutralization activity of mMcA-ABl-anti- VEGF-A on the VEGF-A induced proliferation of HUVEC in culture. HUVEC cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 2500 cells/well containing 50 ul of Ml 99 media supplemented with 10% FCS and 50 ug/ml gentamicin. After 2 h, 100 ul of a solution containing 25 ul of purified mMcA-ABl -anti- VEGF-A in RPMI media and 75 ul of Ml 99 complete media containing VEGF (20 ng/ml) were added to each well. After 24 h incubation 25 ul of Ml 99 complete media containing 2,5 μθ/ητΐ methyH H]-thymidine was added and incubation continued for additional 48 h. After this, 50 ul of 6 M guanidinium chloride was added to stop the reaction. Cellular brakeage was completed with three frozen-thaw cycles, DNA was collected in Whatman-GFC filters and radioactivity measured. Fig 1 shows a plot comparing the neutralization capacity of the mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody of this invention and the neutralization capacity of the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab in the art (Zondor SD et al 2004). EXAMPLE 6: Variable Heavy and Variable Light chains sequences of mMcA-ABl- anti-VEGF-A To obtain the sequence of the genes codifying the variable heavy and light chains of mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A, total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells producing the antibody by the TRIzol (Gibco) method. The cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (Promega) with random primers (In vitro gen). Amplification of the variable heavy and light chains of the Fab region was carried out as described (Sastry L. 1989). Primers used for amplification of the variable heavy chain ( 5' end): CPV 1. 5'-AGGT(C/G)(C/A)A(G/A)CT(G/T)CTCGAGTC(T/A)GG-3' CPV 2. 5 '- AGGTCC AGCTGCTCG AGTCTGG- 3 ' CPV 3. 5 '- AGGTCC AGCTGCTCG AGTCAGG- 3 ' CPV 4. 5'-AGGTCCAGCTTCTCGAGTCTGG-3' CPV 5. 5 '-AGGTCC AGCTTCTCG AGTCAGG- 3 ' CPV 6. 5 '-AGGTCC A ACTGCTCG AGTCTGG- 3 ' CPV 7. 5 '-AGGTCC A ACTGCTCG AGTCAGG- 3 ' CPV 8. 5'-AGGTCCAACTTCTCGAGTCTGG-3' CPV 9. 5 '-AGGTCC A ACTTCTCG AGTCAGG- 3 ' CPV 10. 5 '-AGGTCG A ACTTCTCG AGTC (T/A)GG- 3 ' Primer used for amplification of the variable heavy chain ( 3' end): :5 '-AGGCTTTACTAGTACAATCCCTGGGCACAATT-3 ' Primers used for amplification of the variable light chain ( 5' end): CLV 1. 5'-CCAGTTCCGAGCTCGTGCTCACCCAGTCTCCA-3' CLV 2. 5 '-CCAGTTCCGAGCTCCAGATGACCCAGTCTCCA-3 ' CLV 3. 5 '-CCAGATGTGAGCTCGTGATGACCCAGACTCCA-3 ' CLV 4. 5 '-CCAGATGTGAGCTCGTCATGACCCAGTCTCCA-3 ' CLV 5. 5 '-CCAGTTCCGAGCTCGTGATGACACAGTCTCCA-3 ' Primer used for amplification of the variable heavy chain ( 3' end): 5 '-GCGCCGTCTAGAATTAACACTCATTCCTGTTGAA-3 ' The resulting products were cloned into the pComb 3 vector (Barbas, C.F. 1991) and sequenced.

This methodology introduces minimal mouse amino acid residues in order to avoid immunological reactivity during treatment of humans. For homology studies the used data base was IMGT (www.imgt.org). Designed genes containing codifying CDRs of mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A and framework regions of IgG genes of human germinal cell lines as well as a secretion signal were synthesized by a commercial synthesis service (GenScript Corporation, www.genscript.com). The synthetic gene corresponding to the humanized variable heavy region was inserted into the EcoRI and Nhel sites of the pFUSE-CHIg-hGl vector (InvivoGen) and the synthetic gene corresponding to the humanized variable light region was inserted into the BtsEII and BsiWI sites of the pFUSE2-CLIg-hk vector (InvivoGen). Both vectors provide the human constant regions necessary to complete the heavy (pFUSE-CHIg-hGl) and the light (pFUSE2-CLIg-hk) human IgG chains in order to obtain the humanized antibody. Furthermore, plasmids pFUSE-CHIg-hGl-P and pFUSE2-CLIg-hk-P were cotransfected into NSO cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cell clones expressing anti-VEGF antibody activity were selected and one of them used for antibody production and purification using methods well known in the art. The Variable Heavy and Variable Light chains sequences of the humanized version of mMcA-ABl -anti-VEGF- A are as follows: Variable Heavy: OVOLVOSGSELKKPGASVKVSCKASGYTFTNFGMNWVROAPGOGLEWMGWINT NTGEPTYVDDFKGRFVFSLDTSVSTAYLQISSLKAEDTAVYYCARYYGSTSVWYF DVWGRGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO: 5) Variable Light: DIOMTOSPSSLSASVGDRVTITCRASODIFNYLNWYOOKPGKAPKLLIYYSSRLHS GVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTFTISSLOPEDIATYYCOOGFTLPWTFGOGTKVEIKR (SEQ ID NO: 6) Note: CDR regions are underlined EXAMPLE 8: Determination of the dissociation rate constant (KD) of the complex humanized version of mMc-ABl-anti-VEGF-A/ VEGF-A165 The affinity between the humanized version of mMcA-ABl-anti-VEGF-A and VEGF- Ai65 (SEQ ID NO: 1) was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Affinity and Dissociation Constants, KA and KD, respectively, were determined by kinetic analysis fitting a 1: 1 interaction model using the BIAcore T100 evaluation software. Results are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

HUVEC cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 2500 cells/well containing 50 ul of Ml 99 media with addition of 10% FCS and 50 ug/ml gentamicin. After 2 h, 100 ul of a solution containing 25 ul of purified antibody in RPMI media and 75 ul of Ml 99 complete media containing VEGF (20 ng/ml) were added to each well.

Fig 2 shows a plot comparing the neutralization capacity of the humanized mMcA-AB 1-anti-VEGF-A on the VEGF-A induced proliferation of HUVEC in culture, and the neutralization capacity of the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab in the art. EXAMPLE 10: In vivo Activity of the Anti-VEGF Antibodies IIB-Mel-J cells (Guerra, L., et al., Characterization of IIB-MEL-J: a new and highly heterogeneous human melanoma cell line. Pigment Cell Res, 1989. 2(6): p. 504-9) were used to study the tumor growth inhibition in nude mice. IIB-Mel-J cells were maintained in culture with DMEM medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 5 g/ml insulin and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were grown at 37° C, in 5% C02 until confluence, harvested, counted, washed and resuspended in sterile Matrigel at a concentration of 50 x 106 cell/ml. Xenografts were established in 4-6 week-old Nude Swiss mice by injecting 5x 106 IIB-Mel-J cells into the dorsal flank of the mice. After 6 days were tumors were palpable, mice were randomly distributed into 10 groups (n=10) and intraperitoneally injected twice weekly with either PBS (control group) or different antibodies in PBS in three different concentrations each as follows: group A, mice injected with 0.1 ml of PBS; group B, mice injected with 0.1 ml of the ABl antibody at a dose of 1 μg/mouse; group C, mice injected with 0.1 ml of the ABl antibody at a dose of 25 μg/mouse; group D, mice injected with 0.1 ml of the humanized version of ABl antibody at a dose of 1 μg/mouse; group E, mice injected with 0.1 ml of the humanized version of ABl antibody at a dose of 25 μg/mouse; group F, mice injected with 0.1 ml of the humanized version of Bevacizumab (Avastin™) at a dose of 1 μg/mouse and group G, mice injected with 0.1 ml of the AvastinTM antibody at a dose of 25 μg/mouse. Tumor growth was followed measuring length and width with a caliber instrument and the volume estimated with the following formula: ½ length x width . Animals were killed at day 40 and tumors excised and weighed. The results show that there was a significant inhibition of tumor growth when both, AB 1 and the humanized version of ABl antibodies were administered in all the assayed doses to mice in comparison with mice injected with PBS (p< 0.001) (Fig 3). On the other hand, tumors of animals treated with the ABl and humanized ABl antibodies were, after 40 days of treatment, in average smaller than tumors treated with Bevacizumab at both of the assayed doses (Fig 4). Comparison between the humanized version of ABl and Bevacizumab are shown in Fig.5. At the 25 μg/mouse differences between these two antibodies were statistically significant (p< 0.001). It is worth mention that all the assayed antibodies lack significant neutralizing activity to mouse VEGF (Liang W, Wu X, Peale FV et al.

JBC 281: 951-961 (2006) and EXAMPLE 1) a fact that renders comparison between its anti-tumor activities meaningful.
