The invention concerns a method for mechanically processing an organ or organs taken out from slaughtered poultry in a processing device or processing line, which organ or organs form part of an organ package and wherein said organ or organs are reoriented with the processing device before being separated from the organ package. Usually the organ package taken out from the poultry includes the intestines. The invention also relates to a processing line for harvesting an organ or organs from an organ package taken out from slaughtered poultry, which processing line comprises at least one processing device for processing an organ or organs from said organ package. EP-A-1 769 681 teaches a method and device for mechanically processing a cluster of organs of a slaughtered animal, wherein the cluster is taken out of and separated from the body of the slaughtered animal. A clamping device is used to fix a particular organ within the cluster which cluster is conveyed along a predetermined path. Then tissue connections in the cluster are broken on the basis of the spatial orientation of the cluster which is derived from the spot where the concerning organ is clamped. In this known device separation of the intestines from the viscera package is executed by application of helical rollers that are driven in opposite directions with respect to each other, and wherein the organ package is fixed by clamping means above the rollers. US 2008/0160892 discloses a method and apparatus for harvesting livers and hearts from a viscera package comprising an infeed pinch roller assembly without means to fix the viscera package above the roller assembly, which is provided with an intestine pull down and a liver and heart separator assembly. The viscera package is supplied to a pair of counter rollers, wherein the package is captured by infeed pinch rollers thereby forcing the package into and between the rollers with only the gizzard remaining on top of the rollers. The left and right rollers converge along a nip line and the space between the rollers is sufficient to allow the liver and heart and the intestines to pass therethrough. The liver and heart are isolated and separated by a pulldown stripper assembly and a stripper arm assembly downstream of the rollers. From EP-A-2 103 222 a separator is known comprising two cooperating rollers that are at least in part circumferentially provided with grooves, wherein said first rollers define a preferably adjustable nip between said rollers for selectively allowing preselected organs from an organ package to pass through. During operation said rollers rotate in opposite directions in order to convey the organ packages and simultaneously promote said preselected organ or organs to pass through said nip. This document also discloses that the rollers define a narrowing nip as seen in the conveying direction of said rollers, so as to cause that preselected organs are moved through said nip at the wider part of the nip whilst preselected other organs remain supported and conveyed by said rollers. US 4,382,313 discloses a processing device for harvesting gizzards. The device comprises two cooperating rollers defining a nip between the rollers, each rotatably mounted at opposite ends in bearing blocks. The bearing blocks are adjustable so that the rollers can be shifted with respect to each other. Usually the bearing blocks are adjusted so that the rollers are generally parallel to each other and horizontally aligned, spaced apart at a distance which -due to the construction of the rollers- is variable along their length. Said rollers have infeed and discharge ends with a tapered portion in between. The infeed portion has a first thread crest diameter, and the discharge portion has a second thread crest diameter being larger than the first thread crest diameter, whereas the said tapered portion has a thread crest diameter which increases from the first thread crest diameter at the infeed portion to the second thread crest diameter at the discharge portion. The nip between the rollers varies accordingly. From NL 8502785 a device is known for separation gizzards from intestines taken out of slaughtered poultry, comprising two parallel counterrotating rollers, which each have corresponding screw like circumferential ribs serving for conveying the said gizzards and intestines. The forward ends of the rollers develop into a part with more densely provided ribs that eventually end into ribs having opposite pitch. In general, methods and processing lines for mechanically processing an organ or organs taken out from slaughtered poultry with the aim to harvest the separate organs from the organ package are suffering from diverse problems such as that organ packages or organs thereof are lost during processing, damage occurs to organs such as the liver and the heart and unintentionally certain organs such as gallbladders are not removed or organs are not entirely separated and cause obstructions in the processing line. In certain prior art the packages are accelerated on top of the rollers which means that the processing time is relatively short. Another disadvantage may be that dirt is gathered at or near the rollers. With the invention it is intended to address at least some of these problems and to provide an alternative solution to existing methods and machines for processing an organ or organs that form part of an organ package and is taken out of slaughtered poultry. To this end a method, a processing device and a processing line are proposed in accordance with the appended claims. One aspect of the invention relates to a processing device for processing an organ package taken out from slaughtered poultry, comprising at least two cooperating rollers that define a nip between said rollers for selectively allowing preselected organs from said organ package to pass through said nip, which rollers during operation rotate in opposite directions in order to convey the organ package and simultaneously promote that said preselected organs pass through said nip. In practice it is desirable that the nip can be adjusted. In the prior art this can be done by adjusting the distance of the rollers at the entrance side which receives the organ packages. The nip between the rollers then converges in the conveying direction of the rollers from a wider part to a narrower part. In the prior art this has the consequence that many organ packages are lost shortly or immediately after placement at the entrance side of the rollers. In the processing device of the invention it is promoted that escape of small or weak gizzards through the nip between the rollers and loss of the complete organ package is prevented, by arranging that the cooperating rollers are adjustable exactly perpendicular and transverse to the rollers longitudinal direction so as to provide that the nip is adjustable to a preestablished and constant value which applies along the entire longitudinal direction of the rollers. This feature can be applied independent from the other features of the invention mentioned herein as well as independent from the following features. In another embodiment of the processing device of the invention at least one of the cooperating rollers is adjustable with respect to the other roller in its longitudinal direction so as to adjust the nip between the rollers. The nip is then not necessarily constant throughout the length of the rollers but this may be desirable in certain circumstances. In yet another embodiment of the processing device of the invention in which the rollers are provided with grooves, it may also be beneficial that at least one of the cooperating rollers is adjustable with respect to the other roller in its longitudinal direction so as to adjust a space provided by the respective grooves in the direction of the nip of the cooperating rollers. This space can then be occupied by one of the organs residing on top of the rollers which should be caught and moved through the nip to have the organ suspend below the rollers. Also this feature can be applied independent from or in addition to the other features discussed herein. It is possible to arrive at the same effect by phase-adjusting at least one of the cooperating rollers in its rotational position with respect to the other roller. A limited and temporary additional rotation of one of the rollers is sufficient to adjust a space provided by the respective grooves in the direction of the nip of the cooperating rollers. In yet another aspect of the invention which can be applied independent from the other features disclosed herein, the rollers have a cross-sectional diameter, the value of which diameter varies as seen in the longitudinal direction of the rollers depending on the location of the cross-section between an entrance portion and an exit portion of said rollers so as to provide each of the rollers with a superficial curved contour. Essentially according to this aspect of the invention the rollers are characterized in that they are embodied with a superficial curved contour, which surprisingly results in an improved positioning of the gizzard on top of the rollers, wherein the remainder of the organ package, notably the heart, the liver and the intestines are effectively guided through the nip to a position below the rollers enabling an effective further processing for separating the organs from each other. Preferably the varying cross-sectional diameter of the rollers provides that each roller exhibits one or more portions with relatively small diameters and one or more portions with relatively large diameters in comparison with each other. This provides the advantage that the packages are repeatedly accelerated, decelerated, again accelerated etc. so that a massaging effect on the organ package is reached that effectively forces the above-mentioned remainder of the organ package below the rollers. In a further aspect the rollers' portions with relatively small diameters and the portions with relatively large diameters are preferably intermittently provided in the longitudinal direction of the rollers. Due to this intermittent positioning of the portions with small diameters and portions with large diameters the organ package is moved from left to right and back while the package is being conveyed in the transport direction of the rollers. This brings about that the conveying speed of the organ packages is reduced which enables a more effective separation between the gizzard on top of the rollers and the remainder of the organ package below the rollers. Further it brings the advantage that portions of the organ package that are suspended unintentionally from the rollers on a side of these rollers distant from the nip, will be moved back particularly at the thicker portions of the rollers and moved through the nip to be suspended from the gizzard moving on top of the rollers. A preferred embodiment of the processing device of the invention has the feature that the rollers have superficial contours generally following the shape of a sinus or cosines. In one aspect of the invention which can be applied independent from the other features discussed herein the superficial curved contours of cooperating first and second rollers are matching with each other so as to provide that a portion of the first roller with a relatively small diameter lies adjacent to a portion of the second roller with a relatively large diameter, and vice versa. The nip can then be predominantly constant along the length of the rollers which supports that escape of small or weak gizzards from the top of the rollers, and therewith loss of the complete organ package is prevented. Independent from the foregoing features or in addition thereto it is preferred that the rollers are provided with pockets around the rollers' circumference. The pockets serve the purpose of catching the organs and providing room for them to move these organs through the nip to below the rollers. Such pockets can also be effectively applied with prior art straight rollers. It is desirable that the pockets are provided in different types, each type having a different depth than another type to suit for the different sizes of the organs that have to be caught. It is preferable that the pockets are provided with edges that are rounded in order to prevent that the organs are damaged. By selecting the appropriate level in which the edges are rounded it is also possible that the pockets effectively loosen the liver from the gizzard. It is found that the most preferential placing of the pockets is around the roller's circumference at portions of the rollers where said rollers exhibit relatively large diameters. The invention is also embodied in a processing line embodied with one or more processing devices with the features as discussed herein. The invention will hereinafter be further elucidated with reference to the drawing of a non-limiting processing device according to the invention embodied with a combination of preferred features. It is however expressly remarked that these features can also be applied independent from each other. To save on space it is believed that the skilled person is able to imagine how particular features can be applied separate from the other features. It is further remarked that particular features as discussed herein, such as the pockets provided at the circumference of the rollers can be applied with similar effect in a processing device with rollers that are straight in accordance with the prior art. Evidently such straight rollers with pockets as described herein are also covered by the invention. In the drawing: figure 1 shows a top view of the rollers of a processing device according to the invention;figure 2 shows a top view of rollers in a first relative longitudinal position and a top view of rollers in a second relative longitudinal position with respect to each other;figure 3 shows a cross section of the rollers of figure 1; andfigure 4 shows a cross section of a single roll showing a particular aspect of the applied pockets in the circumference of the roll. Whenever in the figures the same reference numerals are applied, these numerals refer to the same parts. In the following the description is for clarity reasons restricted to showing a processing device in accordance with the invention. It is within the ambit of the skilled person to apply such a processing device in a processing line. Consequently it is abstained from showing the machines or machine parts that constitute such a processing line, since those features are known to the skilled person. It is also abstained from showing the organ package or packages that may be treated and processed in the processing device of the invention, since such organ packages are also known to the skilled person. Moreover the organ packages as such are not part of the protective scope of the invention. Turning now first to figure 1 the two cooperating rollers 1, 2 of the processing device of the invention are shown in a top view. The rollers 1, 2 define a nip 3 between said rollers 1, 2 for selectively allowing preselected organs from an organ package to pass through said nip 3. To arrange that the rollers 1, 2 rotate in opposite directions as shown in figure 3 in order to convey the organ package and simultaneously promote that said preselected organs pass through the nip 3. As clearly follows from what is shown in figure 1 and figure 3 the rollers 1, 2 have a cross-sectional diameter, the value of which varies as seen in the longitudinal direction of the rollers and depends on the location of the cross-section between an entrance portion 4 and an exit portion 5 of said rollers 1, 2 so as to provide each of the rollers 1, 2 with a superficial curved contour 10. According to what figure 1 shows the rollers 1, 2 preferably have superficial contours 10 that generally follow the shape of a sinus or cosines. Figure 1 depicts that the varying cross-sectional diameter of the rollers 1, 2 provides that each roller 1, 2 exhibits one or more portions A with relatively small diameters and one or more portions B with relatively large diameters in comparison with each other. It is also shown that the portions A with relatively small diameters and the portions B with relatively large diameters are intermittently provided in the longitudinal direction of the rollers 1, 2. Furthermore the superficial curved contours of the cooperating first and second rollers 1, 2 are matching with each other so as to provide that a portion A of the first roller 1 with a relatively small diameter lies adjacent to a portion B of the second roller 2 with a relatively large diameter, and vice versa. Making further reference to figure 1 the double arrow C illustrates that the cooperating rollers 1, 2 are adjustable exactly perpendicular and transverse to the rollers 1, 2 longitudinal direction so as to provide that the nip 3 is adjustable to a preestablished constant value X which applies along the entire longitudinal direction of the rollers 1, 2. Figure 2 shows another option to adjust the width of the nip 3 to a desired value. The top part of figure 2 shows the rollers 1, 2 in a first longitudinal position corresponding to what is shown in figure 1. The lower part of figure 2 illustrates the effect in an embodiment of the processing device of the invention in which at least one of the cooperating rollers 1 is adjustable in its longitudinal direction with reference to the other roller 2 so as to adjust the nip 3 between the rollers 1, 2. The longitudinal displacement of the roll 1 is indicated with arrow D. The figure 2 also shows the effect with reference to the positioning of the grooves 6, 7 on the rollers 1, 2; that is to say in one embodiment one roll 1 of the cooperating rollers 1, 2 is phase-adjusted in its rotational position with respect to the other roll 2 by a limited rotation of roll 1 according to arrow E so as to adjust a space 11 provided by the respective grooves 6, 7 in the direction of the nip 3 of the cooperating rollers 1, 2. In another embodiment this is done by providing that at least one roll 1 of the cooperating rollers 1, 2 is adjustable in its longitudinal direction with respect to the other roll 2 of the cooperating rollers 1, 2. Also then it is possible to adjust the space 11 provided by the respective grooves 6, 7 in the direction of the nip 3 of the cooperating rollers 1, 2. In the top part of figure 2 the cooperating grooves 6, 7 provide more room for receiving an organ therein than the staggered grooves 6, 7 do which are shown in the lower part of figure 2. It is remarked that in a particular embodiment part of the grooves may have an opposite pitch with reference to the remainder of the grooves. Such an application of grooves with different pitches is known from the prior art. Returning again to figure 1 one of the other features of the invention is shown, notably that the rollers 1, 2 are provided with pockets 8 around the rollers' circumference. This is also shown in the cross-sectional view of figure 4. It is preferred that the pockets 8 are provided in different types, each type having a different depth than another type. This is not shown in the figures but requires no further elucidation for the skilled person. Preferably the pockets 8 are provided with edges 9 that are rounded. From figure 1 it is clear that the pockets 8 are provided with around the roller's circumference at portions of the rollers 1, 2 where said rollers exhibit relatively large diameters, that is in the regions that are depicted with B.
