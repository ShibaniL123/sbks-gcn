Step 3: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl 2-chloro-7-oxo-4,6-dihydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3c)
To a solution of tert-butyl 2-amino-7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3b) (0.473 g, 1.76 mmol) in anhydrous ACN (33 mL) under inert atmosphere at -20°C was added isoamyl nitrite (0.710 mL, 5.27 mmol). After 10 min at -20°C, Copper(II) chloride (0.473 g, 3.52 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at -20°C, then 4 h at rt. The solution was extracted with DCM, washed with 10% of Na2CO3 aqueous solution. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. The product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/EtOAc 98/2) to give tert-butyl 2-chloro-7-oxo-4,6-dihydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3c) (0.458 g, 1.59 mmol, 90%) as an off-white solid.
