1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[2-(S)-2-(carboxy)-4-(R)-4-(hydroxy)pyrrolidin-1-ylcarbonyl]benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[2-(S)-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-4-(R)-4-(hydroxy)pyrrolidin-1-ylcarbonyl]benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Method 21; 23 mg, 0.030 mmol) was dissolved in THF:H2O (1:1, 1ml). Lithium hydroxide (monohydrate, 2 mg, 0.048 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours. 50% Starting material remained so additional lithium hydroxide (3 mg) was added and left for an hour. The reaction was still not complete so further lithium hydroxide (2 mg) was added and the reaction was stirred overnight. The product was purified by preparative HPLC using a MeCN/0.1 M ammonium acetate buffer gradient (5/95 to 100/0) as eluent to give the title compound 12 mg (53%). M/z 753.04.
