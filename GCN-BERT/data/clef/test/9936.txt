Field of the invention The present invention falls within the field of modern biotechnology applied to algae, specifically Phycotechnology. More specifically, it falls within the area of developing clean technologies for purifying and capturing harmful gases or greenhouse gases, as well as in the area concerned with producing biomass from unicellular algae for the industrial manufacture of processed and energetic products for consumption. The main application focuses on the transformation of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, into biomass by means of the (ultraintensive) cultivation of certain species of unicellular algae, including several different strains simultaneously in monoculture, in closed systems such as vertical annular photobioreactors. This makes it possible to obtain from the biomass other products that are incorporated into the food chain, mainly lipids and proteins, before obtaining final biofuel. In this way the intentions is to achieve an energy-efficient process and prevent the emission of liquid and gas pollutants into the environment. State of the art It has been found that average energy needs at the global level have now increased from 2300 kcal/day per person in 1980 to 2800 kcal/day per person in 2010. Furthermore, this figure is estimated to reach 3100 kcal/day per person by 2030. This, combined with the population growth that is being recorded, has pushed us to search for alternatives that can complement traditional food chain systems. In parallel, there is growing concern about the thinning of the ozone layer and to the need of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, among which the most important are CO2 and CH4. Finally, the post-petroleum era is coming closer and closer, and for this reason we are working on finding energy alternatives that are effective and not largely dependent on weather conditions. Unicellular algae do not compete with any current staple food, they have an outstanding reproductive capacity and only need sun, a few nutrients and CO2, in addition to water, in order to be cultivated. This water should be salty, so that they do not compete with the drinking water needs of the population. Patent application EP 2371940 A1 discloses a process and an installation for the production of biofuels and reduction of CO2 from punctual sources of emission. To this end, it employs non-annular tubes measuring less than 0.1 m in diameter and up to 80 metres in length. This does not lead to equal irradiation conditions across the tubes, resulting in a low surface/volume ratio, which in turn causes biomass production to decrease proportionally. In addition, the treatment of the biomass obtained in the process is carried out conventionally, wherein compounds and processed products such bio-oil or biofuel are obtained jointly. This kind of process, such as that presented in application EP 2371940 A1, requires a drying step between the steps of separation of the biomass and the extraction of compounds, which is energy inefficient. Document US 2008086938 A1 focuses on the overall description of the CO2 collecting process and subsequent recycling into biofuel. In this case, also after obtaining biomass, biofuel is obtained in a single process. International patent application WO 2007147028 A2 describes the necessary equipment for capturing CO2 and introducing it into photobioreactors, mentioning a separation process, and describing a final extraction of biomaterials, although the claims only explain constituent elements of the CO2 collecting system and their introduction into the photobioreactors, as well as the different photobioreactor options. Document ES 2370583 A1 discloses photobioreactors and accumulation tanks, without mentioning the rest of the process to obtain biomaterials. Patent application US 4868123 A relates only to the photobioreactors, but does not introduce the improvements discussed in this patent application that make it much more efficient. This document only relates to a type of photobioreactor for cultivating microalgae which operates differently than that which is disclosed in the present invention, not including a cleaning system or the possibility of all air-water operation, in parallel and crossover. Additionally, it does not mention any sort of subsequent process to that of cultivating microorganisms. Document ES 2356653 A1 describes an invention with conical photobioreactors that are submerged inside a tank. Document US 2007048859 A1 includes the steps of cultivating microalgae from the cultivation area with photobioreactors, CO2 collecting and subsequent treatment of the biomass to obtain a final product based on the biofuel. To this end, it uses photobioreactors without a cleaning system and in a single arrangement, conventional drying systems and a single thermochemical treatment for obtaining biofuel without additional processes for obtaining value-added products. All of this is intended to be carried out without any combination of species or the reuse of rejects. In light of the aforementioned documents, the present invention aims to improve the efficiency of the processes for obtaining biomass from unicellular algae and extracting value-added products therefrom, by improving on the sequence of the steps of obtainment, separation and extraction, thus making it possible to carry out the process while wet, or to recover the rejects of the process in order to treat them and subsequently reintroduce them into the water and gas lines, as well as by improving the facilities designed for this purpose. General description of the invention The present invention relates to the process for the full conversion of harmful gases, such as greenhouse gases, into products from which subsequent industrial benefit may be derived in the energy and food sectors, both for humans and for animals, by the ultra-intensive cultivation of unicellular algae and with the addition of sea, fresh and/or salty water, sunlight and nutrients, all by means of a closed cycle and making use of all the surplus in each of the stages. Specifically, the invention is directed at a process for producing biomass and products derived therefrom by cultivating unicellular algae in an aqueous medium supplied with a CO2 current in an assembly of photobioreactors, comprising: injecting a current of sea, salty or fresh water into the photobioreactors as a culture medium for the algae, previously enriched with nutrients, microfiltered and disinfected,injecting a strain of at least one species of unicellular algae into the photobioreactors, and placing said strain in contact with the enriched water current under light conditions for the culture to grow by means of photosynthesis;injecting a current of gases containing CO2 into the photobioreactors, characterised in that it further comprisesextracting part of the algae culture from the photobioreactors, storing in a accumulation tank and sending to a separate unit to extract the biomass by means of mechanical and/or chemical separation, such that the obtained biomass has a humidity degree comprised between 50 % and 90 %;subjecting the wet biomass to decantation and/or cavitation in a separate unit in order to extract part of the lipids and/or fatty acids and other added-value products along with a first reject, passing the remaining biomass on to the following step;subjecting the remaining biomass from the preceding step to direct, low-temperature, heat liquefaction in a separate unit in order to produce a biocrude and a second reject, all this at a temperature comprised between 250 °C and 350 °C and a pressure comprised between 150 and 210 bar, both limits included, for a time comprised between 1 and 120 minutes;recovering the rejects from both the step of lipid, fatty acid and other added-value product extraction and the subsequent step of thermochemical treatment under subcritical conditions, storing each reject in separate chambers and subjecting to physico-chemical treatment based on adjusting salinity, pH, microfiltration, disinfection and addition of nutrients, for subsequent reintroduction into the culture. Biocrude should be understood as the renewable equivalent of a heavy petroleum-fossil fuel oil, in the present case, however, obtained from algae biomass. Refining biocrude makes it possible to obtain a large variety of compounds, such as naphtha, biofuel and bio-oils, etc. The present process holds many advantages over the state of the art, mainly the accumulation and subsequent treatment of the algae culture extracted from the photobioreactors in wet conditions (wet biomass), as well as recovering all the rejects or surplus generated in the various mechanical and/or chemical separation processes used to obtain lipids and/or fatty acids and/or added-value products, the subsequent heat treatment and final optimisation process for the end biocrude. Another improvement resides in the process for treating the biomass once it has been extracted, in order to obtain added-value products such as lipids and fatty acids and other added-value products, such as vitamins, antioxidants such as beta-carotene and astaxanthin, hormones, etc., which may be used in the agro-food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics or biomedical industries, following to guidelines set out in "Selective extraction of carotenoids from the microalga Dunaliella salina with retention of viability" (Hejazi MA, de Lamarliere C, Rocha JM, Vermuë M, Tramper J, Wijffels RH; Biotechnol Bioeng. 2002-Jul) or in "Production of cell mass and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in ultra high cell density cultures of Nannochloropsis Sp. (Eustigmatophyceae)" (NingZoy, Chengwu Zhang, Zvi Cohen & Amos Richmond, 2000; European Journal of Phycology, 35:2, 127-133). Lipids, fatty acids and other added-value products are produced before the biocrude is extracted rather than in the same single-step method, as is the case in conventional processes (for example EP 2371940 A1). The method for extracting lipids, fatty acids and other added-value products, using either decantation and/or cavitation means, is carried out prior to the heat liquefaction process, wherein biocrude is extracted. In the present invention, the three processes cited are clearly separated and differentiated from one another and are performed in independent units and machines, which largely optimises the results in comparison with those obtained when the processes are carried out jointly, in addition to enabling the complete recovery of the rejects from the various processes, see "Hydrothermal Treatment (HTT) of Microalgae: Evaluation of the Process as Conversion Method in an Algae Biorefinery Concept" (Laura García Alba, Cristian Torri, Chiara Samori, Jaapjan van der Sped, Daniele Fabbri, Sascha R.A. Kersten and Derk W.F. Brilman (2011). Thermo-Chemical Conversion of Biomass Group, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Twente, P.O. Box 217, Enschede, The Netherlands). Furthermore, the fact that this process is carried out in consecutive steps makes it possible to start with a wet extracted biomass, without the need for drying, with a high degree of humidity, in fact, to obtain products such as lipids, fatty acids, added-value products, biocrude and, if possible in preferred cases, finally biofuel. Recovering waste generated in these processes, for example the first reject produced in the mechanical and/or chemical biomass extraction step, from the steps in which lipids, fatty acids and other added-value elements are extracted, as well as from the reject produced in the steps in which biocrude is obtained, makes a relevant contribution to the development of this kind of methods, since the reintroduction thereof into the process as a raw material, following a prior conditioning process, increases the efficiency of the overall process considerably. The waste obtained in these steps fundamentally, and in by a large percentage, are a culture with a lower concentration of algae after the initial mechanical and/or chemical separation. Their conditioning by physico-chemical treatment thereof is based on the adjustment of salinity, pH, microfiltration, disinfection, addition of nutrients and agitation, for subsequent reintroduction into the culture. Between 50 % and 99 % of culture which is periodically extracted and treated for biomass extraction becomes a reject product for next step and thus is returned to the culture after the prior treatment discussed in the present paragraph. The present process does not uses antibiotics or fungicides, so that the obtained products have a higher quality that the conventional processes in which they are used (see, for example, international application PTC/ES2007/000733). Another advantage worth noting is the use of different species in the same biomass production and treatment plant, as a monoculture (each one separated in a different area), such as a lipid-rich species and a second low-lipid species, which complement each other to produce a fuel that is rich in hydrocarbons. A second object of the present invention consists of a plant for producing biomass and products derived therefrom by cultivating at least one unicellular algae species in aqueous medium supplied with a gas current containing CO2 in a set of photobioreactors according to the process described in any one of the preceding claims, comprising: at least one unit for the collecting, storage and injection of the sea, fresh and/or salty water current connected to a nutrient injection unit that injects nutrients into said current before entering the photobioreactors, and to a microfiltration and disinfection unit;at least one unit for the collecting, storage and injection of the gas current containing CO2 into the photobioreactors; both units being connected to a set of two or more photobioreactors of annular vertical and circular type connected to each other for producing biomass by means of cultivating at least one species of unicellular algae; characterised in that it further comprises means for extracting part of the culture from inside the photobioreactors and an accumulation tank thereof, connected to a mechanical extraction unit and/or to a wet biomass chemical extraction unit;a unit for extracting lipids and/or fatty acids and/or other added-value products by means of cavitation, decantation and/or dissolution of the biomass; connected toa thermochemical treatment unit for producing biocrude by means of direct, low-temperature, heat liquefaction from the surplus biomass in the unit for extracting lipids and/or fatty acids and/or other added-value products;a storage chamber for the first reject produced in the mechanical extraction unit and/or in the chemical extraction chamber, with means for recirculating said reject to the unit for injecting the water current into the photobioreactors after conditioning thereof inside the storage chamber; anda storage chamber for the second reject produced in the unit for extracting lipids and/or fatty acids and/or added-value products and in the thermochemical treatment unit, with means for recirculating said reject to the unit for injecting the water current into the photobioreactors after conditioning thereof inside the storage chamber. The described plant makes it possible to carry out the process object of the present specification optimally, reaching values that are 7 times greater than the surface/volume ratio of the plant, thus increasing the production of biomass by this amount, which amount is higher than those recorded in the state of the art. It has been found that the optimum ratio of the plant described is up to 180 litres/m2 of culture in the seeding area as opposed to the 25 litres/m2 of culture known in the state of the art, with conventional photobioreactors that are similar to that of the present specification. Detailed description of the invention Regarding the biomass production process, it is worth noting that the gas current may be a current made up entirely of CO2, or as an alternative may be a mixture of gases from a combustion process. Optionally, the gas current which is a mixture may be washed, compressed, and the CO2 may be separated from the rest of the substances contained therein, such as SOx, NOx, and ashes, prior to being introduced into the photobioreactors. This adaptation of the gas current prior to being injected is performed by cooling the gases if needed so that the maximum temperature thereof is always bellow 40 °C, and separation thereof is performed according to the aforementioned types. Also preferably, but not by way of limitation, gas current may be mixed with compressed air prior to being introduced into the photobioreactors, regardless of whether said current is only CO2 or a mixture of gases. In a particular embodiment, the gas current is injected radially into the photobioreactor. Preferably, said injection is performed by means of a diffuser that is integrated between the tubes making up the photobioreactor, in a radial fashion, and covering the entire perimeter of the tube, said diffuser being placed in the mean radius between outer tube and the inner tube with holes drilled in it so as to enable the CO2 to exit with or without compressed air. Said injection is preferably carried out discontinuously, in pulses with a duration comprised between 1 and 3600 seconds at time intervals comprised between 1 to 3600 seconds, both limits included. This discontinuity, together with the cycles of the cells in the culture, promotes fixing of greenhouse effect gases. Since both chemical and biological collecting by unicellular algae of the gas current containing CO2 is between 45 % and 60 %, a system for collecting surpluses that come out the top of the photobioreactors may be incorporated in the plant, for subsequent reintroduction thereof into the plant's gas line via the corresponding plant compressors, mixing tanks and piping and associated control system. The gas collecting efficiency increased up to a value comprised between 60 % and 90 % with this alternative. Preferably, the gas current is injected by an amount comprised between 0.2 m3/m3 of culture and 2 m3/m3 of algae culture. After water collection, it is subsequently (micro-) filtered depending on its salt content, especially if the water is seawater, along with removal of organic material and oily products, and micro-filtering of clays and other undesired elements in accordance with the type of unicellular algae being cultivated. The water current may be enriched with macronutrients, micronutrients and/or trace elements, in a percentage comprised between 10 % and 30 % by weight of the obtained biomass. Specifically, nutrients may be selected from nitrogenised salts such as nitrate and ammonium, phosphates and any combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment and alternatively to the usual air-lift in the operations of this kind of photobioreactors in terms of the liquid-air flow conditions, the water current can be rotated inside the photobioreactors in the opposite direction to the injection of the bubbles with the gas in question when both are put in contact. This enhances the absorption of the gas by the unicellular algae. It is a chemical effect consisting of the fact that, by opposing the flow of the fluid to that of the CO2 bubbles, a larger collecting surface is obtained, and absorption yield is improved. Commonly, but not by way of limitation, the strain is introduced into the plant through one of the photobioreactors, diluting it in the sea, fresh and/or salty water through the existing pump system. It subsequently spreads out from this photobioreactor, 50 % being extracted from the remainder when the concentration is suitable, and seawater is always added to fill out the volume of the photobioreactor. Preferably, culture is maintained inside the photobioreactors at a temperature comprised between 5 °C and 45 °C, still more preferably between 15 °C and 35 °C. In the most preferred embodiment, the algal culture is kept inside the photobioreactors until reaching a concentration comprised between 100 million cells/ml and 600 million cells/ml. Thus an amount of daily culture, which is comprised between 2 % and 50 % of the total volume inside the photobioreactors, may be extracted from the photobioreactor. In a more preferred embodiment, said portion of the algal culture is accumulated or stored after extraction with constant stirring and aeration or air and CO2 supply, which makes it possible to achieve different reactions depending on the characteristics of collected culture. Mechanical separation of the biomass may be performed by means of one of the processes selected from the group consisting of centrifugation, super-centrifugation, decantation and/or filtration, and chemical separation is performed by means of flocculation. If both mechanical and chemical actions are performed in the process, then each of them is carried out in separate units, such that preferably chemical separation of the biomass is performed first and mechanical separation performed second in a sequential way, thus reducing the level of culture in the mechanical separation process with consequent improvements in process efficiency. It is worth pointing out that the biomass that is left over from the mechanical and/or chemical separation processes and that of the extraction of lipids and other products, which is used to obtain bio-crude may be comprised between 80 % and 99 % of the total biomass, since in the previous stage only between 1 % and 20 % of total treated biomass has been extracted. Also in the most preferred embodiment, the first reject, from the biomass separation step, and the second reject, from subsequent processes to obtain lipids and/or fatty acids and/or value-added products and bio-crude are stored under continuous stirring by means of propeller stirrers that ensure complete homogenisation of the product in less than 2 hours, and which may be vertical and/or horizontal, with one or more blades depending on the tank and with aeration or a mixture of air and CO2, and is conditioned before being reincorporated into the line of water to inject into the photobioreactors. As a result of reintroducing of rejects of the conditioned form back into the process and as a product generated in certain moments and under certain temperature and aeration conditions by itself, a film of foam is formed on the top layer of the water current inside the photobioreactors. Thus, in an optional embodiment, the foam may be collected, said foam containing biomass and/or nutrients in a percentage comprised between 1 % and 5 % of the total existing volume in the photobioreactors. In a preferred embodiment of the process, the strain of unicellular algae is selected from the group consisting of eukaryotic microalgae and in particular Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyceae, Rhodophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, diatoms, Dinophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Xanthophytes and Phaeophyceae, and any combination thereof. In the most preferred embodiment, bio-crude is subjected to cavitation, decantation, pressing and/or heat treatment in a separate unit to obtain biofuel (distilled and purified bio-crude). The reject of this step can also be stored, treated and reintroduced into the process like the other rejects and in the same conditions described for them. With regard to the biomass production plant described in the previous section, it is worth noting that the gas capturing unit can be nourished by a current of greenhouse gases, for example coming directly from the smoke stacks of the industrial facilities that emit them. This unit is preferably formed by take-offs from smoke stacks, duct networks, automatic operating systems, accessories and extractors. The plant may further comprise a compressed air injection unit connected to the unit for collecting, storage and cleaning, and injection of the current of gases containing CO2, prior to entering the photobioreactors. The plant may further comprise an accumulation unit for the gases to be injected, so that if the main supply source thereof fails, the process may continue. The capacity of these tanks is such that they allow normal operation of the plant without the usual supplies from one month to four months. The water current collecting, storage and injection unit is made of the consequent systems of pipes, electric pumps and filters, as well as control elements. Preferably, the accumulation tank of sea, fresh and/or salty water has a capacity of between two sixths and four sixths of the total capacity of the culture volume of the plant. The control elements are pH and temperature probes, a conductivity probe, turbidimeters and maximum and minimum levels. This, together with the electrically operated valves associated to the plant management system, enables the sea, fresh and/or salty water that is to be introduced into the feeder tanks of the photobioreactors enter in the ideal conditions. Optionally, the plant comprises from 2 to 5000 photobioreactors. Said photobioreactors are preferably constituted by an outer tube and an inner tube delimiting a space between them, wherein the water and gas currents are injected and where the unicellular algae are cultivated, said space being divided into longitudinal odd number sections from 1 to 9, and the span of the passage inside the tubes being smaller than 5 cm The tubes may have a height equal to or greater than 10 meters. Because the tubes are divided into 3, 5, 7 or 9 longitudinal sections or compartments, the functioning of the light-dark binary cycles is exactly the same throughout the whole section of the tube, therefore achieving much greater efficiency and more control than that which is achieved with the different areas present in a normal cylindrical tube. The inner and outer tubes may preferably be made of plastic materials, both rigid and flexible, with the particular feature that the inner tube may or may not be translucent and that the inner cavity may or not may be used to adjust the temperature of the existing culture in the ring. Even more preferably, the photobioreactors further comprise a translucent concentric tube covering the outer wall of the outer tube. This tube made of transparent material prevents the sun from shining directly onto the outer tube containing the culture and thereby may prevent the photoinhibition effects that occur with high levels of irradiation and greatly reduce the energy requirements for adjusting the temperature of the culture, as well as number of other associated improvements such as reduction in thickness, in turn lowering the production cost of the tubes. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the set of the photobioreactors comprises: an area for mixing the gas current, the water current and a strain of the algae to be cultivated;an area for growing the algae culture; andan area for extracting the culture from inside the photobioreactors. Each area is comprised of specialised photobioreactors for each function, the three areas are connected together in the logical order: the mixing area is connected to the culture growing area and, in turn to the extraction area. That is, the plant has photobioreactors which are used for the mixing or feeding, others which are used for growing, and other final ones for the culture collection. This is achieved with the different arrangements of the tubes inside each photobioreactor, thus varying the separation between them, water-sheet thickness, culture conditions and a number of other parameters allowing for optimal sequential development to optimise the process, as has been explained above. The photobioreactors may be connected to each other by means of pipes buried under ground where the plant is located, the water current with the culture being driven from one photobioreactor to another by the electric pump. The photobioreactors may further comprise electric pumps which are associated to all the network of pipes that interconnect the cultivation area, containing a pump for each group of photobioreactors. With the electrically operated valves installed in the pump zone, it is possible to use the controls to run the system explained in the preceding paragraph and/or in the present one and all others that may be possible. Each one of these pumps makes the water spin in the opposite direction to that of the gas current injection when both are put in contact. In another alternative operating option, the same pump is the one which recirculates the culture through the buried pipes, thus favouring the heat exchange with the ground (at a constant temperature) and thus achieving the highest productivity of the process with the lowest possible energy consumption. In this case, culture recirculation varies between 10 % and 60 % of the unitary volume. The arrangement of the tubes in the set of the photobioreactors shall be that which enables maximal development of the unicellular algae depending on their degree of concentration with respect to the irradiation and temperature at that time. Since these parameters oscillate both through the year and depending on the location of the plant, different alternative designs are combined, while other parameters also vary, such as residence time in each of the configurations, daily extraction percentage, the percentage of recirculation flow over the total volume and nutrient and CO2 supply, in order to obtain the best values for reproduction. Specifically, the arrangement of the tubes or columns in the photobioreactors and in the cultivation area is adapted to the different needs of the culture depending on the time of year and environmental conditions. There are, in the state of the art, photobioreactors formed by tubes with a linear arrangement, others with circular arrangements, and others with double arrangements of these both, such that the distances between the components also vary, thus combining the different possibilities of irradiation/passage span/speed of CO2 and air mixture, to always obtain the best production. In the case of the present invention, as a consequence of the division into areas of the algal culture, the plant is stratified according to the environmental conditions and the different reproductive phases of the culture, so that the plant may be adapted to each time of the year, achieving the best possible efficiency. Irradiation needs in one time of the year are very different from those required in other time, for which reason the path of the culture is adapted from its initial seeding to extraction, and between one extraction and the next. That which has been indicated corresponds to the principles demonstrated in the technical article "Design principles of photo-bioreactors for cultivation of microalgae", by D. Clemens Posten, Institute of Life Science Engineering, Division of Bioprocess Engineering, University of Karlsruhe, Strasse am Forum 8, D-76131 Karlsruhe (Germany), DO1:10.1002/elsc.200900003, 29 May 2009, and in "Microalgal Photobioreactors: Scale-up and optimization", Barbosa, M.J.G.V., 2003. Optionally and preferably, the photobioreactors further comprise an automated device for cleaning the walls of the tubes delimiting the space between the inner tube and outer tube, said cleaning device being constituted by an elastomeric scraper whose plan corresponds to the profile of the space between the tubes and a thickness comprised between 2 and 5 cm, with a central through hole that has a lower frustoconical section and an upper cylindrical section, the hole having the overall shape of an inverted funnel; and a sphere made of plastic material with a larger diameter than the diameter of the cylindrical section of the hole, which moves inside the space defined by the lower frustoconical section of the through hole. The incorporation of this cleaning system allows the plant to operate without the need to empty the photobioreactors, which simplifies maintenance of the facility and efficiency thereof with respect to the prior art. The cleaning device operates as follows: 1.- In the normal position it is at rest at the bottom of the tube, in the cultivation area, i.e., between the outer and the inner tubes.2.- Once it becomes desirable to activate it, the flow direction of the culture is changed from its normal operation (the culture enters through the top part and is collected at the bottom) to the opposite direction, and should the operation being used that in which it is fed from bellow and spills over the top, the flow rate is increased so that the device is activated once it is enough to make the inner sphere rise.3.- The operating time of the device, which is activated because of the changes to the electrically operated valves found in the area of each of the culture pumps, is such that it makes it possible to make the cleaner go upwards without butting up against in the top cover of the photobioreactor.4.- Once the cleaner reaches the top, this option is inhibited, such that it returns to the previous state, and falls under its own weight (its density is greater than that of the culture water) back to its original position. The operation may be repeated from 1 to 50 times a day depending on the internal cleaning state of the tubes, which in turn depends on the species being employed and the conditions under which it is being cultivated. Ultimately, annular vertical tubes are used as photobioreactors, it being possible for a third outer layer to be arranged in different ways inside the photobioreactors, which enable the cultivation area to adapt to existing climatic conditions in each period, differentiating culture recovery areas, mixing areas and the various growth areas prior to the extraction area. This equally results in maximum CO2 absorption being attained in each one of the current environmental conditions. These aspects, in addition to improving both the collection and reproduction efficiencies of the unicellular algae, improve the overall performance of the system, preventing fooling (prokaryotes and unicellular algae stuck to the outer tube) from forming and largely reducing maintenance operations owing to the incorporation of a cleaning system for the tubes, without it being necessary to empty the same. As described above, a foam film may be form on the upper layer of the water current inside the photobioreactors, especially as result of the reintroduction of the reject from the various biomass treatment stages, until the end products desired are obtained. This foam film may even be generated naturally inside the photobioreactors, in certain conditions and at certain times during the reproduction process, even prior to introducing the treated rejects, which contain a high percentage of nutrients and/or biomass. For this reason, the photobioreactors may further comprise means for collecting the foam, based on an upper channelling of the appropriate dimensions according to the volume of the photobioreactor, conveniently driven to an accumulation area generated for this purpose in the plant and drive means (pipes and electric pumps), which drive said foam to the foam accumulation tank for foam coming from the culture extracted from the photobioreactor. It will subsequently be reintroduced back into the photobioreactors supply tank or to the clarification tank, according to the treatment applied and depending on the unicellular alga being cultivated. The top portion of the photobioreactors may also comprise means for collecting the excess CO2 not consumed by the algae culture and means for driving said excess gas from the gas collecting and injecting unit to the photobioreactors, in order for them to be reintroduced. The capacity of the unit for accumulating the culture extracted from the photobioreactors is preferably comprised between half and one tenth of that of the total volume of the plant. It may also have stirrers and supply means with CO2 and/or compressed air and measurement and control systems, to be integrated into the plant operation. The control elements include pH and temperature probes, conductivity probe, turbidimeters, maximum and minimum levels and nutrient control probes. In order to attain optimal biomass production, the storage units for the first and second reject may comprise stirring and aeration means or means for injecting air and CO2 inside, in order to improve the behaviour of the culture and/or the subsequent reincorporation into the cultivation area thereof, it being possible to produce decantation and/or variations in the composition as required. The capacity of each of the reject storage units is normally between half and one tenth the capacity of the total volume of the plant. Optionally and preferably, when both rejects have been treated in their respective storage units, they may be driven to a joint accumulation chamber, where all the rejects treated come together prior to being reintroduced into the process. This accumulation unit for treated rejects is connected at its input to the output in the rejects storage and treatment units, and at its output to the water lines of the plant (means for injecting sea, fresh and/or salty water into the photobioreactors). The photobioreactors may also comprise means for controlling the temperature, which are preferably joint temperature and pH probes very common in the state of the art. They are integrated in line in the network of pipes that carries each photobioreactor, in order to join the different tubes and between one photobioreactors and others, by means of heat pumps of the type condensed by air, by water and/or are geothermal, in order to keep said parameter between 5 °C and 45 °C, as required by the process. Said temperature control or adjustment means are made up of heat pumps of the type condensed by air, condensed by water and/or are geothermal, in order to keep culture in the desired temperature conditions. With the addition of the third concentric outer tube, alongside the two inner tubes between which the culture is found, temperature adjustment needs are reduced considerably, this being one of the aspects that improve the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the plant may incorporate cleaning and disinfection means, which are arranged in line in the network of pipes and electric pumps responsible for the repositioning and extraction processes for the culture of the photobioreactors, as well as in the rejects recovery processes and exchanges in the different tanks, being selected from the group consisting of ultraviolet rays, active carbon filters and/or ozonation, thus meaning no contaminant element is poured to the environment. also as differentiation, as well as means for collecting accidental leaches and spills, formed by driving means and pumping means up to the storage unit for the reject extracted in all the processes for obtaining biomass, from the units for extracting lipids and/or fatty acids and/or added-value products and the thermochemical treatment units. The cleaning and disinfection means are incorporated into the entire pipe system and remaining system elements. These systems differ from the usual ones used up until now, since they do not emit any toxic substance into the environment. The plant, in order to collect accidental leaches and spills, comprises networks of underground pipes, catch basins and electric pumps, which in the event of the culture accidentally being spilt, will be sent to the corresponding reject deposits in order to be treated and subsequently reused in the culture. The plant optionally but not exclusively comprises means for controlling the process formed by sensors, flow meters, electrically operated valves and common elements in an SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system.

Examples Three examples of the present invention are described below, which in no case can be considered limiting examples of the invention. Example 1: In Figure 1, the plant designed and the entire process object of the present invention are described. Starting with an estimated cultivation volume of 100 m3, the process is initiated by introducing these 100 m3 of seawater through the mandatory seawater collection system (8). After having disinfected and filtered (11) the same, it is introduced into the cultivation photobioreactor (6), all of the above being carried out at a grade of filtration of less than 1 micron. The initial strains for inoculating the biomass are also filtered and disinfected (11) prior to being introduced into the photobioreactors (6). The cultivation area operating system is carried out progressively, in such a way that the photobioreactors (6) are firstly filled with less water thickness sheet, and therefore more productivity, and it is subsequently spread out as the optimal concentration is achieved (between 100 M of cells/ml and 600 M of cells/ml) until the entire cultivation area is obtained, at which point the rest of the process may be started. This step may take from several days to several weeks depending on environmental conditions and the volume and concentration of the initial strain used to begin with. During this process, and continuously during normal exploitation of the plant, CO2 is introduced from the gas collection system (1), through its injection means, to the photobioreactors (6), after having been washed in the corresponding unit (2). The amount of gas and compressed air mixture to be introduced depends on the environmental conditions and the state of the culture, however it will be found between the values of 0.2 m3 of air+CO2 per cubic meter of culture and 2 m3 of air+CO2 per cubic meter of culture. As mentioned above, the introduction of air into the system does not necessarily have to be continuous. In an alternative scenario, the culture recirculation pump (5) will act in parallel to the introduction of CO2 and/or CO2+air or alone, if said supply were not necessary, given the state of the culture at certain points in time. The overall ratio of CO2 removed is 1.8 kg/CO2 per each kg of biomass subsequently produced. Auxiliary CO2 tanks (4) are anticipated in the state of the art, which may make up for any lack of CO2 through the usual collection system (1). Meanwhile, nutrients (10) are introduced into the culture, which are mainly nitrogenous salts (nitrate and ammonium) and phosphates, in the proportion required according to the needs and level of development of the same. The total proportion of nutrients added is between 10 % and 30 % of the biomass obtained. The photobioreactors system has been equipped with an upper foam collection system, in such a way that the nutrients and biomass present in this area are exploited (12). A culture temperature adjustment system (15) has been installed, although, with the abovementioned improvements made to the photobioreactors, in terms of incorporating a third outer tube, the use thereof will not be necessary during 98 % of the plant operation period. The working temperature ranges greatly, preferably being at between 15 °C and 35 °C. Moreover, an accidental spill collection system (18) has been installed, which spill would be introduced back into the system after appropriate treatment (11) thereof. Once the optimal degree of culture concentration has been achieved, a daily extraction comprised between 2 % and 50 %, preferably 25 % of the total culture, begins, i.e., between 2 and 50 m3 (9). Meanwhile, despite the fact that most of the water that returns to the cultivation areas, 2 % of that which is extracted, is supplied as new water through the seawater collecting system (8). The culture, at optimal concentrations, is taken to the accumulation tanks (13). This step feeds the decantation/filtration and/or centrifugation equipment (14) which return part of the culture, at between 50 % and 99 % of the total, to the rejection tanks (16), in order for them to be subsequently treated and introduced back into the culture (6). After this stage, a biomass is obtained, which has an approximate weight of between 40 kg/day and 110 kg/day and a humidity of between 50 % and 90 %, suitable for the subsequent introduction thereof into the next process, without any drying process being required. The next step of the process is extracting lipids and/or fatty acids and/or added-value products (20), in which between 4 kg/day and 10 kg/day of added-value products are produced. This is followed by the thermochemical transformation process (21), in which between 20 % and 60 % of bio-crude, between 10 % and 30 % of water, between 1 % and 10 % of char and between 1 % and 30 % of various gases are obtained. This step can be performed with or without a catalyst, and the conditions range between 250 °C and 350 °C and between 150 bar and 210 bar. The processing time can vary between 1 minute and 120 minutes. After this process, a portion of the resulting products are sent back to tanks to be treated and subsequently introduced into the process, and the portion of product obtained as bio-crude goes on to the final conversion to biofuel treatment (22). Different tanks (23) accumulate the products obtained in one or another process prior to their final destination. Finally, between 20 and 50 kg/day of bio-crude are obtained, with a CO2 conversion of between 72 and 198 kg/day.
