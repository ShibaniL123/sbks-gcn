(2) Preparation of 2-(spiro[3.3]heptan-2-yl)isoindolin-1,3-dione
Spiro[3.3]heptan-2-ol (962 mg, 8.6 mmol), phthalimide (1.26 g, 8.6 mmol)and triphenylphosphine (4.51 g, 17.2 mmol) were dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (50 mL), protected with nitrogen gas, diethyl azodicarboxylate (3.0 g, 17.2 mmol) was added dropwise under ice-water bath. After addition, heated to 25Â°C and reacted for 2h, ethyl acetate (150 mL) was added, washed with saturated brine (100 mL), the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuum, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =5:1) to obtain product (1.56 g, yield 75.2%).
