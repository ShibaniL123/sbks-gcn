Background of Invention Parkinson's disease (PD) affects about 1 of 250 people older than 40, about 1 of 100 people older than 65, and about 1 of 10 people older than 80. Merck Manual, Parkinson's Disease, last full review/revision August 2007 by David Eidelberg and Michael Pourfar, available at merckmanuals . com/home/brain_spinal_cord_and_nerve_disorders/movement_di sorders/parkinsons_disease.html (hereinafter "Merck Manual"). What causes PD is unclear. According to one theory, Parkinson's disease may result from abnormal deposits of synuclein (a protein in the brain that helps nerve cells communicate) (Merck Manual) . These deposits, called Lewy bodies, can accumulate in several regions of the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra (deep within the cerebrum) and interfere with brain function (Merck Manual) . Lewy bodies often accumulate in other parts of the brain and nervous system, suggesting that they may be involved in other disorders (Merck Manual) . In Lewy body dementia, Lewy bodies form throughout the outer layer of the brain (cerebral cortex). Lewy bodies may also be involved in Alzheimer's disease (Merck Manual) . Improved and novel methods for diagnosing, confirming, providing biomarkers for, and treating PD are needed.

PD is often diagnosed by a neurologist who can evaluate symptoms and their severity. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Parkinson's Disease Backgrounder, available at www. ninds . nih . gov/disorders/parkinsons_disease/parkinsons_disease_back grounder.htm, last updated October 18, 2004 (hereinafter "NINDS Backgrounder" . According to the National Institute of Neurological disorders and Stroke, there is currently no test that can clearly identify the disease. (NINDS Backgrounder) . Sometimes people with suspected PD are given anti-Parkinson's drugs to see if they respond (NINDS Backgrounder) . Other tests, such as brain scans, can help doctors decide if a patient has true PD or some other disorder that resembles it (NINDS Backgrounder) . Microscopic brain structures called Lewy bodies, which can be seen only during an autopsy, are regarded as a hallmark of classical PD (NINDS Backgrounder) . Autopsies have uncovered Lewy bodies in a surprising number of older persons without diagnosed PD — 8% of people over 50, almost 13% of people over 70, and almost 16% of those over 80, according to one study (NINDS Backgrounder) . As a result, some experts believe PD is something of an "iceberg; phenomenon, " lurking undetected in as many as 20 people for each known Parkinson's patient (NINDS Backgrounder). Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, a few researchers contend that almost everyone would develop Parkinson's eventually if they lived long enough (NINDS Backgrounder) . The present invention provides methods for identifying subjects afflicted with PD that would previously have remained undetected. Aspects of the present invention enable the detection of PD in presymptomatic stages. Additionally, the present invention provides methods for identifying those who might eventually develop PD. PD has an increased prevalence with age. See, for example, the NINDS Backgrounder; and Van Den Eeden et al., (2003) Incidence of Parkinson's Disease: Variation by Age, Gender, and Race/Ethnicity, Am. J. Epidemiol. 157 (11): 1015-1022, the entire content of each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. PD ranks among the most common late-life neurodegenerative diseases, affecting approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of people aged 60 years and older (Patrick Sweeney, Parkinson's Disease, Cleveland Clinic, available at clevelandclinicmeded. com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/neurology /parkinsons-disease/ ) . Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, the peripheral immune response of PD may begin in a subject decades before PD may be diagnosed by a neurologist, and subjects having the peripheral immune response may be identified for earlier therapy using methods of the invention. There are a number of peripheral symptoms associated with PD including orthostatic hypotension and constipation. The present invention provides methods for diagnosing causes of these symptoms, and be used to identify subjects who may benefit from prophylactic treatment for PD. Aspects of the present invention provide an epitope useful as a test/biomarker for PD, which could include identifying patients in preclinical stages or in danger of PD, and to measure disease progression and/or response. As described herein, aspects of the invention provide means to detect these T cells in patient blood. Similar approaches for identifying tuberculosis patients will be known to those skilled in the art. For use of a similar test in TB diagnosis, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuantiFERON, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Additionally, aspects of the invention define which precise T cells and antigens individual patients have, and provide individualized therapy that spare other important immune functions . The test/biomarker test for PD has already been conducted and is effective, as described in the Examples disclosed herein. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, the T cells identified in embodiments of the invention may kill the neurons in PD, and thus be a step in the disease. The present invention provides means to treat PD, as blocking these T cells arrest the disease progression. An example would be tolerization: particular epitopes the T cells recognize are determined, and patients are exposed to the epitope in a form that alters the immune system to recognize it as self, and halt or reduce making killer T cells. In addition to - synuclein, there are additional mutant proteins that cause PD, including LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase . These markers are similarly useful for diagnosing, confirming, providing biomarkers for, and treating PD.

Methods, 65:109, the entire content of each of which is incorporated herein by reference . In some embodiments, the leukocytes are determined to have increased activation after contact with an epitope or test compound if the leukocytes release more of a cytokine than corresponding leukocytes not contacted with the epitope or test compound. In some embodiments, the leukocytes are determined to have increased activation after contact with the epitope or test compound if the leukocytes release about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1,000, or 1-5,000% more of a cytokine than corresponding leukocytes not contacted with the epitope or test compound. Methods for assaying increased cytokine release include but are not limited to the ELISpot assay Western Blot Analysis and ELISA, which will be well understood to those in the art. In some embodiments, the leukocytes are determined to have increased activation after contact with the epitope or test compound if the leukocytes proliferate, and corresponding leukocytes not contacted with the epitope or test compound do not proliferate. In some embodiments, the leukocytes are determined to have increased activation after contact with the epitope or test compound if the leukocytes proliferate more than corresponding leukocytes not contacted with the epitope or test compound. In some embodiments, the leukocytes are determined to have increased activation after contact with the epitope or test compound if the leukocytes proliferate about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, or 200% more than corresponding leukocytes not contacted with the epitope or test compound. In some embodiments the leukocytes are determined to have increased activation after contact with the epitope or test compound if the leukocytes become differentiated after contact with the epitope or test compound, and corresponding leukocytes not contacted with the epitope or test compound do not become differentiated. In some embodiments the leukocytes are determined to have increased activation after contact with the epitope or test compound if the leukocytes are more differentiated than corresponding leukocytes not contacted with the epitope or test compound. Methods for assaying increased proliferation and differentiation are well known in the art, and include cell counting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) . In some embodiments, the leukocytes are determined to have increased activation after contact with the epitope or test compound if the leukocytes express a gene at a higher or lower level than corresponding leukocytes not contacted with the epitope or test compound. In some embodiments, the expression is about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 300 400, 500, 750, 1,000, or 1-5,000% higher or lower than in the corresponding leukocytes.

(1999) Activation changes the spectrum but not the diversity of genes expressed by T cells. PNAS Vol. 96, No. 22, 12691-12696, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Methods for assaying gene expression are well known in the art, and include PCR, RT-PCR, Northern Blot Analysis, and microarray analysis. The release, proliferation, differentiation or change in expression may be measured at, for example, about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, or 72 hours after the leukocytes are contacted with the epitope or test compound. As used herein, a stretch of "consecutive amino acids" means a plurality of amino acids arranged in a chain, each of which is joined to a preceding amino acid by a peptide bond, excepting that the first amino acid in the chain may optionally not be joined to a preceding amino acid. The amino acids of the chain may be naturally or non- naturally occurring, or may comprise a mixture thereof. The amino acids, unless otherwise indicated, may be genetically encoded, naturally- occurring but not genetically encoded, or non-naturally occurring, and any selection thereof. As used herein a therapy that is "directed to leukocytes that are activated by an epitope" is a therapy that selectively reduces or prevents the activation of the leukocytes by the epitope. It will be understood that selectively reducing or preventing the activation of leukocytes by an epitope includes killing the leukocytes or reducing the viability or proliferation of leukocytes that are capable of becoming activated when they are contacted with the epitope. Non- limiting examples of therapies that are directed to leukocytes that are activated by an epitope include administration of a compound that selectively kills leukocytes that are capable of becoming activated when they are contacted with the epitope, and tolerization therapy. As used herein, "tolerization therapy" or "antigen-specific tolerization" comprises exposing a subject with an epitope in a way that alters the subject's immune system to have reduced activation by the epitope. Tolerization therapy results in a decrease in the activation of a leukocyte of the subject, such as a T cell, by the epitope. Tolerization therapy is discussed in Coppieters et al. (2013) Clinical Immunology, 149, 345-355; Billetta et al. (2012) Clin Immunol, 145(2) :94-101; and Lutterotti and Martin (2014) Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, Vol. 23, No. 1, pages 9-20, the entire content of each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Aspects of the present invention relate to a compound comprising a major histocompatibility complex (MHO Tetramer and a toxin. MHC Tetramers are complexes of four Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules which are each associated with a specific molecule. The specific molecule may be an epitope of the invention. In some embodiments, the four MHC molecules are associated with each other via a tetramerization agent. In some embodiments, the MHC Tetramer comprises four MHC monomer fusion proteins, wherein each MHC monomer fusion protein comprises a MHC molecule and biotin. In some embodiments, the tetramerization agent is streptavidin or avidin. In the compound, a MHC Tetramer may be coupled to a toxin by, e.g., a covalent bond, a linker, a streptavidin-biotin interaction or a streptavidin-avidin interaction. In some embodiments, the toxin is covalently bound to the streptavidin or the avidin. There are two types of Tetramers, Class I and Class II. In some embodiments, the HC molecules of a Class I Tetramer are mutated to minimize binding of the MHC molecule to CD8+ cell surfaces.

Experimental Details Examples are provided below to facilitate a more complete understanding of the invention. The following examples illustrate the exemplary modes of making and practicing the invention. However, the scope of the invention is not limited to specific embodiments disclosed in these Examples, which are for purposes of illustration only. Example 1. MHC-I in human catecholamine neurons Human MHC-I consists of an a chain encoded by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C) and a noncovalently associated P2m subunit. A variety of techniques were used to assess the presence of MHC-I in human postmortem samples. First, MHC-I was examined by immunofluorescence using a primary antibody against human HLA a chain (amino acids 63-362) that detects an epitope common in HLA-A, B and C, together with an antibody against Fox-3, a neuronal nuclei marker. Sections of hippocampus with adjacent entorhinal cortex from human controls (59-85 years old) were initially examined. Consistent with previous reports, blood vessels in hippocampus and cortex were labeled for HLA, but no staining was observed in neurons or glia (FIG. 1A) . MHC-II was never observed in neurons. Similarly, HLA immunolabel in sections of the caudate nucleus from control postmortem samples in the same age range was found only in blood vessels and not in glia or neurons (FIG. 1A) . Double immunolabeling for HLA and Fox-3, or HLA and the catecholamine marker, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the ΞΝ and LC of control samples and PD samples was then performed. In sharp contrast to the other brain regions examined, HLA immunolabel was present selectively in many of the TH+ KM containing neurons, as well as blood vessels (FIG. IB and FIG. 7). The presence of MHC-I in SN neurons was independently confirmed by double immunofluorescence label for TH and an antibody against amino acids 1-120 of human β2πι, the β chain component of MHC-I (FIG. 1C) . The 2ϋΐ cellular distribution and neuronal pattern of staining appeared identical to that of the HLA a chain (compare FIG. IB and 1C) . Immunolabel for both MHC-I components was observed throughout the cytosol and often at particularly high levels in regions associated with M in both SN and LC catecholamine neurons (FIG. IB, C, D, and FIG. 7 ) . The specificity of the neuronal MHC-I immunolabel was confirmed by the absence of staining when the respective primary antibodies were pre-adsorbed by recombinant HLA or β2κι peptides (see Example 8) . In SN postmortem material from 8 control individuals, 62.53 ± 8.6 % (mean ± s.e.m.) of TH+ neurons displayed HLA* label, whereas 49.03 ± 8.7 % (mean ± s.e.m.) were labeled in 8 age-matched PD patients (FIG. IE) . Only < 3 % of TH~ SN control neurons and < 7 % of TH~ SN PD patient neurons expressed HLA (PIG. 1G) . In the same sections, no DA neurons were observed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that expressed MHC-I (FIG. 8A) . In the LC, 80.3 ± 1.8 % (mean ± s.e.m.) of TH* neurons were HLA* from 8 control individuals, and 37.3 ± 11.8 % of TH* were HLA* in neurons of 9 age-matched PD patients; this difference was statistically significant (FIG. IF) . No TH" neurons expressed HLA label in LC control samples, and less than 5% TH" did in LC PD (FIG. 1G) . Multiple approaches were then used to corroborate the identification of MHC-I expression in SN neurons obtained by immunofluorescence. To discard artifacts due to autofluorescence, the presence of MHC-I was assessed via immunoperoxidase label . HLA label was clearly present in blood vessels, and negligible in microglia, astrocytes, and NM- neurons (FIG. 8B) . In contrast, clear HLA immunoperoxidase label was observed in both NM+ SN and LC neurons, both in control and PD samples (FIG. 2A) . MHC-II was never observed in neurons. HLA immunolabel was then examined in LC and SN from control samples by immunoelectron microscopy. Consistent with the immunofluorescent images of MHC-I, immunogold label for MHC-I was associated with blood vessels and was clearly present in NM organelles in LC and SN neurons (FIG. 2B, FIG. 8C) . As NM organelles can be efficiently isolated from human SN (Sulzer et al., 2000; Zecca et al., 2008), mass spectrometry was used to detect the presence of MHC proteins in isolated NM organelles and purified NM. A variety of MHC-I components, including peptides corresponding to alleles of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and β2πι genes (FIG. 2C, Table 1 and Table 2), were present in both NM organelles and purified NM; in contrast, no MHC-II peptides were identified in any human SN M samples . The abundance of MHC-I mRNA in human NM+ SN neurons from control samples was then evaluated. Robust expression signals were confirmed for the β2Μ and HLA-A and HLA-C genes in a laser-captured NM+ SN neuron microarray data set (Zheng et al., 2010), comprising nine (FIG. 2D) control individuals without neurodegenerative diseases (mean age at death (range), 75 years (61-80). It is impossible to determine if neuronal MHC-I in postmortem tissue was immunologically competent, but the presence of CTLs in SN and LC would indicate that such interactions could occur. CD8+ and CD4+ cells have been identified previously in human SN in close vicinity to NM+ neurons and are present at particularly high levels in PD (Brochard et al., 2009). Using double immunolabel assay for HLA and CD8+ CTLs in SN and LC control samples, CD8+ CTLs were observed in close proximity to HLA-expressing NM+ neurons in both control (FIG. 2E) and PD specimens (FIG. 8D) ; in some cases, catecholaminergic HLA* neurons and CTLs appeared to be in contact (FIG. 2E) . Example 2. MHC-I induction hES-derived DA neurons CNS neurons in postmortem samples do not retain intact plasma membranes (Lewis, 2002). To confirm that MHC-I can be localized in the plasma membrane of human DA neurons, neuronal cultures derived from hKS that exhibit a range of properties of authentic SN DA neurons were examined (Kriks et al . , 2011). Mature midbrain DA neurons (150 days in culture) displayed a dense TH+ fiber network that extended over distances of several millimeters. IFN~Yis a proinflammatory cytokine found at high levels in cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with neurodegenerative disorders (Solerte et al., 2000; Mogi et al., 2007; Kallaur et al., 2013) that induces MHC-I expression in antigen presenting cells by activating a regulatory element of the MHC-I promoter (van den Elsen et al., 2004) .Untreated DA neurons exhibited no MHC-I; however, human IFN-yinduced plasma membrane expression of MHC-I by virtually all TH+ neurons (FIG. 2F) . In control experiments to assess neuronal specificity, mature motor neurons derived from hES were examined after exposure to human IFN-γ, but no MHC-I expression was observed (PIG. 9A) . Table 1 Table 1: MHC-I peptides associated with NM were identified by mass spectrometry in samples isolated from human SN of normal subjects . NM- Organelles 1 and NM-Organelles 2 were each prepared from two different single subjects. NM isolated from SN tissues was isolated from a pool of SN samples obtained from five subjects.

Induction of neuronal MHC-I in murine catecholamine neurons To study the mechanisms underlying the preferential display of MHC-I by catecholamine neurons, primary neuronal cultures of >7 days in vitro prepared from 0-3 day old C57BL/6 mice were examined in the studies herein (Sulzer et al . , 2008) . DA neurons from VTA and SN and NE neurons of the LC were identified by immunolabel for TH. MHC-I staining was examined using an antibody raised against the H-2Kb and H-2Db class I mouse alloantigens . Untreated TH+ neurons exhibited no MHC-I immunolabel (FIG. 3A) . The response to recombinant mouse IFN-γ was then examined, which induced robust plasma membrane neuronal MHC-I expression on TH+ neurons (FIG. 3A) . Detection of MHC-I immunolabel can be influenced by fixation, and therefore labeling of living neurons was also examined. Immunolabel for MHC-I was absent in control neuronal cultures and was observed in unfixed neurons only following IFN-γ (FIG. 9B) , indicating that detection of neuronal MHC-I was not an artifact of fixation. To confirm that the immunolabel was specific for MHC-I, neurons cultured from MHC-I null ("knockout": KO) mice which are deficient for β2πι (B6.129P2-B2mtmlUnc/J) were examined. As expected, IFN-ydid not induce MHC-I (H-2Kb and H-2Db) immunolabel in these mutant neurons (FIG. 3A) . A series of control experiments was further conducted, in which wild type and KO astrocytes were used combinatorially with wild-type and KO neurons. For each combination, wild type neurons and astrocytes were induced to express MHC-I by IFN-7, while in each case the KO neurons and astrocytes did not express MHC-I. The response to IFN-y of LC and ventral midbrain (VM: SN and VTA) catecholamine neurons was compared to cortical, thalamic, striatal and non-DA SN cultured neurons that were identified by label for the neuron specific cytoskeleton protein, microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) . Catecholamine neurons of the SN, VTA and LC were far more responsive to IFN-ythan were non-catecholamine neurons: even 1000-fold excesses of IFN-γ did not induce non-catecholamine neurons to express MHC-I at the level of catecholamine neurons (compare 100 pg/ml to 100 ng/ml, FIG. 3B) . Exam le 4. Regulation of MHC-I expression by activated microglia Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, the induction of MHC-I in the SN neuronal culture experiments described herein, as well as in prior reports from other neurons (Medana et al., 2000; Meuth et al., 2009), was triggered by IFN-γ. This cytokine is considered to be a product of lymphoid cells, but CNS microglia provide an alternate source of this proinflammatory signal (Kawanokuchi et al., 2006). Activated microglia have long been recognized in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders including PD (Foix and Nicolesco, 1925) . Extracellular NM, which is a remnant of dead SN neurons (Foix and Nicolesco, 1925), and various forms of extracellular a-syn can activate microglia (Zhang et al., 2007; Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011). Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) , it was found that primary microglial cultures exposed to human NM or native a-syn for 72h secreted 5-10 fold more IFN-γ than untreated cells (FIG. 3C) . Control experiments revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) , an inflammatory component from Gram- negative bacteria, also induced IFN-γ secretion in primary microglial culture (FIG. 3C) . Both overexpression and multiple mutations of a-syn are implicated in PD (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997; Singleton et al . , 2003). The effects of conditioned media from microglial cultures exposed to NM or a variety of modified a-syn proteins on neuronal MHC-I expression were examined. The conditioned medium obtained from microglia cultures incubated for 72 hours with NM, a-syn, NM with a-syn, nitrated a-syn (Nit-a-syn) , A53T mutant a-syn (Mut-a-syn) , or LPS, elicited cell surface MHC-I presentation by VM neurons (FIG. 3D) . This induction of MHC-I expression was in part mediated by IFN-γ, as the addition of IFN-γ neutralizing antibody to the conditioned medium decreased MHC-I expression by 30-50% (FIG. 3E) . In contrast, there was no induction of neuronal MHC-I when cultures were directly exposed to equivalent levels of LPS, a-syn, or NM in the absence of microglial cells. These results indicate that substances including NM and a-syn can activate microglia, as demonstrated by the release of IFN-γ, as well as that additional inflammatory factors induce MHC-I display by VM neurons. Primary cortical and striatal neurons were also analyzed for MHC-I expression after exposure to microglial medium pre-incubated for 72 hours with LPS, NM or a-syn under the same conditions used for VM DA cultures. Under these conditions, cortical and striatal neurons also expressed MHC-I, but in a significantly lower proportion than VM DA neurons (FIG. 9C) . Example 5. Regulation of MHC-I expression in response to oxidative stress Protein oxidation has been suggested to provide a "global signal" that induces MHC-I expression (Teoh and Davies, 2004) . DA-derived oxidative stress has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases including PD (Fahn and Sulzer, 2004; Hwang, 2013), in part because cytosolic DA, which is also the precursor to NB in LC neurons, can be metabolized to a quinone that reacts with proteins including a- syn (Conway et al., 2001; Norris et al . , 2005). DA-modified a-syn leads to cellular toxicity and autophagy dysfunction (Martinez- Vicente et al., 2008; MuHoz et al., 2012). Moreover, oxidation of cytosolic DA triggers NM synthesis as an autophagic cellular stress response (Sulzer et al., 2000). Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it was thus hypothesized that conditions which promote oxidative stress via high cytosolic DA (Mosharov et al., 2009) may account for the selectivity of neuronal MHC-I expression by catecholamine neurons . To enhance cytosolic DA, the DA precursor, L-DOPA, was used, which is accumulated by amino acid transport and converted into DA in the cytosol. Exposure to high levels of L-DOPA can produce NM in both catecholaminergic and nominally non-catecholaminergic cells (Sulzer et al., 2000). L-DOPA is used therapeutically in PD treatment, and while there is no clear evidence indicating that L-DOPA is toxic in humans including PD patients, the compound can be toxic to cultured cells (Pardo et al., 1995; Mosharov et al., 2009). SN murine neuronal cultures were exposed to L-DOPA under conditions that substantially increase cytosolic DA as measured by intracellular patch electrochemistry (Mosharov et al . , 2009) and promote NM production as observed by brightfield microscopy (Sulzer et al., 2000) . Control SN neurons exhibited no visible NM, while the addition of L-DOPA induced NM in 40% of the neurons {FIG. 4A and 4B) , confirming the formation of non-degradable oxidized catecholamine products within autophagic organelles (Sulzer et al., 2000) . In these experiments L-DOPA was found to stimulate neuronal MHC-I display in -10% of TH+ neurons and -7% of TH- neurons (FIG. 4C) . Altogether, the data herein indicate that high levels of neuronal DA can induce the formation of pigmented NM organelles and the presentation of neuronal MHC-I even in the absence of microglia or exogenously added IFN-γ. This suggests that redox stress in neuronal cytosol due to cytosolic catecholamines could underlie the particular expression of MHC-I by catecholamine neurons. This is also consistent with the observation that TH- neurons can display MHC-I when treated with L-DOPA, which induces accumulation of catechols in cytosol followed by their subsequent oxidation. L-DOPA exposure in patients is noted to be substantially lower than in the culture system, and may not be sufficient to enhance oxidation or MHC-I display, but the findings herein suggest that a history of cytosolic catecholamine could provide a signal leading to the MHC-I display specific to catecholamine neurons in adult human. Example 6. SN neurons are antigen presenting cells A characteristic of "professional" antigen cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) is their capacity to process and load antigen onto the MHC-I groove. Although previous in vitro studies show hippocampal neurons display MHC-I upon exposure to IFN-yand present small peptides exogenously added to the culture (Medana et al., 2000; Meuth et al., 2009), there are to our knowledge no reports examining whether neurons can internalize, process and load antigens onto the MHC-I as other cells do. To examine antigen presentation by cultured neurons, 1) all sources of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were removed from the media, and 2) VM neuronal cultures were exposed to chicken OVA. OVA is a 385 amino acid foreign protein {Nisbet et al., 1981) that can be cleaved to an 8 amino acid SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) peptide by DCs and other "professional" antigen presenting cells; the SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) peptide is then loaded and presented in their MHC-I groove (Falk et al. , 1993) . Following exposure of SN neuronal cultures to OVA or vehicle for 7 days, neurons were exposed to IFN-yor saline for 72 h (note that these cultures were never exposed to SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) ) . The cultures were then double immunolabeled for TH and an antibody that recognizes only the MHC-I complex when is occupied by SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) (SIINFEKL-MHC-I) . Occasional label of astrocytes, but not neurons, for SIINFEKL-MHC-I was observed when the cultures were exposed to the vehicle, IFN-γ, or OVA alone (FIG. 5A) . In contrast, -10% of TH+ neurons exposed to both OVA and IFN-ywere immunolabeled for SIINFEKL-MHC-I ( P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA; FIG. 5A) , which was present throughout the cytoplasm, indicating that SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) was loaded onto MHC-I within the neuron. In contrast, when cultures were exposed to IFN~7with extracellular SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) as a positive control, -70% of TH+ neurons exhibited SIINFEKL-MHC-I immunolabel selectively on the plasma membrane and not in the cytosol ( P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, FIG. 5A,B). The results herein indicate that OVA had been processed to SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) within these mixed neuron/astrocyte cultures and loaded into the MHC-I groove within neuronal cytosol, and that the resulting complex was presented on the neuronal plasma membrane. Example 7, VM 14 neuronal killing by CTLs As mentioned above, MHC-I display by CNS neurons has to date mostly been implicated in synaptic plasticity (Huh et al., 2000; Oliveira et al., 2004; Goddard et al., 2007; Corriveau et al., 1998; Shatz, 2009; Needleman et al., 2010; Glynn et al., 2011; Elmer and McAllister, 2012) . The capacity of CTLs to respond to MHC-I induced SN neurons was examined first, by following CTL proliferation using 5-bromo-2- deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. The induction of CTL proliferation by DCs and VM neuronal cultures was compared using OT- 1 CTL cells that constitutively recognize and respond to SIINFE L (SEQ ID NO: 9) (Budhu et al . , 2010), and it was found that the combination of IFN-γ and SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) induced similar CTL proliferation by both DC and VM neuronal cultures (FIG. 9D) . In contrast, no neuronally induced proliferation of another clonal CD4+ T cell line that specifically recognizes MHC-II was observed. These results led to the examination of whether neuronal antigen- loaded MHC-I was competent to trigger CTL mediated cell death. The OT-1 CTL line was used as effector cells and SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) peptide-pulsed SN neurons were used as the target cells . The combination of CTLs, IFN-γ, and SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) killed 55% of TH+ neurons; as expected, no neuronal death was triggered in similarly treated cultures of MHC-I null (knockout: KO) SN neurons (FIG. 6A) . The presence of CTLs was required to elicit neuronal death, as medium conditioned by SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) -activated CTLs but with the CTLs themselves omitted, did not kill neurons (FIG. 9Ξ) . To determine whether the astrocyte monolayer played a role in the CTL-mediated neuronal death, cultures in which wild type or KO astrocytes were plated under wild-type ventral midbrain neurons, were compared. MHC-I was induced by IFN-γ, and then SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) and OT-1 cells were added to the culture. Different levels of neuronal death between neurons plated on wild type astrocytes or KO astrocytes was not observed, indicating that the ability of astrocytes in culture to express MHC-I is irrelevant to OT-1 mediated neuronal death (FIG. 9F) . The mechanism of induced neuronal death by CTLs was then explored. The Fas/Fas ligand antagonist, Kp7-6, the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD- FMK, and the perforin/granzyme antagonist, concanamycin A, each were found to protect against CTL mediated neuronal death, and that the combination of Kp7-6 and concanamycin A was found to completely block neuronal death (FIG. 6B) . These results indicate that both Fas/Fas ligand and perforin/granzyme pathways play a role in SN neuron CTL-mediated death. Finally, as predicted from MHC-I induction by activated microglia (FIG. 3D), the combination of SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9), CTLs and medium conditioned by microglia exposed to LPS, oi-syn, or NM caused extensive neuronal death (FIG. 6C) . Thus, SN neuronal MHC-I can be triggered by secretion of IFN-γ from microglia activated by proinflammatory compounds, or two substances, NM and α-syn, present in the extracellular milieu of the SN in PD. Example 8. Materials and Methods for Examples 1-7 Tissue obtaining and handling This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of: the Institute of Biomedical Technologies - National Research Council of Italy (Segrate, Milano, Italy) , the New York Brain Bank (Columbia University) and the Center for Neurologic Diseases (Harvard Medical School). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Brain samples from 34 normal subjects and 9 PD patients were obtained during autopsy within 5-42 h after death of male and female subjects without evidence of neuropsychiatric and other degenerative disorders. At histological examination, control samples showed no macroscopic neurological, vascular alterations, Lewy bodies or other pathological markers. Tissues from PD subjects were examined histologically by routine staining to confirm loss of SN and LC pigmented neurons, the presence of Lewy bodies and extraneuronal NM. Subjects ages were between 47 and 94 years old, and each PD sample was paired with an age-matched control. Samples from 8 control and 9 PD individuals were used for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence; samples from 1 control subject was used for electron microscopy; samples from 8 control subjects for mass spectrometry; two existing laser-captured microdissected microarray data sets of 17 controls were analyzed for mRNA expression. Each experiment described below was performed at least in triplicate . Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence SN/VTA, LC, hippocampal with adjacent entorhinal cortex, and striatum (caudate) tissues blocks for histology and histochemistry were fixed in 10% formalin (pH 7.2-7.4) and embedded in paraffin (Zecca et al., 2004). Tissue sections were incubated with citric acid at 95 aC for 30 minutes to retrieve antigen and blocked in normal serum; those sections designated for immunohistochemistry were treated with H2O2 to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. Primary antibodies for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were the following: for human MHC-I, we used a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against amino acids 63-362 of the human HLA, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalogue number: sc-55582; this epitope is shared by HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C and so detects all three) , and p2m (mouse monoclonal antibody raised against amino acids 1-120 of the human β2ιπ, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue number: sc- 13565) . A second antibody against human β2πι was used (mouse monoclonal antibody raised against amino acids 1-119 of human β2πι, 1,-100, Abnova, catalogue number: H00000567-M01 ) , that provided the same pattern of staining as the HLA and the original p2m antibodies. For human HC-II: a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against HLA- DR/DP/DQ/DX (CR3/43), 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue number: sc-53302. For TH: rabbit polyclonal, 1:2000, Millipore, catalogue number: AB152. For Fox-3 : rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Abeam, catalogue number: abl04225. For CD8*: rabbit polyclonal, raised against a synthetic peptide sequence comprising the 13 C-terminal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of a-chain of the CD8 molecule, 1:50, ThermoScientific , catalogue number: RB-9009-P1. Preliminary control experiments in which the primary antibodies were omitted or HLA (A, B and C) and β2κι antibodies were pre-absorbed with the corresponding neutralizing peptide (293T cell lysate transfected with the sequence corresponding to the HLA epitope shared by HLA A, B and C and human full-length β2πι peptide respectively), were performed in order to confirm the specificity of the primary antibodies (FIG. 10A) . The HLA (A, B and C) and β2πι primary antibodies produced a pattern of label similar to well established MHC-I* structures in human. The immunolabel of blood vessels within the same sections was used as an internal positive control to confirm that the labeling techniques were successful. As the pre-adsorption control does not prove that the monoclonal antibody does not bind another protein, but rather that it binds to the protein of interest, additional controls for HLA and β2πι primary antibodies were carried out. From one control brain, the SN of the opposite hemisphere that was processed for immunostaining was homogenated for western blots. Both antibodies produced a single, clear band that matched with the appropriate molecular weight (46 KDa for HLA and 12 KDa for β2Γη, see FIG. 10 B, C) . As an additional control for CD8* antibody, human spleen (paraffin sections obtained from Cell Marque) was used to test specificity of this antibody, as well as absence of labeling when omitting the primary antibody (FIG. 10 D) . Sections designated for immunohistochemistry were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200, VectorLabs) followed by avidin-biotin complex (VectorLabs); V-VIP was used as the chromogen (VectorLabs) . Sections designated for immunofluorescence were incubated with secondary fluorescent antibodies (Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-594, 1:400, Invitrogen) and mounted with a water-based medium. Images were captured with a Leica SP5 microscope. There was no fluorescence bleedthrough of secondary antibodies under the conditions used. Counting of NM*, TH* and HLA* neurons was performed in three sections per patient (n = 8 or 9 patients per condition) using a fluorescent microscope at 20X magnification. Quantification was based on the absolute presence of HLA and rated as positive or negative. Electron microscopy Immunoelectron microscopy experiments were carried out on tissue blocks fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde /0.25 % glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.12 M, pH 7.4) and embedded in LRW resin. Ultrathin sections were incubated with an HLA (A, B and C) antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and then with a gold particle (15 nm) -conjugated secondary antibody (1:100, British Biocell International) . Micrographs were acquired by a transmission electron microscope LEO 912 (Advanced Light and Electron Microscopy Biolmaging Center - San Raffaele Scientific Institute) . Mass spectrometry MHC-I peptides were identified by mass spectrometry in NM pigment isolated from SN, organelles containing NM, and NM separated from organelles obtained as reported (Zecca et al., 2008). Digested peptides were separated by two-dimensional micro-liquid chromatography coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (2DC-MS/MS) . The SEQUEST database search algorithm was used to match experimental spectra to peptide sequences in the database. Peptide search was executed against an updated non-redundant human protein sequence database and MHC-I isoform (HLA gene) database from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Laser capture microdissection and bioinformatics analysis Affymetrix CEL files for the National Brain Databank data set (NBD) were normalized to "all probe sets" using standard procedures, and scaled to 100 by the MAS5 algorithm implemented in the Bioconductor package (Zheng et al . , 2008; Gentleman et al., 2004). Laser-capture microdissection and microarray methods used to generate the NBD data set are described (Simunovic et al., 2009). Western blotting Tissue for western blotting was obtained from the New York Brain Bank frozen, and then rapidly homogenated at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 50 mM of Tris-HCl, 150 mM of NaCl, 5 * of EDTA and 1% of Triton-Tx. Protein concentration of the total homogenate was measured using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) . 60 μg of protein per lane were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel for HLA antibody and on a 15% polyacrylamide gel for β2πι antibody. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) . After blocking in 5 % dry milk, primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C, then rinsed 3 times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Fisher Scientific). Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at RT, blots rinsed in Tris-buffered saline-Tween as before, developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Immobilon HRP substrate reagents, Millipore) , and then exposed to film (Crystalgen) . HLA (1:100, from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and β2κι (1:100, from Abnova) primary antibodies were used. Actin (1:500,000, from Sigma Aldrich) primary antibody was used as a loading control . hES derived DA neuronal cultures hES derived DA neuronal cultures were obtained as described (Kriks et al., 2011). Briefly, H9 human ES cells were subjected to dual SMAD-inhibition followed by exposure to sonic hedgehog, purmorphamine, FGF8 and CHIR99021. Neurons were passaged on day 20, replated on glass-bottom dishes on day 30 at a density of 200.000 cells per 20 μΐ droplet, and then matured in Neurobasal media with the addition of B27 supplement, GDNF, BDNF, ascorbic acid, cAMP, TGFbeta and DAPT. hES derived spinal motor neuron (MN) cultures expressing EYFP under control of the human synapsin promoter were generated by exposure to dual SMAD-inhibition followed by caudalization with retinoid acid and ventralization through the hedgehog pathway. MN aggregates were replated on day 20 and matured in Neurobasal media with the addition of B27 supplement, GDNF, BDNF, ascorbic acid, cAMP and DAPT. Cultures were treated with human IFN-γ (eBioscience) at a non-toxic concentration for hES (100 ng/ml, 72h) . Cultures were then incubated with the MHC-I antibody prior to fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and double immunofluorescence for TH and MHC-I as above. Micrographs were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5-II inverted confocal microscope. Mice Animal protocols were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals guidelines. Mouse lines including wild type C57BL/6, OT-1, OT-2 and B6.129P2-B2mtmlUnc/J mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and had access to food and water ad libitum. Each experiment described below was performed at least in triplicate. Primary cultures Primary cultures of microglial cells, SN, VTA, VM (including SN and VTA), LC, cortical, striatal and thalamic neurons were derived from brains of newborn C57/B16 or B6.129P2-B2mtmiUnc/J mice (0-3 days, either sex) (Sulzer et al., 2008). B6.129P2-B2mtmlt¾":/J mice were generated by a targeted disruption of the gene, and have little or no MHC-I protein expression on the cell surface68. Briefly, for microglial cultures cells dissociated from 5 cortexes of 0-3 days old C57/B16 mice were seeded onto 75 cm2 cell culture flasks in microglial culture medium (MEM supplemented with calf serum, glucose 45%, penicillin/streptomycin, insulin (25 mg/ml) and 200 mM glutamine) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C (Sulzer et al., 2008). Two weeks later, microglia were detached from flasks by mild shaking and plated on 12 well-plates at a density of 45,000-50,000 microglial cells/well. For neuronal cultures, the area of interest was dissected and neurons were dissociated and plated at a density of 80,000/cm2 onto a layer of rat cortical glial cells grown on round glass coverslips and maintained in culture medium without added GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 5-9 days) (Sulzer et al., 2008). Primary DCs were obtained from mouse (either sex) femur hematopoietic stem cells. In brief, mouse femur hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow were harvested from the hind legs of 8 to 12- week old male wild-type C57BL/6J and plated at 2 x 106 cells/ml density in DC culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, lx non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 20 mM HEPES) . For differentiation to dendritic cells, 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse GM-CSF was added to media. Cells were fed every 2 days with fresh DMEM containing GM-CSF, and the cultures were trypsinized after 8 days and plated at 4 x 105 cells/cm2 density to be used for experiments the following day (Talloczy et al . , 2008). OT-l CD8* and OT-2 CD4* T cell lines, a kind gift from Dr. Raphael Clynes (Department of Medicine and Microbiology, Columbia University Medical Center) , express a transgene encoding T cell receptor that specifically recognizes SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) peptide (derived from OVA) bound to MHC-I H-2Kb or to MHC-II I-A/I-E (Hogquist et al . , 1994). Activated primary OT-l and OT-2 T cells were generated by the addition of SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) to the cultures (Harris et al., 2012). Briefly, 0T-1/OT-2 mouse spleens were dissected and homogenized, the released cells were pelleted and resuspended in 5 ml AC buffer (0.15 M NH4C1, 1 mM KHC03, and 0.1 mM EDTA) for 1 min to lyse red blood cells, and the splenocytes were pelleted, washed, resuspended at 5 x 106 cells/ml in OT-l growth medium containing 0.75 ug/ml SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) peptide, and incubated at 37°C in a 95% air/5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. On days 3 and 5, 25 ml of fresh OT-l/OT-2 growth medium containing 10 U/ml of mouse recombinant IL-2 was added to the cultures. On day 7, the cells were harvested and OT-l/OT-2 cells were purified by centrifugation at 400 g for 30 min at room temperature over a Histopaque gradient (density = 1.083) (Budhu et al., 2010). Cellular treatments IFN-γ (R&D Systems) was used at a range of non-toxic concentrations for neurons or OT-l cells (10 pg/ml-100 ng/ml, 72h) . 12-well cell culture plates were pre-treated with LPS (500 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) , NM (5pg/ml) , ot-syn, Nit-a-syn or Mut- -syn (200 ug/ml, kindly provided by Peter Lansbury, Harvard University) for 72h before plating 45,000-50,000 microglial cells/well for an additional 24h. A neutralizing IFN-γ antibody (1:500, PBL InterferonSource) was used to block IFN-γ released from microglia. VM neurons were incubated for 72h with microglial medium pre-stimulated by LPS, NM, oi-syn, Nit-a-syn or Mut-a-syn. As a control experiment, we directly incubated VM neurons with the same compounds in the absence of microglia. In another set of experiments, VM, cortical and striatal primary neurons were incubated for 72h with microglial medium pre- stimulated by LPS, NM, a-syn. NM was induced in SN cultured neurons by using L-DOPA (Sulzer et al., 2000) (Sigma Aldrich) . For foreign protein processing and subsequent antigen presentation, VM cultures were maintained for 7 days in either 1) BSA/serum-free neuronal medium, 2) BSA/serum-f ee supplemented with OVA (2.5 mg/ml) , adding IFN-7 (100 ng/ml) or saline for an additional 72h.. ELISA The concentration of IFN-γ released by microglia (plated as above) was measured by an ELISA kit (eBioscience) that detected the amount of this proinflammatory cytokine in a range of 0.7-100 pg/ml. Immunofluorescence Cell cultures were double-labeled for MHC-I using a specific antibody raised against the H-2Kb and Η-2ΰ> class I alloantigens (mouse monoclonal, 1:100, BD Biosciences, catalogue number: 553575), MHC-II (by using an mouse monoclonal antibody that reacts with a polymorphic determinant shared by the I-A[b] , I-A[d] , I-A[q], I- E[d], and I-E[k] MHC-II alloantigens, 1:100, BD Biosciences, catalogue number: 556999) or SIINFEKL-MHC-I (mouse monoclonal, 1:100, eBioscience, catalogue number 14-5743-81) and TH (rabbit polyclonal, 1:2000, Millipore, catalogue number: AB152) or MAP-2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, Millipore, catalogue number: AB5622), fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) , blocked with normal serum (Jackson Immunoresearch) and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor-594 or Alexa Fluor-488, 1:400, Invitrogen) . Images were captured using a Leica SP5 microscope system. There was no fluorescence bleed-through of secondary antibodies under the conditions used. MHC-I label observed in the neuronal cultures obtained from wild type mice was absent in neurons from |J2m KO mice (FIG. 3A) . In order to assess the proportion of TH* and MAP-2* neurons that expressed MHC-I* , first TH* and MAP-2* neurons were counted in 24 fields surrounding the border of the well at 20X magnification. The number of TH* or MAP-2* neurons with intact soma and two or more neurites equal to or greater than the diameter of the cell soma was counted. Then, the fluorescent filter was inserted for each field to determine how many of these neurons also expressed MHC-I. To further analyze the specificity of the MHC-I antibody, a western blot was run of wild type versus p2m KO brain tissue (see western blot paragraph below for detailed method) . A single band (-30 KDa) was observed in lanes loaded with brain tissue from wild type mice, whereas there were no visible bands in the lanes that contained brain tissue from β2πι KO. A positive control (mouse spleen homogenate) displayed a band at the same molecular weight (FIG. 10E) . Western blotting The brains of 3 C57/BL6 and 3 B6.129P2-B2mc™10n/J were dissected on ice and then rapidly homogenated at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 50 mM of Tris-HCl, 150 mM of NaCl, 5 mM of EDTA and 1% of Triton-Tx. Protein concentration of the total homogenate was measured using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) . 20 μg of protein per lane were run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) . After blocking in 5 % dry milk, primary antibody (MHC-I antibody raised against the H-2Kb and H-2Db class I alloantigens , mouse monoclonal, 1:100, BD Biosciences), was applied overnight at 4 °C, then rinsed 3 times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Fisher Scientific) . Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at RT, blots rinsed in Tris-buffered saline-tween as before, developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Immobilon HRP substrate reagents, Millipore), and then exposed to film (Crystalgen) . Actin (1:500,000, from Sigma Aldrich) primary antibody was used as a loading control. 20 g of mouse spleen homogenate was loaded as a positive control for the MHC-I antibody. Proliferation and killing assays OT-1 CD8* cell proliferation was assessed by BrdU incorporation. For OT-1 T cell cytotoxicity assays, DC and VM (from C57BL/6 and B6.129P2-B2mtmlUnc/J mice) cell cultures were incubated with neuronal medium or neuronal medium containing 100 ng/ml of IFN-γ (R&D Systems) . Neurons were loaded with or without SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9) peptide (1 uM) , and, subsequently in vitro activated OT-1 cells were added at a density of 100,000 cells/well and co-incubated for 24 h. We used the same conditions for VM cell cultures with microglial medium previously stimulated with LPS, NM or a-syn instead of IFN-γ. Neurons were pre-incubated with IFN-γ and SIINFE L (SEQ ID NO: 9) peptide as above, and then with: 1) a pan-caspase general inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK, 20 uM, 24h, IMGENEX) ; 2) a specific granzyme/perforin inhibitor (concanamycin A, 100 nM, 24h, Sigma Aldrich) ; 3) a specific Fas/FasL antagonist (Kp7-6, lmM, 24h, EMD Biosciences) and 4) concanamycin A and Kp7-6 together. OT-1 cells were then added to the culture (100,000 cells/well) and maintained for 24 h. Following immunocytochemical staining of VM neurons, we assessed the proportion of surviving DA (TH*) and non-DA cells (MAP-2+, TH-) . Total numbers of TH* and MAP-2* neurons were counted in 24 fields surrounding the border of the well at 20X magnification. The number of surviving TH* neurons with an intact soma and two or more neurites equal to or greater than the diameter of the cell soma was counted and normalized to the number in untreated cultures. Statistics Results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) . Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times, and each condition was also examined in three subjects or cultures within each experiment. Two-way AOVA was used to analyze the IFN-γ dose- response experiments. Two-tailed Student's T-test (or Man Whitney U test for non-parametric cases) or one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc tests were used to analyze the other experiments. Example 9. Cytokine Release la Controls and FD Patients Blood from age matched controls and PD patients were obtained and mononuclear cells were isolated by gradient centrifugation. Release of the cytokines gamma-interferon, which measures activation of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells, and the interleukin, IL-5, which measures activation of CD4+ T cells was measured by ELISpot assay. Briefly, the isolated cells were plated in wells that have colorimetric detection of gamma-interferon and IL-5, and were stimulated with pools of 95 epitopes of a-synuclein that the Sette lab determined would potentially be displayed by MHC-I or MHC-II antigen-presenting proteins in humans. After 22 hours of stimulation at 37 C, the cells were removed and release of cytokines was measured by colorimetric detection of spot-forming cells (SFC) . Confirmed release of cytokine is determined by the presence of a minimum of 20 SFC per million cells. Cytokine release was detected in only 15 of 160 stimulations to a- synuclein epitopes across controls (n=12) , while 43 of 248 stimulations in PD patients had antigenic responses, yielding a probability of p =0.029 that PD patients are a different population (two-tailed Fisher exact test) . Thus, the data shows that PD patients are more likely to have T cells in blood that recognize and are activated by a-synuclein than unaffected individuals.

Tolerization therapy specific for epitopes of ct-syn neuromelanin, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LKRK2) and glococerebrosidase is useful in treating subjects afflicted with PD. Epitopes to which T cells are responsive in subjects afflicted with PD are identified by i) obtaining T cells from each subject; ii> contacting the T cells with a test compound; iii) determining whether the T cells have increased activation after contact with the test compound; and iv) identifying the test compound as an epitope to which the T cells are responsive if in step iii) the T cells are determined to have increased activation after contact with the test compound, and identifying the test compound as not an epitope to which the T cells are responsive if in step iii) the T cells are determined to not have increased activation after contact with the test compound. This method is repeated sequentially or in parallel for thousands of test compounds, each having an amino acid sequence identical to a stretch of consecutive amino acids in the a-syn, LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase proteins, or being identical to a portion of neuromelanin. Epitopes for ot-syn, neuromelanin, LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase are identified in individual subjects. The subjects afflicted with PD are then separated into one of two groups: 1) a test group that receives tolerization therapy, or 2) a control group that does not receive tolerization therapy. Within the test group, an effective amount of an a-syn, neuromelanin, LRRK2 or glucocerebrosidase epitope is administered orally, nasally, or subcutaneously to each subject (i.e., tolerization therapy specific for the epitope) . Within the control group, a polypeptide having a random sequence is administered to each subject. Compared to the control group, subjects in the test group have a statistically significant reduction in symptoms of PD. Tremors are reduced and mobility is improved in a statistically significant proportion of the subjects. Additionally, a statistically significant proportion of the subjects have little or no progression of PD. Less or no activation of T cells by the epitope is observed in subjects who receive and respond to tolerization therapy, but not in subjects who do not receive or who do not respond to tolerization therapy . Example 11. Autoimmune Features of Neurodegenerative Disorders SPECIFIC AIMS Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the misprocessing of specific proteins, but how and if this results in cell death has been unknown. This study supports collaborative research between immunology (Sette) and neuroscience (Sulzer) laboratories with disease experts (Alcalay, Marder), to pursue new findings that require such cross-disciplinary collaboration. Joint Results disclosed herein provide the first direct evidence that Parkinson's disease (PD) , which has long been known to feature prominent neuroinflammatory components, is for at least many patients in part an autoimmune disorder that features antigen presentation and specific T cell responses. The results demonstrate that PD shares fundamental features with classical autoimmune disorders including Type-1 diabetes (T1D) , multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. This new direction stems in part from a recent report of antigen presentation by substantia nigra (SN) dopamine and locus coeruleus norepinephrine neurons in adult human brain, and the accompanying demonstration of T cell mediated death in primary neuronal culture (Cebrian et al., 2014c). While indicating that the most targeted neurons in PD can present antigen, that study did not identify specific antigens. The Results disclosed herein now identify two disease-associated neoantigens (autoimmune self epitopes) that are expressed by human blood donors that are derived from alpha- synuclein (oi-syn) , a protein well established to be misprocessed in PD. These epitopes were found in 21 of 44 PD patients and comparatively little in age matched controls without neurodegenerative disease (p < 0.01 patients versus controls). The -syn epitopes are in two regions, one close to the pathogenic mutations that cause PD, and the other at a residue highly phosphorylated in PD. Two common HLA-DR alleles were identified in the patients with high binding affinity to these antigens; these alleles have been independently associated with PD by genome-wide association (GWAS) linkage studies, and so this process is a candidate for explaining at least forms of PD associated with these HLA-DR alleles. Finally, the Standaert group recently published that SN neuronal death in a viral a-syn overexpression model is absent in MHC-II null mice. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, the overall hypothesis in this study is that PD is associated with self-derived neoantigens that becomes increasingly expressed in aging or disease conditions . The overall aim in this study is to identify the antigenic responses associated with PD and Lewy Body disease (LBD) . oi-syn-derived neoantigens are identified in these patients and these profiles are compared in patients with additional Lewy Body dementia (LBD) as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a control protein, phosphorylated-tau will be examined, which undergoes similar means of autophagic degradation to a-syn and is a PD rise factor. This study 1) identifies epitopes that act as neoantigens in PD, AD, and LBD; 2) characterizes the responsive T cells; and 3) characterizes the role of antigen presentation and T cell-mediated neuronal death by animal models that express an HLA allele implicated in PD with high affinity to an a-syn epitope. The autoimmune features are confirmed, and therapies are used to treat other autoimmune disorders such as tolerization are used to treat PD. Aim 1. Identify antigenic proteins and epitopes in PD, LBD, and AD. Hypothesis: Epitopes derived from native and modified a-syn and possibly tau protein in PD, AD, and LBD are recognized as neoantigens by patient T cells. Plan: Blood from patients and aged matched controls is examinedto quantify the T cells that are responsive to potential neoantigens, particularly following phosphorylation, using in vitro assays. Epitopes, HLA restriction and cytokine profiles are defined for responsive patients. Specific epitope-HLA combinations are identified in patient populations. Aim 2. Characterize the HLA alleles the epitopes and responsive T cells in PD, LBD, and AC. Hypothesis: T cells responsive to neoantigens in neurodegenerative disorders encompass memory T cell subsets that have undergone clonal expansion during pathogenesis. Plan: Subsets of responsive T cells from patients are identified and phenotyped by cytokine profiling and by using tetramers of specific HLA alleles and epitopes determined in Aim 1. This provides a means for diagnosis of subtypes of these disorders and potential biomarkers. Aim 3. Determine the role of HLA restricted alpha-synudein antigen presentation in a PD mouse model. Hypothesis: Overexpression of a-syn in DA neurons of the SN drives neuronal MHC and antigen expression, leading to T cell-mediated replication and neuronal death. Plan: A viral a-syn overexpression model (rAAV2-SYN) is adapted to humanized mutant mice that express HLA of high and low affinity for α-syn epitopes. This study examines MHC and cytokine expression, T cell infiltration to brain, PD model behaviors, alterations in DA neurotransmission, and SN neuronal death, which may be absent in MHC null mice and reinstated with human MHC alleles associated with PD and a-syn. Research Strategy (A) SIGNIFICANCE The causes of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurodegenerative disorders including Lewy Body dementia (LBD) and Alzheimer's (AD) remain unknown. This study tests the novel hypothesis that PD is in part an autoimmune disorder of the acquired immune system in which T cells recognize proteins such as alpha- synuclein (ot-syn) as neoantigens. This direction was initiated by the recent discovery of antigen presentation by adult human neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) , and that cultured SN neurons induced to express a classical MHC-I presented antigen (the albumin-derived epitope, SIINFEKL) are killed by specific T cells that recognize that epitope (Cebrian et al., 2014c) . A primary neuropathological signature of PD is the presence of highly phosphorylated (at residue S129) a-syn aggregates known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in surviving SN DA neurons. Lewy inclusions are also prominent in cortical neurons in LBD (Spillantini et al., 1998b; Spillantini et al . , 1998a). Notably, in the synucleinopathies , PD with dementia (PDD) , which is observed in a majority of long-term PD patients, and LBD, also feature aggregates of phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau) , inclusions that are highly prominent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Arnold et al., 2013). Classical autoimmune disorders such as Type-1 diabetes (T1D) are thought to result from an analogous misprocessing of self proteins to produce "neoantigens", epitopes presented by major histocompatibility (MHC) proteins (Marrack and appler, 2012). These are often thought to have escaped self-recognition during thymic selection (Yin et al., 2013). Not only is the thymus lost during the third decade, but lysosomal degradation including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is less efficient with age (Cuervo and Macian, 2014), as apparent from the non-degraded lipofuscin or "aging pigment" and neuromelanin that accumulates in neurons of the SN and 5 LC neurons that are most highly targeted in PD (Sulzer et al . , 2008) . A relevant finding from collaborations with the Cuervo laboratory is that the mutant forms of a-syn (A53T and A30P) and dopa ine-modified a-syn both block CMA (Cuervo et al . , 2004; Martinez-Vicente et al., 2008), while phosphporylated α-syn is not 10 broken down by CMA (Martinez-Vicente et al., 2008). Thus, the appearance of novel breakdown products of α-syn during disease is expected, and could provide a source of neoantigens that could lead to PD. 15 As shown in the Results, neoantigens (Armstrong et al., 2014; Hall et al., 2014) derived from a-syn are found to be present in about 50% of cases of PD. Reports by others indicate that CD8* and "helper" (CD4*) T cells are present at far higher than normal levels in the SN of PD brains than control subjects (Brochard et al., 20 2009) . If antigens specific to PD were presented by these neurons in patients and responsive T cells were present, the neurons may be killed by immunological processes . It is further found that a-syn provides two specific regions 25 containing neoantigenic epitopes in -50% of PD patients. Both epitopes feature a region of the protein modified by phosphorylation. The first, Y39, is present in both controls and PD patients (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2014). The second, S129, exhibits much higher phosphorylation in PD (Foulds et al . , 2013). Tau, which 30 is implicated as a PD gene (Sharma et al., 2012), also a CMA substrate (Wang et al., 2009), highly phosphorylated in multiple disorders (PDD, LBD, AD) , and produces aggregates that can overlap with Lewy aggregates particularly in PDD and LBD, is also a possible additional candidate neoantigen. 35 The identification of PD autoimmune features offers important implications including: 1. Therapeutic approaches being studied for classical autoimmune disorders such as tolerization therapy may be adopted for treatment . 2. Genetic PD models generally do not exhibit SN and LC neuronal death (Chesselet, 2008) , perhaps as immune features are generally missing (Harms et al., 2013; Cebrian et al., 2014b), and so improved animal models could be developed. 3. Explanations for linkage between specific HLA genes and PD in GWAS studies would be explained (Lampe et al., 2003; Hamza et al., 2010; Hill-Burns et al., 2011; Ahmed et al., 2012; Wissemann et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013). 4. Screening for T cell response could provide a means for preclinical identification or a biomarker. 5. Insight may be provided on how a-syn pathology apparently "spreads" through the nervous system (Luk and Lee, 2014) , particularly from the periphery (Shannon et al . , 2012) where T cells replicate. 6. After age 50, the incidence of PD in identical and fraternal twins is identical (Tanner et al., 1999), and monogenic causes of the disease represent only a small fraction of the patients: this "sporadic" nature of PD might be explained by T cell receptors, which differ even in identical twins. (B) INNOVATION The project is to our knowledge the first to explore if proteins involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders produce neoantigens. This impetus is derived from a) our new study (Cebrian et al . , 2014c) reporting that SN and LC neurons of adult humans, the major targeted neurons in PD, display the antigen presenting protein, MHC-I, a first demonstration of antigen presentation by adult human neurons, b) Results demonstrating that PD patients selectively possess T cells that recognize a-syn as a foreign protein, c) A study from David Standaert's laboratory showing that mice deficient for MHC-II are protected from a viral model of a-syn neurodegeneration (Harms et al., 2013). This project clearly requires collaborative expertise in neuroscience, immunology and the clinic, and the gathering together of these skills has enabled this new direction. Together, a new insight is introduced, that PD is at least in part an autoimmune disease. This may be extended to LBD, which is also a synucelinopathy that features both phosorylated a-syn and phosphorylated tau aggregates, and AD which has high levels of tau aggregates but for which a-syn aggregates are also prominent in some individuals. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it is suggested, in analogy to T1D, that with disease processes, some individuals develop protein modifications, such as phosphorylated and dopamine-modifled a-syn in PD or highly phosphorylated tau in AD, and that epitopes derived from the modified proteins are recognized as foreign. It is found that oc-syn, while a "self protein", may play a role similar to proinsulin or glutamic acid decarboxylase-derived neoantigens in T1D that lead to T cell mediated death of islet insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas (Roep and Peakman, 2012; Marrack and Kappler, 2012), or loss of oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis (Mars et al., 2012). This study and the present invention provides biomarkers, diagnostic and new therapeutic directions for treatment of PD. (C) APPROACH The acquired immune system and autoimmune disorders. The concept of "neoantigens", proteins that may undergo modification or disrupted normal degradation and become a source for novel antigenic epitopes, was developed from studies of autoimmune disease (Marrack and Kappler, 2012). For example, in T1D, the insulin precursor or glutamic acid decarboxlyase enzyme is often presented as an antigen and mis-recognized as a foreign invader, so that the pancreatic beta cells are identified and killed by T cells. Other examples of classical T cell related autoimmune disorders are multiple sclerosis, in which glial cells are destroyed by T cells that mistake myelin protein as foreign (Traugott, 1987), lupus erythematosus (Sawla et al., 2012) and psoriatic arthritis (Diani et al., 2014). Particular MHC alleles are associated with particular neoantigen epitopes in these diseases: e.g., the HLA-DQ alleles DQA1*03:01/DQB1*03:02 are highly associated with T1D and present glutamic acid decarboxylase residues 121-140 and 250-266 (Chow et al. , 2014) . The thymus participates in identifying proteins as self or non-self, but disappears in early adulthood. Thymus-derived T cells display an extremely high number of clones, each with different T cell receptors (TCR) on their surface. Millions of different TCRs are present in each individual; this is accomplished through a process of genetic recombination during development similar to antibody production by B cells. Within the thymus, the different T cells are "negatively selected" and deleted if they react with epitopes of intrinsic proteins, which protects against autoimmune response, and "positively selected' if they appropriately recognize foreign epitopes. In classical autoimmune disorders such as T1D, there are errors in this process, leading to identification of self-proteins, e.g., peptides derived from pre-proinsulin, as foreign even in young people (Marrack and Kappler, 2012; Roep and Peakman, 2012). T cell types include "killer" cytotoxic CD8* T cells and "helper" CD4* T cells. The latter encompass subtypes involved in regulating immune responses, such as "T cells, and others that stimulate the acquired immune system, including recognition of "non-self" proteins that can stimulate killer T cells or antibody-producing B cells . Specific T cell clones, some of which are maintained after antigen exposure in low levels as "memory" T cells, are activated by particular MHC/epitope combinations, leading to cytokine release, clonal expansion, and acquired immune responses. A technology of specific HLA-epitope recombinant protein combinations known as "tetramers" is used to count the number of a particular T cell clone that participates in allergic reaction or autoimmune response (Kurtulus and Hildeman, 2013) . The activation of T cells requires the presentation of a peptide epitope by the heterodimeric MHC molecule expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells. The inventors have shown this occurs in the specific neurons that are the most prone to neurodegeneration in PD (Cebrian et al., 2014c), a surprise to the field as it had been thought that mature neurons did not exhibit antigen. The HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genes that encode human MHC proteins are located in a region of chromosome 6. The HLA-A, B, and C genes encode alpha subunits of the dimer MHC-I that contain a groove that binds peptides, with an invariant beta microglobulin chain: there are thus typically 6 MHC-I alleles in human with heterozygous alleles. MHC-II binding of peptides is by products of the HLA-D genes, which are duplicated variously in the human population with as many as 6 alpha change genes and 6 beta chain genes, providing larger and variable numbers of MHC-II proteins in an individual (Cano et al., 2007). MHC-I molecules are size restricted due to barriers on the edge of the groove and display peptides of 8-11 amino acids, and activate so-called cytotoxic or killer CD8* T cells. MHC-II have a longer groove without barriers, and so binds peptide regions of ~>15 amino acids, activating so-called helper CD4* T cells. Individual HLA genes encompass a tremendous number of alleles, e.g., there are over 2,880 alleles in the human population for HLA-A, providing a broad range of response to infection between individuals. The binding of particular epitopes to the range of MHC are due to differences in amino acid residues in the alpha- (MHC-I) or beta-chain (MHC-II) binding grooves, and so different epitopes are "restricted" for presentation to different alleles. The presented epitope can be from an exogenous peptide loaded into the cell, which is known as "cross presentation" (Bevan, 2006) . An additional basis for this idea was suggested by studies showing that pathologically modified proteins block normal degradation, starting with dopamine-modified cx-syn (Martinez-Vicente et al., 2008), which blocks the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway that appears to normally degrade cx-syn (Cuervo et al., 2004) and tau (Wang et al . , 2009). Studies by a long-term collaborator, Ana Maria Cuervo (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) have shown that CMA substrates can be shunted to an endosomal/lysosomal pathway known as endosomal-microautophagy in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Sahu et al . , 2011). These organelles normally load antigen onto MHC-II molecules (Strawbridge and Blum, 2007; Crotzer and Blum, 2008; ten Broeke et al., 2013), and trigger an autoimmune cascade ( arrack and Kappler, 2012) . This shift from CMA to MVB metabolism could explain the basis of the late stage induction of autoimmune response in PD. Neurodegenerative diseases exhibit specific mishandled proteins: Neuropathologists identify disorders on the basis of immunolabel for misfolded proteins. These include AD (tau, APP) , other forms of dementia (TDP-43), and ALS (TDP-43, FUS) . In PD and LBD, the most prominent neuropathological features are the presence of intraneuronal abnormal aggregations of a-syn protein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, particularly in the phosphorylated 129S residue {Spillantini et al., 1997), but phospho-tau aggregates are also present. There are additional postranslational modifications that cause a neoantigenic response, including several already studied for inhibition of CMA (Martinez-Vicente et al., 2008), particularly nitrated Y39 (Danielson et al., 2009) and possibly Y129 (Hodara et al., 2004), and dopamine-modified a-syn, which interacts with aal25- 129 (Norris et al., 2005). Phosphorylated S129 a-syn bound to lysosomes but was not accumulated by CMA, whereas dopamine-modified a-syn bound avidly but not accumulated and further blocked CMA for other peptides. Tau, the protein product of the MAPT gene, in highly phosphorylated aggregates has long been associated with AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSD) and other dementias, but evidence strongly indicates a role in some PD. MAPT has been identified as a risk factor for PD by GWAS (Sharma et al., 2012), but not AD itself. Phospho-tau can also be high in PD and particularly LBD, while phospho-tau is very high in AD, and there is often significant overlap in patient brain pathology between the disorders. There are additional rarer diseases that also feature such overlap, such as PSP and FTDP-17 which are excluded from this study due to the low number of available patients, as well as multiple system atrophy, for which blood donations are problematic due to orthostatic and circulatory symptoms . Phosphorylated candidate epitopes are important for tau, which has -40 potential phosphorylated sites (Sharma et al., 2012; Yin et al., 5 2013), of which 20 phosphorylated sites were identified in AD patients (Duka et al., 2013); 10 phosphorylated sites were identified in PD striata (S202, 235, 262, 356, 396/404, 409, 413, 422 and T205, 212); and seven sites in LBD (S214, 238, 396/404, 422 and T212, 217). Interestingly, in PD there are 3 clusters of 10 phospho-tau (202,205,212; 356, 396, 404; 409, 413, 422). Tau and ct-syn have many parallel features including association with PD by G AS, phosphorylation under disease conditions, presence of protein (Hampel et al., 2010; Foulds et al . , 2013; Zetterberg et al., 15 2013), and autoantibodies in blood (Bartos et al., 2012; Koehler et al., 2013), and similar degradation by CMA that is disturbed by mutation (Wang et al., 2009). They may even form joint oligomers in some patients (Sengupta et al., 2015). It is therefore considered important to characterize and compare the autoimmune features of 20 these two proteins in these overlapping disorders. While there are many hypotheses on how these proteins cause each disease, including from our own group (Petersen et al., 2001; Dauer et al., 2002; Cuervo et al., 2004; Martinez-Vicente et al . , 2008; 25 Mosharov et al . , 2009; Martinez-Vicente et al., 2010; Orenstein et al., 2013), these efforts have not clearly uncovered the mechanisms of cell death. Moreover, in most animal models, demonstration of appropriate targeted neuronal death pathways has not been yet demonstrated. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, 30 it is suggested that this is because multiple "hits" must occur, similar to the idea that multiple genes must be mutated in cancer (Sulzer, 2007). Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it is 35 suggested that neoantigens of diseases of aging arise because protein processing is altered, as is clear from the formation of the protein aggregates. The resulting epitopes of self proteins were not presented during thymic selection, but could be presented years later by specific HLAs. Some combinations of antigenic epitopes and HLA alleles have already been identified in PD, demonstrating an autoimmune feature in these patients. This is important, as PD has been linked by independent GWAS studies to the HLA alleles B*07:02, C*07:02, DRB5*01, DRB1*15:01, DQAl*01:02, and DQB1*06:02 (Wissemann et al., 2013), which comprise a relatively common linked set of HLA proteins . Remarkably, Data independently show that two of these alleles strongly bind α-syn derived epitopes in PD (see below) . Neuronal antigen presentation: As detailed in reviews (Cebrian et al., 2014a, b) and others, studies starting in the 1920s confirmed the presence of high levels of neuroinflamination in PD and AD pathology, although this was essentially limited to microglial cells, with some evidence for "astroglyosis" . Microglial activation from resident brain inflammatory cells and peripheral macrophage and T- lymphocyte infiltration occur in SN of PD patients and animal models of PD (McGeer et al., 1988; McGeer et al., 2003; Brochard et a., 2009) (McGeer et al., 2003; Moehle and West, 2014). Moreover, cytokines including interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-οί) , interleukin 1-beta and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are elevated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients (Mogi et al., 2007; Hirsch and Hunot, 2009). MHC presentation by astrocytes in AD was reported 25 years ago (McGeer et al., 1988; Tooyama et al . , 1990), although this insight remained dormant in the literature . Antigen presentation by adult neurons, however, was discovered only in our recent study. The neurons most targeted in PD, i.e., adult human substantia nigra (SN) dopamine (DA) neurons and locus coeruleus (LC) neurons, present the antigen displaying protein, MHC- I, to date the only neurons in the adult brain identified to do so. This was confirmed by multiple independent techniques, including immunolabel, electron microscopy, proteomics and detection of mRNA. In addition, MHC-I induction was shown in DA neurons derived from human stem cells. CD8+ T cells were occasionally observed in association with the MHC-I DA neurons (Cebrian et al., 2014c). It was found that the combination of activated microglia and/or oxidative stress with neuronal antigen presentation and the presence of the appropriate T cells that recognize the antigen/MHC complex causes neuronal death (Cebrian et al . , 2014c). These findings are the first suggesting that neuronal antigen presentation could play a role in adult neurodegenerative disorders. As detailed in Aims 1 and 2, the activation of T cells to a-syn and possibly tau will be assessed by analyzing blood from patients. Neuronal antigen presentation and its role in neuronal death however, requires testing in animal models (Aim 3) . The overall goal is to identify disease-associated antigens and MHC alleles that present them in neurodegenerative disorders . Influenza and PD. While not a central focus of this study, this work relates to evidence that some neurotropic viruses cause neurological disorders with a substantial delay after infection. Influenza, in particular, has been linked to encephalitis, parkinsonism and PD (Toovey, 2008) , including delayed parkinsonism associated with the 1918 "Spanish flu" epidemic with associated von Economo's encephalitis, widely known via Oliver Sack's book, Awakenings. Some influenza strains are specifically neurotropic for SN DA neurons (Yamada et al., 1996), including neurovirulent influenza A virus (Takahashi et al., 1995; Mori and Kimura, 2000, 2001; Jang et al., 2009a) . The highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus can enter the CNS and induce neuroinflamination, a-syn aggregation and phosphorylation and SN neuronal death (Jang et al., 2009b). These observations further endorse the possibility of an acquired immune response in some cases of parkinsonism. EXPERIMENTAL PLANS Aim 1. Identify antigenic proteins and epitopes, HLA alleles, and responsive T cells in PD and other disorders. Hypothesis; Epitopes derived from a-syn are recognized as neoantigens by PD and LBD patient T cells. Tau, which like a-syn is associated with PD, phosphorylated in affected brain, and degraded via the C A pathway, is a potential candidate for T cell response in PD, LBD and AD and there may be overlap of response. SubAim 1.1. Identify possible antigenic epitopes: Potential class I and II MHC epitopes derived from native a-syn and tau are identified by algorithmic protocols developed by Sette's lab and colleagues (Paul et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014) that are widely used in immunology. Each possible amino acid sequence that can be derived from spanning the entirety of a particular protein, including its pathogenic alleles, is predicted for HLA binding for nearly the entire human population (Paul et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014). The resulting peptides have been shown to successfully predict MHC- peptide binding of >90% of the human population (Calis et al., 2013). Following the analysis of the candidate antigens of a-syn and tau, each peptide with significant binding potential is manufactured. For a-syn, the 122 most antigenic peptides for MHC-I and MHC-II presentation were already synthesized (A and A, San Diego) and tested as below. The same algorithm is used to calculat 150 candidate tau epitopes that are synthesized. As detailed above, modified residues, particularly by phosphorylation, are strong candidates to cause antigenic response. There are multiple such modifications, with the most clearly implicated phosphorylation. a-Syn is highly phosphorylated at S129 in PD compared to control both in the Lewy aggregates in brain and in blood, where levels are -300% higher in patients (Foulds et al., 2013). For a-syn, all 15 mer peptides containing phosphorylated S129 were thus manufactured. This is also done for phosphorylated Y39 and Y125, which have been reported in both controls and patients: at least three other sites (S87, Y133, Y136) are candidates (Taymans and Baekelandt, 2014), but to our knowledge these have not been identified in brain. This study examines for a-syn 15-mer derivatives of the nitrated residues and the sequences containing the dopamine-reacted sequence prepared as above (Martinez-Vicente et al., 2008). For tau, each candidate epitope of 15 mer peptides containing the 20 candidate phosphorylated residues, including the 10 phosporylated residues found in PD (Duka et al., 2013), are examined for T cell response. SubAim 1.2: Identify antigenic responses against possible epitopes in patients and controls. The binding algorithms in SubAim 1 predict how well the peptides would bind to MHC if present, but not if they are present in patients. To determine this, the presence of T cell response against the candidate antigens by patient blood-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is assessed by ELISPOT assays upon stimulation with the peptides. This assay detects and quantifies cytokine release (in this case, IF y and IL-5) from specific activated T cells. Blood from PD, AD, and LBD patients and age-matched controls is obtained during diagnosis and checkups. The Columbia University (CU) IRB Blood is drawn from up to 150 controls patients with AD and LBD (PDD/DLB) . Data were obtained from blood samples (25 ml) from 44 PD patients and 24 age-matched controls. The experiments were conducted blindly. PBMCs from these samples were isolated and exposed to pools comprising the 122 candidate class I and class II antigens and phosphorylated S129 epitopes generated in Subaim 1. For the PBMCs responsive to the pooled peptides, the response was then deconvoluted to identify individual epitopes. As shown in FIG. 13, there are two regions that contain epitopes in these patients: one includes Y39, which has two shorter antigenic epitopes (37VLYVGSKTK45 (SEQ ID NO: 25), 36GVLYVGSKTK45 (SEQ ID NO: 29)) and two longer antigenic epitopes that differ by one amino acid, 31G TKEG LYVGSKTK45 (SEQ ID NO: 59) and 32KTKEGVLYVGSKTKE46 (SEQ ID NO: 34) . This region is very close to the several pathogenic mutations in the protein (A30P E46K H50Q G51D A53T) that in some cases were found to interfere with normal CMA degradation (Cuervo et al . , 2004). Y39 has recently been discovered to be present in a phosphorylated state in both patients and controls (see Introduction) . The two long epitopes have very high affinity for HLA-D subtypes identified in GWAS studies to cause PD (see Aim 2) . The second antigenic region is for regions containing S129 when phosphorylated, which as above is present at very high levels in PD patient blood as well as brain (Anderson et al., 2006). There is presently no restriction found for S129, and they could be recognized by multiple HLA alleles. A correlation was not found between gender, age, or disease duration in the 44 patients. The strongest T cell response in PD patients to the two regions was observed in long (15-mer) peptides (class II specific) . However, a response to the short peptides was only observed in PD patients in these two regions, with no response in controls (p < 0.005), so both short and long peptides promise diagnostic and biomarker data. In summary, 50% of PD patients examined respond to the antigens, with 32% responding to the Y39 epitopes and 23% to the phospho-S129 epitopes with a combined difference between PD patients (n=44) and controls (n = 24) of p< 0.005. Thus, PD patients possess specific T cells that recognize a-syn as a foreign protein. These Data indicate that PD has autoimmune features. Note that while not all PD patients exhibit this autoimmune reaction, the level of response is variable in patients over the course of weeks in classical autoimmune disorders such as T1D or MS: e.g., these results already show higher levels of response than most with T1D, which are often -20% of individuals (Martinuzzi et al., 2008; Peakman, 2008; Petrich de arquesini et al., 2010; Velthuis et al., 2010; Wu et al . , 2012; Sarikonda et al . , 2014). It is possible that the few control subjects who also possessed T cells that response to a-syn are in a pre-clinical stage or in danger of developing the disease. Expected outcomes and limitations: The Results demonstrate an autoimmune response in PD. The experiments performed 1) compare autoimmune response to a-syn and tau as features of PD, LBD and AD 2) identify the epitope regions responsible for the antigenic response 3) determine the effects of three candidate posttranslational modifications (phosphorylation, nitration, dopamine modification) that arise during neurodegenerative processes . The findings of T cell response to a-syn epitopes by PD patients vs. age-matched controls (p < 0.005) should introduce the concept of an autoimmune component in PD. Tau shows similar components. Tau is highly phosphorylated in these disorders, its aggregations overlap with a-syn to different extents in each disorders, mutations in MAPT are linked to PD, and it undergoes the same degradation pathway by CMA and blocks this pathway in modified forms (Wang et al., 2009). The particular forms of phospho-tau particular to each disease induce a T cell response particularly in patients with that disease, while reaction to a-syn may be less prominent in AD patients, but the overlap in these disorders makes these assays important to conduct. Tau and a-syn are only two candidates for autoimmune response, and for example LRRK2 is highly phosphorylated and may participate, as well as many additional neurodegeneration-linked proteins . Methods. PD subjects. Age-matched PD patients and controls are recruited from the Center for Parkinson's Disease (CPD) at Columbia University. Control participants are usually the spouse or other non-blood related caregivers of PD patients in the Center. PD inclusion criteria is based on UK Brain Bank criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PD. These require 1) the presence of bradykinesia and either rest tremor or rigidity; 2) asymmetric onset; 3) progressive motor symptoms 4) age at onset 40-99 years, 5) patients with autoimmune disorders are excluded. Control inclusion criteria are similar but with lack of PD in first-degree blood relatives (an exception was made for one patient mentioned above), no evidence of PD on exam. AD subjects re recruited from the Aging and Dementia Center at Columbia University and examinedGenetic, demographic and clinical data is collected. LBD subjects arrive via both the CPD and Aging and Dementia Center. The criteria for diagnosis for AD are according to the NIA/NIH guidelines (McKhann et al . , 2011), and for LBD, the guidelines of the DLB consortium (McKeith et al., 2005). The number of patients planned for testing is currently set at 50 per group, based on the incidence of T cell response to date in 50% of patients (see below) .

In cells expressing common HIA class II alleles, two HLA alleles were found to bind with high affinity to the two antigens (SEQ ID NO: 59 and 34, respectively) containing Y39, which was produced high responses in PD patients (see FIG. 13) . Modified peptide candidates. To determine whether the phosphorylated epitopes are major targets of recognition by T cells in patients, for each case, 15-mer chains, which are sufficient for MHC-II binding, are made encompassing phosphorylated residues. As the computational protocols above do not include analysis of phosphorylated sites, 15-mers that overlap by each 10 amino acids are produced, which is sufficient to determine particularly antigenic portions of the hyperphosphorylated protein. For -syn, nitrated and dopamine modified residues above (aa39, 129, 125-129) are prepared as in our previous publication (Martinez-Vicente et al., 2008). Immunological methods. PMBC fractions are recovered by standard methods with Picoll gradient and T cells expansion (Oseroff et al., 2010) . The methods for the analysis of T cell reactions and measurement of cytokines production using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay are published in analogous experiments to discover antigens in multiple sclerosis (Lolli et al., 2013) and in hay fever allergens (Oseroff et al., 2010). T cell responses are determined by measuring IFNy and IL-5 release by ELISPOT. Statistical analysis of differences between populations is expected to be non-parametric and analyzed with the U-Mann-Whitney test. If there were a normal distribution of response, which is a priori unlikely as some patients have no T cell response, with an SD = 1, 8 patients per group would be required to provide a p > 90% that the study detect a >2 fold difference at a two-sided 0.05 significance level. Aim 2. Characterize the neoantigen-responsive T cells in AD, FD LBD. Hypothesis: T cells responsive to neoantigens in neurodegenerative disorders encompass memory CD4* and CD8* T cell subsets that have undergone clonal expansion during the progression of the disease. Plan: This study identifies and characterizes the phenotype of subsets of responsive T cells from patients using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and tetramers of specific HLA alleles of epitopes determined in Aim 1. This may provide a means for diagnosis of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders, as well as biomarkers. Sub-Aim 2.1. Determine HLA Restriction of T cell Response. Aim 1 shows if antigens are present in the patient blood, but particular antigens are restricted to presentation by specific HLA alleles. First, the allelic variants that are capable of presenting specific epitopes are determined for antigens identified in Aim 1 by standard HLA binding assays employing cell lines transfected with single HLA allelic variants. These experiments identify the HLA subtypes particularly prone to presenting each epitope. Using the Sette lab's standard in vitro MHC-peptide binding assays that examines binding in >90 of MHC-II alleles in the human population, it was found that two alleles, DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01 : 01, which are typically linked, express very high binding to the antigenic epitopes containing ex-syn Y39 (Table 4) . Sub-Aim 2.2. Determine HLA Restriction of T cell Response. Sub-Aim 2.1 indicates HLA alleles that can bind epitopes, but not that they do so in patients. Therefore, the HLA class I and/or class II restriction alleles of the responding T cells using the same PBMCs as in Aim 1 are demonstrated by inhibition with locus specific antibodies (anti HLA class I, anti DR, DP and DQ antibodies). The correspondence between HLA genotype for each PBMC donor and the results of identified antigenic peptides in Aim 1 predicts the HLA restriction for each epitope. In 35 PD patients that were genotyped, it was confirmed that the same two common HLA-DR alleles (DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01:01) that bound Y39 epitopes in the in vitro assay were that are highly associated with responses to the Y39 epitopes in the PD patients. These two alleles, which are in linkage disequilibrium and frequently expressed together, have been associated separately with PD by GWAS linkage studies (Wissemann et al■ , 2013) (Table 4). The odds ratio of the presence of these genotypes in 35 patients assayed which showed p values of < 0.003, confirming that these two Y39 antigens are restricted to the two HLA alleles in PD patients (Table Table 5. Odds ratio of the presence of these genotypes in 35 patients. A+, possesses allele; R+, T cell response. Sub-Aim 2.3: Investigate the functional phenotype of neoantigen responsive T cells. The identification of the epitopes in Aim 1 allows the determination of the functional characterization of the responsive T cells, including the important issue of whether these are memory cells previously exposed to the antigens. To do so, epitope-specific T cells are stained to establish if they are CD4* or CD8*. The phenotype identification is performed for each autoimmune reactive epitope using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) . ICS to determine the T cell subtype will use cytokines including, but not limited to IFNy, T Fcx, IL-4, IL-17, IL-10, and IL-21. Additional staining for specific surface markers, including CD45 A, CCR7 , and CD62L will classify whether the T cells are naive or memory cells, and determine their activation/exhaustion states, which will indicate if the T cells have been active in the patients. If antigen-specific T cells are of a "memory phenotype" , it will mean that the T cells have been previously exposed and responded to the protein in the patient, and may therefore be involved in the development and/or progression of disease. The responsive T cells to be analyzed are present in low amounts, and so identifying the functional phenotype requires 10-fold larger blood draws for this purpose (half of a typical 500 ml blood donation, i.e., 250 ml rather than 25 ml for all other blood draws in this proposal) . This procedure has been approved for PD patients by CUMC IRB and is expanded to AD and LBD patients . The number of patients analyzed for T cell type is 15, based on the Results that ~ 50% show response, yielding ~7 opportunities to screen for memory cells, and as the alleles showing restriction occur in -15% of the general population, although 40% of the PD patients examined to date (Table 5) . Sub-Aim 2.3. Quantify and further characterize responsive patient T cells by using tetramers. The combination of allele and epitope is used to produce tetramers that quantify the reactive T cells in individuals (Cecconi et al., 2010). This technique is used as a new means to identify preclinical PD, and by extension, is used in other neurodegenerative disorders that show autoimmune features . For proven HLA allele-epitope combinations , tetramers are produced to stain and phenotype expanded cells to quantify the autoimmune reactive T cells in patients. For example, we tetramers of DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01:01 and their two restricted peptides shown in Table 5 are produced. While these T cells recognize this combination in many PD patients but not controls, this allows the quantification of T cells that recognize the restricted epitopes in individual patients; the numbers of specific T cells is correlated with OPDRS scores to determine if this assay might provide a progression biomarker. A battery of such tetramers could provide a general screening to identify "prodromal" individuals, or those that are in danger of developing particular diseases, and eventually could lead to individualized therapies. Expected outcomes and limitations, without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, robust results show HLA allele restriction in PD, provide an explanation for some causes of PD. The typing of T cells determines if the identified antigens are restricted to particular human HLA class I and/or class II phenotypes, while determining the state of responsive T cells provides insight into the biological role they play in neurodegenerative pathogenic processes. For example, if a-syn-specific T cells are memory cells, the T cells have already been exposed to that antigen in that individual , and thus they become suspects in the development and/or progression of disease. Finally, the use of tetramer technology allows individual patients to be screened to characterize their responsive T cells against specific neonantigens ,- this provides a new means for screening, individualized therapy, identification of prodromal patients, and the development of biomarkers for the autoimmune components of these diseases. Methods. PMBC fractions are obtained by standard gradient methods use Ficoll gradient and T cells are expanded as published (Oseroff et al . , 2010). The methods for in vitro restriction and T cell ICS assay developed by Sette and collaborators have already been optimized for multiple sclerosis (Lolli et al., 2013) and hay fever (Oseroff et al., 2010) in analogous experiments. HLA typing is performed using standard methods (Oseroff et al . , 2010). Aim 3. Determine the role of HLA restricted alpha-synuclein antigen presentation in a PD mouse model. An experimental question central to the Overall Hypothesis that cannot be tested in human, as it requires the induction of neuronal death, is if the presentation of these epitopes can lead to neurodegeneration. Neurons derived from pluripotent human stem cells could be used, and indeed have been used in publications including the demonstration that these present MHC-I following interferon- gamma (IFN-γ) (Cebrian et al., 2014c). However, components including blood, vasculature, astrocytes, microglia, and other neurons required to emulate the immune response in brain would be lacking. Thus, mouse models are used to address whether neuronal death be driven by ot-syn epitopes presented by HLA. Hypothesis: Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it is suggested that SN neurons in vivo undergo neuroinflammatory stress or death if the combination of a specific antigen by MHC and the appropriate responsive T cells are present . In Aim 2 , such specific epitope and antigen combinations are identified to include specific epitopes restricted to two common HLA alleles, DRB1*15:01 and DRB5*01:01, that also have been found independently in GWAS studies to cause PD. As mentioned in the above, David Standaert's lab recently showed that viral overexpression of a-syn in mice using AAV leads to SN dopamine neuron death but that neuronal death, is absent in mice null for MHC-II (Harms et al., 2013). Equally important, a prominent immunologist, Chilla David of the Mayo Clinic, has produced and donates a mouse line that expresses only human DRBl*15:01 on a background otherwise null for MHC-II. This line has already been used for studies on autoimmunity including for Rh factor (Bernardo et al. , 2014) . Thus, it is tested whether this SN neuronal death and associated features of PD can be replaced in MHC-II null mice by specific reinstatement of the particular gene implicated in presentation of the identified epitopes. The results are compared with standard inbred strains, the MHC-II knockout, the MHOI knockout, and a additional MHC-II line that does not show restriction for the antigenic epitopes identified in Aim 1. Plan: 1) Choice of a-syn mouse model. As neuronal antigen presentation and death cannot be assessed in living human, a mouse PD model is used. No "perfect" PD mouse model has been published despite decades of efforts. The classical models use neurotoxins specific for DA SN neurons, including MPTP and 60HDA, but while these are effective at determining the consequences of DA neuron loss, there is a strong and reasonable doubt that these exogenous toxins recapitulate important steps in PD pathogenesis . Significant effort has therefore gone into developing a-syn animal models , as a-syn aggregation is a convergent pathology for nearly all PD patients (an exception is for some rare juvenile PD due to parkin mutations) . The a-syn transgenic models have to date proven difficult to apply for this purpose, most of which do not display neuronal death in the SN (Magen and Chesselet, 2010) . The only studies of a-syn transgenic mice that display extensive SN dopamine neuronal death involve the overexpression of the A53T mutant (Lin et al., 2012; Oliveras-Salva et al., 2014; Chen et al . , 2015), which is extremely rare in PD and less applicable to a model of how a-syn may act in idiopathic PD. Viral vectors that overexpress a-syn, in contrast, have successfully produced nigrostriatal degeneration (Kirik et al., 2002; St Martin et al., 2007). This may not be surprising, as in humans, overexpression of wild-type a-syn due to gene multiplication causes rare and virulent familial PD (Singleton et al., 2003). Adeno- associated virus vector, serotype 2 (AAV2-SYN) is considered, which was introduced in rat models, to provide the best available model to test this hypothesis, as it replicates several important features of PD: synucleinopathy (Kirik et al . , 2003), age-dependent neuronal loss in the SN that progresses slowly (Yamada et al . , 2004; St Martin et al., 2007), substantial suppression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and striatal DA levels (Kirik et al., 2002) and mild motor impairment according to the apomorphine rotation and paw-reaching behavioral tests (Kirik et al., 2002). An AAV2-SYN mouse PD model from the Standaert lab is adapted in which human ot-syn is overexpressed by intracerebral injection (Theodore et al . , 2008), and as mentioned, the model is mentioned to indicate a role for MHC-II expression in SN neuronal death (Harms et al., 2013). Injection of AAV2-SYN in the SN of WT mice results in 1) no immediate neuronal death after the injection, no visible neuronal loss after 3 months, and 30% SN neuronal death after 6 months; 2) proliferation of macrophages in the brain; 3) an increase in the levels of immunoglobulins and proinflammatory cytokines peaking 2 weeks post injection, 4) infiltration of B and T lymphocytes (Theodore et al., 2008). Results. By 2 weeks post AAV, there is excellent colocalization of SN DA neurons and virally expressed human wild-type a-syn and GFP used as a control (FIG. 14) . Experimental Groups. For each mouse line, AAV2-GFP and AAV2-SYN treated mice are compared. The genotypes compared are 1) wild type (WT: C57BL/6) , 2) the same line deficient for MHC-I 3) or deficient for MHC-II 4) the DRB1*15:01 in the MHC-II background 5) a DRB1*04:01 line; while this allele is implicated in T1D and MS, it has no affinity for the epitopes examined, and may provide a useful negative control . Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it is hypothesizes that the MHC-I deficient lines may not show neurodegeneration, as shown for MHC-II deficient lines by the Standaert group (Harms et al., 2013). It is hypothesized that neurodegeneration should be reinstated following AAV injection in the DRB1*15:01, but not the DRB1*04:01 line. MHC response. In WT mice, the a-syn expressing virus induces far more MHC-I and MHC-II (FIG. 15) protein in SN than the GFP control. MHC-I immunolabel in SN was also substantially higher, indicating that SN neuronal MHC-I is indeed inducible. MHC-I and II will be examined in each experimental group. Neurodegeneration. The AAV2-SYN PD model in WT mice causes a delayed neuronal loss in SN 3 to 6 months after the infection, when 30% of neuronal death is observed (St Martin et al., 2007; Theodore et al., 2008) . Neuronal loss in response to a-syn and control GFP virus is compared 12 and 24 weeks post-injection in each line. Cell counting is performed with a computer assisted stereological toolbox software program (Stereo Investigator, MBF, USA) used in the Sulzer lab with the optical fractionator method. Behavioral tests are performed in AAV2-GFP and AAV2-SYN treated mice of each genotype at 3 and 6 months after the injection. The corridor test is performed to address the lateralization of the lesion (Dowd et al., 2005; Fleming et al . , 2013), and the beam traversal challenge test, the cylinder test and the adhesive test, to assess the motor abilities of the injected mice. DA release and reuptake, which should be decreased with SN axonal degeneration, is measured in striatal slice using cyclic voltammetry methods standard, and in part developed, by the Sulzer lab, which have used in a variety of mouse models of PD (Abeliovich et al., 2000; Schmitz et al . , 2013; Mosharov et al., 2014). Cytokine analysis. Injection of AAV2-SYN in the WT mice caused a profound increase in several proinflammatory cytokines 2 weeks post- injection (Theodore et al., 2008). ELISAs are performed to detect the release of IFN-γ, TNF-a (FIG. 17), IL-Ιβ (three major proinflammatory cytokines) and IL-17A (an indicator of activated T cells) in the SN of WT and MHC-I KO mice, 2 weeks post-injection. Macrophage label. In WT animals, injection of AAV2-SYN produces a marked proliferation of macrophages in the brain (Theodore et al., 2008), which reaches maximum levels 4 weeks post-injection. 40 um brain cryosections are immunolabelled 4 weeks after the injection for the macrophage/microglial markers, Iba-1 and CDllb. Astrogliosis are addressed by the levels of GFAP. Quantification of the levels of those proteins is assessed by western blot. Infiltration of B and T lymphocytes. AAV2-SYN in the WT animals caused infiltration of B and T lymphocytes in the mouse SN (Theodore et al., 2008) 2 to 12 weeks after the injection. The presence, location and quantification of these two types of lymphocytes in the SN of each line is assessed. Adjacent SN sections of both groups of animals are immunolabeled for CD4 to mark helper T cells, CD8 to mark cytotoxic T cells, and CD45R (a marker for B cells). The quantification of infiltrated lymphocytes is assessed by western blot and unbiased stereology. Expected outcomes; MHC-II null mice, as previously shown, are protected from AAV2-SYN injection, but neurodegeneration is reinstated in mice expressing DRB1*15:01, but not DRB1*04:01. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it is anticipated that AAV2-SYN injection of MHC-I null mice may trigger neuroinflamination (activated microglia, presence of proinflammatory cytokines, infiltration of lymphocytes), but that the downstream SN DA neuronal death may be blocked, although it may also be that MHC-I plays little role, which would also be important. These results provide an important in vivo test of the hypothesis that display of antigen restricted to a human MHC-II allele associated with PD leads to selective neurodgeneration in the disease. Together with the set of data in vitro and in human, this redefines the immunological component of PD, and provides evidence for a novel mechanism of neuronal death due to T-cell activity. Methods: Recombinant adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 ( AAV2 ) containing the gene for human aSYN (AAV2-SYN) or green fluorescent protein (AAV2-GFP) virus packaged as published (Zolotukhin et al., 1999; Theodore et al., 2008). 3.5xl012 viral genome/ml for AAV2-SYN and 5.3xl012 viral genome/ml for AAV2-GFP is injected stereotaxically into the right SN pars compacta of the mice (coordinates: anterio - posterior, -3.2 mm from bregma, medio-lateral, -1.2 from midline and dorso-ventral , -4.6 from the dura). Half of the animals on each group are transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline, and transferred to sucrose 30% for cryosectioning. 40 μπι sections are serially collected in order to perform immunolabel. The SN of other the half is dissected, homogenated and quantified in the appropriate lysis buffer to be assayed by western blot or ELISA. Plans. The present study leads to new means to provide individualized therapy in neurodegeneration. One such possible therapy is "tolerization", as performed for allergens, in which T cells are trained to recognize otherwise activating proteins as self , Tolerization therapy and T cell suppression may provide therapy for PD. Further potential additional PD-related antigens, such as LRRK2 and glucocerbrosidase, are examined. There are important basic neuronal biology questions to address, particularly to elucidate why these proteins are loaded onto MHC, presumably when they are misfolded. This would intersect with the endosomal, lysosomal and proteosomal pathways responsible for the generation of antigenic fragments, and may would shed light on why this occurs with increased age and during the course of certain diseases. The phosphorylated S129 residue may be particularly antigenic due to "cross presentation", and, if so, this should be replicatable on the responsible T cells isolated from patients. Tetramer technology using particular HLA-epitope combinations can be used with high sensitivity and specificity to stain and track specific T cells in blood and other human tissue, including histological sections and autopsy samples. These reagents can be utilized to further probe the potential role of T cells that react specifically to -syn. They can also be used to ascertain if individuals have oi-syn-responsive T cells prior to the disease, and may provide a biomarker for its progression, which would be valuable for future therapy. This study contributes to understanding the pathogenesis of PD. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, T cells may be activated first by peripheral display of antigens prior to infiltrating and inducing damage in the CNS. This could explain, for example, how an infectious agent like influenza travels through the nervous system. Some investigations show that influenza virus elicits neuroinflammatory responses that persist long after the primary infection (Jang et al., 2009a). Discussion Antigen presentation requires the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This involves the partial intracellular degradation of self and non-self proteins into 8-14 amino acid peptides, loading them to the antigen binding groove of the MHC class I (MHC-I) or class II (MHC-II), and translocating the complex to the cell surface for display (Chemali et al., 2011). Although detection of MHC-I in the mature rodent central nervous system (CNS) was for many years confined to glial cells (Wong et al., 1984) a body of continuing reports demonstrates that MHC-I can be expressed by some neuronal populations, both in vitro, usually triggered by exposure to interferon gamma (IFN-γ) , and in vivo. An initial study showed that MHC-I genes could be induced by IFN-γ in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Neumann et al., 1995). Subsequently, mRNA for MHC-I was identified in multiple regions of the neonatal and adult rodent brain including the substantia nigra (SN) , brainstem motor neurons (Linda et al., 1999) the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) , the cortex, the hippocampus (Huh et al., 2000) and cerebellum (Letellier et al . , 2008). Subunits of the MHC-I molecule were detected by immunolabel in these regions (Needleman et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012), with expression gradually decreasing as neonatal mice reached adulthood in regions including cingulate cortex and the hippocampus (Liu et al., 2012). These data suggest a potential role of MHC-I in early development that may be absent in maturity. Neuronal MHC-I expression is thought to play a role in early developmental synaptic plasticity (Goddard et al., 1998; Corriveau et al., 1998; Glynn et al . , 2011), in regeneration of neurons after axotomy (Oliveira et al . , 2004) and in hippocampus-dependent memory (Nelson et al., 2013). MHC-I expression has also been shown in cultured hippocampal embryonic neurons that were targeted and killed by CD8* cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in response to exogenous viral or ovalbumin (OVA) -derived antigens (Medana et al . , 2000; Meuth et al., 2009) Finally, neurons can be MHC-I-dependent targets for CTLs following neurotropic viral infections (Chevalier et al., 2011). In humans, MHC-I has been reported in microglia and endothelia of the hippocampus in control individuals and Alzheimer's disease patients (Tooyama et al . , 1990). MHC-II immunolabel of microglia, but not neurons, has been reported in the SN of patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (PD) (McGeer et al . , 1988) and in the hippocampus of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (Imamura et al., 2005). Neuronal expression of MHC-I in the human brain has only been reported in a small number of studies . The first was a study of a childhood viral infection, asmussen's encephalitis, in which immunolabel for the MHC-I component, beta 2 microglobulin (β2πι) , was present in cortical and hippocampal neurons (Bien et al., 2002); more recently, MHC-I has also been observed in dysmorphic/dysphasic cortical neurons of focal cortical dysplasia, tuberous sclerosis complex and ganglioglioma cases (Prabowo et al., 2013) and in the embryonic LGN of the dorsal thalamus (Zhang et al., 2013a) and hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2013b). In the LGN, β2πι was observed at 29-31 gestational weeks but was nearly absent by postnatal day 55, and was completely absent in the adult (Zhang et al . , 2013a). MHC-I in the human visual cortex was not observed at any gestational or postnatal stage (Zhang et al., 2013a), while the expression of MHC-I was very low in the hippocampus at 20 gestational weeks and slowly increased during weeks 27-33. A rapid increase in MHC-I molecule expression was found in the subiculum that reached high levels at 31- 33 gestational weeks, but no expression of MHC-I was found in the adult hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2013b). To date, there has been no evidence reported of neuronal MHC-I expression in the normal adult human brain. Recent reports have demonstrated that some rodent neurons express major histocompatibilty complex class I (MHC-I), but expression of this antigen-presenting protein has not been reported in normal adult human neurons . Evidence provided herein from immunolabel , RNA expression, and mass spectrometry in human postmortem samples demonstrates that the majority of human pigmented substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) and locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrinergic neurons express MHC-I. MHC-I expression was also induced in human stem cell derived DA neurons. Dsing murine primary neurons as a model, experiments in the Examples herein found that catecholamine neurons were far more responsive to induction of MHC-I by gamma- interferon than other neuronal populations examined. In addition, neuronal MHC-I was induced by factors released from microglia activated by neuromelanin or alpha-synuclein or by treating the neurons with the catecholamine precursor, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine, suggesting that cytosolic DA and/or oxidative stress may trigger selective MHC-I expression. The inventors observed that these neurons internalized foreign ovalbumin and displayed the ovalbumin- derived antigen SIINFEKL (SEQ ID NO: 9), and that the combination of antigen presentation with MHC-I expression triggered DA neuronal death by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. These results indicate that T cell infiltration of the central nervous system observed in neurodegenerative disease coupled with antigen/MHC-I display may lead to death of SN and LC neurons . Although the detection of MHC-I in the mature rodent central nervous system (CNS) was for many years confined to glial cells (Wong et al., 1984), a body of developing work demonstrates that MHC-I can be expressed by some neuronal populations, both in vitro, usually triggered by exposure to interferon gamma (IFN-γ) , and in vivo. An initial study from Neumann et al. (1995) showed that MHC-I genes could be induced by IFN-γίη cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Following that report, mRNA for MHC-I has been identified in several regions of the neonatal and adult rodent brain including the substantia nigra (SN) , brainstem motor neurons (Linda et al., 1999), the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) , the cortex, the hippocampus (Huh et al., 2000) and cerebellum (Letellier et al., 2008). Subunits of the MHC-I molecule have also been detected by immunolabel in these regions (Needleman et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012), with expression gradually decreasing in regions including cingulate cortex and the hippocampus as the newborn mice reached adulthood (Liu et al., 2012). These data suggest a potential role of MHC-I in early development that may be absent in maturity. Neuronal MHC-I expression is thought to play a role in early developmental synaptic plasticity (Goddard et al., 2007; Corriveau et al., 1998; Shatz, 2009; Glynn et al . , 2011; Elmer and McAllister, 2012), in the regeneration of neurons after axotomy (Oliveira et al., 2004; Sabha et al . , 2008) and in hippocampus-dependent memory (Nelson et al., 2013). The expression of MHC-I has also been shown in hippocampal embryonic neurons in culture that were targeted and killed by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in response to exogenous viral or ovalbumin (OVA) -derived antigens (Medana et al., 2000; Meuth et al . , 2009). In addition, there is evidence showing that neurons can be MHC-I-dependent targets for CTLs upon neurotropic viral infection (Rail et al . , 1995; Richter et al . , 2009; Chevalier et al. , 2011) . In humans, MHC-I has been reported in microglia and endothelia of the hippocampus in control individuals and Alzheimer's disease patients (Tooyama et al., 1990). MHC-II immunolabel of microglia, but not neurons, has been shown in the SN of patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (PD) (McGeer et al . , 1988), and in hippocampus of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (Imamura et al., 2005). Neuronal expression of MHC-I in the human brain has only been reported in 1) a study of a childhood viral infection, Rasmussen's encephalitis, in which immunolabel for the MHC-I component, beta 2 microglobulin (β2πι) , was identified in cortical and hippocampal neurons (Bien et al . , 2002), and 2) in the LGN of the dorsal thalamus (Zhang et al., 2013a) and the hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2013b) of embryos. In the LGN, β2κι was observed at 29-31 gestational weeks but decreased with development and was nearly absent at postnatal day 55 and completely absent in adult LGN (Zhang et al . , 2013a). MHC-I in the visual cortex was not observed at any gestational or postnatal stage (Zhang et al . , 2013a). These authors also showed that the expression of MHC-I was very low in the hippocampus at 20 gestational weeks and slowly increased at 27-33. A rapid increase in MHC-I molecules expression was found in the subiculum that reached high levels at 31-33 gestational weeks, but no expression of MHC-I was found in the hippocampal formation of adults (Zhang et al., 2013b). To date, there has been no evidence reported of the presence of neuronal MHC-I expression in the normal adult human brain. The Examples herein show that 1) in human postmortem samples from adult control individuals, MHC-I is expressed by SN dopaminergic (DA) and locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrinergic (NE) neurons, 2) human stem cell (hES)-in vitro- derived DA neurons can be induced to express MHC-I in their membranes, 3) catecholamine murine neurons in primary culture are more prone to display MHC-I upon IFN-γ challenge than non-catecholamine neurons, 4) SN DA murine neurons in culture display MHC-I in response to microglia activated by neuromelanin (NM) or alpha-synuclein (a-syn) , substances found extracellularly in postmortem PD brain, 5) in the absence of microglia, chronic exposure to the DA precursor, Ldihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) , induces MHC-I in SN DA murine neurons, 6) SN murine neurons in culture can process and present foreign protein antigens by MHC-I, 7) in the presence of the appropriate antigen and CTLs, MHC-I expressing SN murine neurons are destroyed. These findings suggest that neuronal MHC-I expression and antigen display in catecholamine neurons are triggered by microglial activation or high cytosolic DA, which, in the presence of the appropriate antigen and CTLs might play a critical role in neuronal death during diseases like PD in which CNS inflammation is robust. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, an immunologically-based mechanism that may link activated microglia, increased cytosolic oxidative stress and neuronal death of catecholamine neurons is proposed herein. Microglia activated by NM, native oi-syn, modified a-syn, or mutant a-syn release IFN-γ that in turn induce HC-I expression in neurons. Catecholamine neurons may be subject to additional oxidative stress due to the presence of cytosolic DA, and this could lead to their MHC-I induction. The capacity of catecholamine neurons to process and display antigens may render them selective targets for T cell mediated cell death. Although CNS neurons have been classically considered "immunoprivileged" and to not present antigen, several studies have identified neuronal MHC-I expression in rodents (Neumann et al., 1995; Huh et al . , 2000; Medana et al . , 2000; Oliveira et al., 2004; Goddard et al., 2007; Corriveau et al., 1998; Meuth et al., 2009; Needleman et al., 2010; Glynn et al., 2011). To our knowledge, the first data demonstrating that human adult SN and LC neurons express MHC-I, as confirmed by a variety of approaches, is provided herein. First, immunolabel for both MHC-I subunits, HLA and 2m, was detected in SN and LC neurons by fluorescent, histochemical and electron microscopic means. Second, mRNA for both subunits was identified in laser captured SN NM-containing neurons. Third, using mass spectrometry, p2m and specific HLA alleles were identified both in isolated NM organelles and purified NM from organelles and tissues. The human population expresses thousands of HLA-A, B and C alleles (Marsh et al., 2005), and remarkably, in samples of isolated NM organelles and purified NM obtained from a single subject's SN, mass spectrometry identified peptides that indicate the expression of specific HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C alleles (Table 1 and 2) Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it is thus concluded that in contrast to a long-standing consensus, a subset of adult human neurons express MHC-I. In agreement with previous studies (Prabowo et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013a; Zhang et al . , 2013b), the presence of neuronal MHC-I or β2πι was not found in other regions of the adult brain examined including cortex, the hippocampus or the striatum. Human stem cell-derived DA neurons that exhibit properties of SN DA neurons (Kriks et al . , 2011), were also induced to express MHC-I by human IFN-γ, a response analogous to that of mouse neurons. Thus, multiple lines of independent data demonstrate that human neurons, in particular catecholamine neurons, possess the ability to express MHC-I in their cell membrane. When the expression of HLA in TH* neurons was compared in postmortem samples from control versus PD individuals in Examples herein, the proportion of HLA* in SN and LC neurons was found to be higher in control than in pathological specimens (Fig. IE and IF) . This would be expected if neurons that were HLA* were selectively destroyed over the course of the disease. However, without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, emphasis is made to interpret the results cautiously, as the initial proportion of HLA* cannot be ascertained, nor can the duration that human neurons express the protein. In many cases, moreover, the total number of surviving NMVTH* neurons, especially in the LC PD sections, was very low and unlikely to reflect the proportion during early disease stages. It is further possible that the presence of HLA in human catecholamine neurons is related to another biological process and not to antigen presentation. In Examples herein, an association of MHC-I and NM organelles was identified by mass specrometry and immunolabel. ISM organelles are autophagic lysosomes that trap and concentrate cytosolic and organelle proteins, and NM synthesis is induced by cytosolic DA(Sulzer et al., 2000). These lysosomal compartments may participate in neuronal antigen presentation, either as an alternative to or following proteasomal processing (Kleijmeer et al., 2001; Chemali et al., 2011). New work demonstrates roles for autophagic lysosomes in the MHC-I response to bacterial infection (Fiegl et al . , 2013), suggesting that uptake into lysosomes may participate in the normal handling and degradation of the protein. Consistent with previous studies (Neumann et al., 1995; Medana et al., 2000; Meuth et al., 2009), the data herein show that the cultured murine neurons from multiple regions (VM, LC, cortex. striatum, thalamus) could be induced to display MHC-I. The data herein demonstrate that catecholamine neurons of the VM and LC were the most responsive to MHC-I induction. L-DOPA, which is converted to cytosolic DA in SN and LC neurons, triggered MHC-I expression, consistent with a role for oxidative stress in enhancing MHC-I (Teoh and Davies, 2004) via cytosolic catecholamine oxidation. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it may be that the presence of cytosolic catecholamine is responsible for the particular presence of MHC-I in human SN and LC catecholamine neurons . Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, it is noted that these findings should not be construed as suggesting that L-DOPA should not be used clinically; the high exposures used in this study are intended to load the cytosol with high DA levels and not to emulate therapeutic L-DOPA exposure in patients with PD. Additional oxidative stress in LC and SN neurons may result from tonic neuronal firing activity driven by L-type calcium currents (Mosharov et al . , 2009; Chan et al . , 2009). The results with OT-I T cells shown herein, indicate that neuronal death ensues when neuronal MHC-I is expressed and displays a specific antigen recognized by a specific CTL. Previous studies of neuronal killing by CTLs (Medana et al . , 2000; Meuth et al., 2009) used exogenous short viral and OVA-derived peptides in culture. It is shown herein that VM DA neurons can internalize and present foreign antigen, since addition of the large precursor protein OVA to VM cultures induced SIINFEKL-MHC-I expression on the plasma membrane and within neuronal cytosol. This neuronal MHC-I is immunologically competent, as demonstrated by the induction of CTL proliferation and both Fas and perforin-based CTL neuronal killing. While the loading of peptide onto MHC-I can apparently occur in neurons as well as extracellularly, proteolytic processing of the OVA might occur in non-neuronal compartments , including in astrocytes or by extracellular proteases. There is a general consensus that many neurodegenerative diseases induce a robust inflammatory response, but it remains unclear how this inflammatory response is related to chronic neurodegeneration. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, the results shown herein suggest a selective upregulation of neuronal MHC-I, antigen presentation and cytolytic activity that may participate under some pathophysiological conditions. It has recently been demonstrated that microglia can be activated by substances released by degenerating neurons in PD, such as oi-syn (Zhang et al., 2007; Beraud et al., 2013) or NM (Zhang et al . , 2011; Zhang et al., 2013c) , and that activated microglia can elicit neurotoxic responses (Block et al., 2007; Lull and Block, 2010; Zhao et al., 2013). Both NM and α-syn are found extracellularly in the postmortem brain of PD patients (Double, 2012), a disorder that features high levels of activated microglia in the SN (Foix and Nicolesco, 1925) and high levels of intracellular oxidative stress (Fahn and Sulzer, 2004) . PD patients are reported to possess CNS chemotactic signals (Harris et al., 2012) and a compromised blood brain barrier (German et al., 2011; Farkas et al., 2000),, which may explain why CTLs are found at substantially higher numbers in PD patients than age-matched controls (Brochard et al., 2009). Catecholamine neuronal display of antigenic MHC-I could participate in a range of additional neurological disorders. For example, Japanese encephalitis virus can induce MHC-I expression in non- neuronal cells by interferon type 1 (Abraham et al., 2010), while in mice, IFN-γ plays a role in paraquat-induced neurodegeneration involving oxidative and proinflammatory pathways (Mangano et al., 2011) . CNS-directed expression of IFN-γ produces basal ganglia calcification and nigrostriatal degeneration (Chakrabarty et al., 2011). In human case studies, a link is described between chronic hepatitis C patients who were treated with type 1 interferon and developed PD-like symptoms that reversed when the treatment was halted (Almeida et al., 2009). Thus, both clinical reports and the present results suggest reason to further explore roles for activated microglia, antigen presentation, neuronal MHC-I expression, and recruitment of CTLs in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, that feature the presence of T cells, activated microglia, intracellular oxidative stress and aggregates of a-syn in the SN and LC. Mutations or duplications in the gene οί-synuclein cause Parkinson's disease (PD) . Data herein show that normal people rarely have T cells against a-synuclein, whereas to date the majority of PD patients do. The present invention is useful to diagnose, confirm, provide a biomarker for, and treat PD. As described herein, human neurons that are destroyed in PD, specifically the substnatia nigra and locus coeruleus, are to date the only adult human neurons that display the antigen presenting protein MHC-I. T cells capable of killing such neurons are already present particularly in PD brain. As described herein this system was replicated with mouse neurons, and the data herein showed that T cells indeed can kill these neurons. Without wishing to be bound by any scientific theory, these data suggest that at least some PD is in part an autoimmune disorder. There is no data in the literature of what the T cells might recognize, and the data herein is the first to show that it recognizes a-synuclein. Aspects of the present invention relate to the surprising discovery that epitopes that activate leukocytes are expressed on the surface of neurons in subjects afflicted with PD. Surprisingly, these epitopes are useful in diagnostic and treatment methods for PD. The present invention provides improved and novel methods for diagnosing, confirming, providing biomarkers for, and treating PD are needed. Additionally, specific treatments tailored for individual patients are provided herein. References Abeliovich et al.
