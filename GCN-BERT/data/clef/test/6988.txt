Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the field of measuring neurological impairment. The present invention specifically concerns presenting a battery of visual tests and recording a subject's eye position, eye movement, pupil dilation and pupil constriction to measure the severity of any traumatic brain injury. 2. Description of Related Art Traumatic brain injury can be caused by head trauma after impact. The rapid acceleration or deceleration of the brain within the cranial vault, or absorption of a shock wave can cause the brain to impact the inside of the skull. These forces can also cause stretching and/or shearing of axonal tracts (tearing of connections between neuronal cells), which can trigger secondary neurodegenerative damage and maladaptive plasticity leading to chronic neurological dysfunction. The physiological effects resulting from these injuries can be detected immediately in some cases, but can also develop slowly over minutes, hours, weeks, months, or even years post-injury. Pathological processes can evolve slowly, making them difficult to detect in stages when interventions are most effective. Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries (mTBI) can result in post-concussion syndrome and impairment in cognitive domains such as memory, processing speed, affect, impulse control, prediction/planning and other executive functions as measured by traditional neuropsychological instruments. Acute physiological changes (e.g. inflammation) following mTBI may also make an individual more susceptible to a subsequent impact due to poor judgment or slower reaction times. These repeated impacts may, in turn, make an individual more susceptible to chronic neurological injury. Therapeutic options may be developed to prevent chronic neurological damage if we can identify reliable quantitative markers (changes in physiological and neurobehavioral responses) associated with mTBI. These quantitative measures could also be used in conjunction with acceleration measurements to identify those types of impacts associated with acute and chronic neurological injury. However, there are currently no devices capable of accurately and objectively tracking subtle changes in neurophysiological status associated with either mTBI or systems that accurately measure angular acceleration of the head correlated with mTBI biomarkers. There is a critical need to identify a sensitive, rapid, easily obtainable biomarker to serve as an objective indicator of when an athlete should be withheld from play and when they can return to normal play in order to avoid permanent traumatic brain injury. Repeated concussive and even sub-clinical exposures to head trauma can produce a spectrum of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), resulting in stress points of damage in the brain, ranging in severity from mild cognitive impairment to severe dementia, disinhibited violent outbursts, motor dysfunction, reduced quality of life and even suicide. Oculomotor reactions in response to a pulse of light will reflect the status of the central nervous system following head trauma. Oculomotor reactions integrate a chain of neural events mediated by nerves passing through brain areas commonly affected by acute head trauma, and may also be affected chronically with repeated, mild head trauma which can by cumulative. This invention aims to show that the pupil light reflex and other oculomotor tests, unlike other measures of head trauma, are sensitive to acute, subclinical concussive forces and may also be used to inventory cumulative effects of mild head trauma over time, which fulfills a critical need in contact sports.

DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure include an apparatus (also referred to herein as the “NeuroTriage Headset”). Exemplary embodiments are designed to detect physiological changes associated with mild traumatic brain injuries. Exemplary embodiments are designed to measure changes in neurological function following mTBI and compare those measurements to baseline measures to detect changes in neurological status. Embodiments of the invention may include web based applications that will allow the data to be collected and analyzed in real time. This will allow individuals and their health care teams to identify changes in neurological status compared to baseline measurements. These devices may predict the long-term neurological consequences of mTBI. Exemplary embodiments may prove useful in providing the information needed to develop strategies, rules, and interventions to minimize neurological damage due to head impacts. NeuroTriage Headset and Method of Evaluation. Physicians have long used a battery of oculomotor observations in the evaluation of neurological status. These observations range from eye reflexes, such as the pupillary light reflex, eye pursuit, saccadic and vergence movements, and visual performance tasks that require significant cognitive load (i.e., memory and concentration). Recently it has been shown that constriction latency, average constriction velocity, and dilation velocity obtained from the pupillary light reflex are indicators of mTBI in blast-exposed individuals (Capo-Aponte et al., 2013). These measures are quantifiable and repeatable, providing a method for following changes in neurological status after an impact. These oculomotor tests can be sensitive to detecting changes in neurological status because the oculomotor system integrates with multiple brain networks and substrates that span both basic perceptual processing (reflexes) and tasks involving higher-order cognitive load (lower- and higher-order processing; levels of difficulty). The visual system interacts with virtually all other brain systems and, as a result, oculomotor-visual tests have a high likelihood of detecting dysfunctions across multiple brain regions and processing pathways. Testing was performed to investigate the function of melanopsin-expressing intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in normal subjects, and in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with a history of optic neuritis. It is theorized that patients with neurological conditions other than MS, including mTBI, may show dysfunction in the melanopsin mediated pupillary light reflex. Fifteen control individuals (n=30 eyes) and 24 patients (n=48 eyes) with multiple sclerosis were recruited for testing. All patients underwent pupillometry testing with red and blue light stimuli to observe both the non-melanopsin and melanopsin-mediated (with the latter characterized by a sustained pupillary constriction period in conjunction with a protracted dilation phase following light stimulus cessation) pupillary light reflexes. The tests further employed optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal segmentation techniques, in order to characterize the relationship between thickness of the ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer (GCL+IPL) and the disposition (normal vs abnormal) of the melanopsin-mediated pupillary response. The tests confirmed a direct and significant correlation between GCL+IPL thickness and the melanopsin response (p<001). Further, a significantly diminished melanopsin response was associated with MS eyes categorically designated with a history of acute optic neuritis (AON) when compared to MS patient eyes with no history of AON (p=0.005). More objectively, when compared to MS eyes with normal GCL+IPL thickness, the melanopsin response was significantly attenuated in MS eyes exhibiting GCL+IPL thickness reductions (p<0.0001). Notwithstanding the high incidence of subclinical optic neuropathy in the fellow eye of MS patients with a history of AON in the other eye, we performed an intra-subject, inter-eye asymmetry comparative analyses, which revealed a significant reduction in GCL+IPL thickness in eyes with a history of AON (p=0.01 for both). Perhaps the greatest advantage of oculomotor testing is that it is non-invasive, easy to analyze, and can be done on the sideline, on the side of the road, or in the clinic, requiring little effort on the part of the patient. For example, simple eye tracking assessment is currently used by trained professionals for assisting with the detection of TBI and for field sobriety testing. Quantifiable and observable oculomotor system dysfunction has been demonstrated in a number of neurological disorders and conditions, including several neurodegenerative diseases, pharmacological impairment, and blast induced mTBI. It is likely that an efficient, automated, and on-field battery of these tests that quantify physiological responses will be sensitive to detection of mTBI due to head impacts as well. The following describes a series of automated tests that can be performed with the NeuroTriage Headset. The testing should take less than five minutes to perform. In preferred embodiments, the NeuroTriage Headset uses two USB3 cameras, which may be obtained from the Imaging Source, that capture video at 150 Hz to track pupil diameter and position. In preferred embodiments, these cameras are mounted on a heads-up display and are controlled via an ATmega32U4 microcontroller. The microcontroller may be mounted on a display board that controls the presentation of stimuli. The NeuroTriage Headset includes light emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit light into the wearer's eyes. The LEDs may emit light having a wavelength between 250-950 nm. In preferred embodiments, the system includes infrared, white, red, blue, and green LEDs. In other embodiments, the system includes LEDs emitting light having a wavelength between 450-480 nm. It appears that this 450-480 nm wavelength activates melanopsin cells and the retinohypothalamic tract. This visual pathway is distinct from the pathway activated by the normal rod and cones. As a result it may be a more sensitive biomarker for detecting brain injuries or detecting different type of injury. A 3-8 multiplexor may be used to present the smooth pursuit target (eight LEDs light up in order). In some cases a 4-16 multiplexor is used. A standard visual display could be used such as from a phone, tablet, laptop or other screen. Other LEDs may be positioned at the corners for saccade tests. Two cameras, separated by approximately 3.5 inches, are mounted approximately two inches from the eyes. The NeuroTriage Headset includes software that provides a custom interface for stimulus presentation and image capture. The software accurately analyzes the eyelid borders, pupil borders, and limbus in each video frame, from which eye, lid, and pupil movement and gaze direction can be accurately determined. In preferred embodiments, the software produces a score, e.g., 1 to 100, indicating the level of neurological impairment. In some embodiments, the NeuroTriage Headsets utilize iris features and an RFID Bluetooth device to ensure proper identification of all subjects during initial and repeat testing. In preferred embodiments, the NeuroTriage Headset is in the form of a portable headset or set of goggles. FIG. 2 depicts the NeuroTriage Headset. The housing of the NeuroTriage Headset blocks external light such that the only light received by the user's eyes is from the NeuroTriage's LEDs. Various tests may be employed by the NeuroTriage Headset, including but not limited to Pupil Reflex, Saccades, Smooth Pursuit, and Critical Flicker Fusion. These tests are described in more detail below. Pupil Reflex: The pupil light reflex is the dilation and constriction of the pupil in response to changes in lighting. This reflex integrates neuronal processes mediated by brain areas and neuronal tracts commonly affected by acute head trauma. Disruption at any step can result in abnormal reflex functionality (Chen et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2003; Ritter et al., 1999; Meeker et al., 2005; Mack et al., 2008; Mohan et al., 2013). Recent studies have demonstrated that the pupil light reflex is even sensitive to acute, subclinical concussive forces (Capo-Aponte et al., 2013). It has the potential as an inventory tool for the cumulative effects of mild head trauma over time. This approach would fulfill a critical need for testing individuals with repeated exposures to mTBI. Unlike eye movement measures, the light reflex is involuntary, so it can be measured without dedicated patient cooperation. FIG. 5 is a schematic of the pupillary light reflex pathway, including a) the afferent limb (retina, including the melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, optic nerve, chiasm, optic tract and brachium of the superior colliculus), b) the inter-neuron consisting of nerves in the pretectal olivary nucleus in the midbrain which provide input via the posterior commissure to c) the efferent limb. The efferent limb consists of the pre-ganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the Edinger Westphal Nucleus. These pre-ganglionic fibers then travel within the oculomotor nerve and then into the orbit. After synapsing in the ciliary ganglion, the post-ganglionic parasympathetic neurons innervate the iris sphincter muscle. Supra-nuclear fibers from the reticular activating formation in the pons ascend into the midbrain (red arrows) to modulate the response of the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the Edinger Westphal Nucleus during states of wakefulness and sleep. The sympathetic nerves, which innervate the iris dilator, also modulate pupil size and dilation. Concussion may theoretically affect the pupil light reflex throughout any portion of this pathway. However, the most likely location is within the midbrain pathways and connecting neurons that modulate the pupil motor center. By recording both pupils at the same time in response to a light pulse given to the right eye and then to the left eye, the location of disturbances to the pupil pathway can be isolated. Two light input retinal pathways can be interrogated using the pupillary response, in addition to the central nervous system (CNS) pathways modulating the neural integration of the pupil light reflex that appear to be affected by TBI. The first pathway involves activation of the rod and cone photoreceptors using low intensity light to cause a standard transient pupil light reflex. The second pathway involves direct activation of melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells by bright blue light and results in a longer-lasting pupil contraction after the light is terminated. This pathway appears to be distinct from the rod and cone mediated pupillary response, which is more transient, as discussed above. The tests would use white light, red light and blue light separately to measure pupil dynamics. Changes in one or the other may indicate brain injuries in different neural pathways. Few studies have investigated the pupillary light reflex specifically for mTBI assessment. The dynamics of pupil movement in response to a light pulse have been condensed into a single parameter of pupil reactivity, termed the Neurological Pupil Index (NPI) which has a value ranging from zero (non-reactive) to five (most reactive). The NPI incorporates a z-scale sum of pupil size, iris mechanics, contraction amplitude, latency, contraction velocity, and dilation velocity from the normal population (3). It has been determined from previous studies of intensive care patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to normal subjects that an NPI of greater >3 is normal and <3 is associated with brain dysfunction and higher risk of morbidity (3-5). Preliminary studies have shown that NPI possesses low variability in test-retest measures of normal participants: one hundred measurements from normal eyes (patients aged 18-30) resulted in a mean NPI of 4.2±0.32, and two standard deviations from ten patients retested over five days was only 0.27 NPI units. Therefore, the NPI provides a reproducible, repeatable measurement of pupil response dynamics and a basis for defining significant change between test measurements in subjects being followed after mild TBI. Chen et al. (2011) demonstrated that a low NPI score was significantly correlated with abnormal intracranial pressure in more severely injured patients admitted to hospital intensive care units (two-tailed t-test, p=0.0014). In a number of cases, a drop in the NPI preceded the rise in intracranial pressure. In a recent publication, warfighters exposed to explosions were shown to have differences in constriction latency, average constriction velocity, dilation velocity, and 75% recovery time using a pupil dilation test (Capo-Aponte et al., 2013). An important innovation was realized from the results of a recent pilot led by the current investigators, which validated the usefulness of the NPI as an acute biomarker of TBI predicting neurological outcome. The NPI was recorded in 128 patients being evaluated for acute TBI. An abnormal NPI was predictive of outcome and seriousness of acute traumatic brain injury. Specifically, patients with an NPI≦3 (compared to patients with NPI>3) were found to have a significant likelihood of 1) worse Glascow Coma Scale, 2) head CT scan abnormalities, 3) need for neurosurgical intervention, 4) longer length of hospitalization, and 5) need for skilled care after discharge. These results showed that the NPI is a significant biomarker of acute brain trauma that is predictive of outcome and the need for further evaluation. It is from this pilot data that the idea for the present study was conceived. These results are relevant to assessment of traumatic brain injury from a variety of causes, including blunt trauma from falls and motor vehicle accidents, blast-related TBI, and in the current application, to sports-related head trauma. Unlike other causes of TBI, the use of the NPI to evaluate sports related head trauma might even be more sensitive, since a baseline NPI or pregame NPI can be compared to measurements during play. For example, after sustaining a significant head impact event during play, the absolute value of the NPI may still be in the normal range, but the change from baseline may be greater than expected by chance, indicating a severe enough injury to withhold an athlete from play. Therefore, if the change in NPI reflects the severity of brain insult, then acute changes in the NPI and the duration of such changes may provide a viable biomarker for an on-field assessment of head trauma and influence decisions on safe return to play. If changes of NPI are sustained, then there may also be a use for monitoring cumulative effects of injury and relating these to assessments of cognitive function and structural changes in the brain and retina. A recent study conducted on veterans with a history of TBI compared to age matched veterans without TBI revealed permanent thinning of the inner retinal layers containing neurons which make up the optic nerve in at least 25% of eyes. These patients had no obvious abnormality on eye exam, indicating that head trauma can result in structural loss of nerves in the retina, which may be a surrogate marker for permanent brain effects, also demonstrated in our pre-clinical murine models of TBI. Non-invasive optical coherence tomography imaging (OCT) of the layers of the retina is easily obtained without pupil dilation and has no risk associated with it, making it a suitable biomarker to inventory chronic, cumulative effects of brain trauma causing permanent loss of nerves. In the preferred embodiment, the NeuroTriage Headset provides a 100 footcandle bright white, LED flash (group of four light emitting diodes for stimulating each eye) for 0.2 seconds and records the resulting pupil movements over the next three second time window. It has been previously shown that the NPI is not dependent upon the background lighting condition. All measurements may be taken under photopic background conditions, primarily outdoors. The right and left pupil movements may be recorded for each right eye and left eye light stimulus, generating a right and left pupil NPI for each light stimulus, for a total of 4 NPI determinations collected at each testing time. In another embodiment, the NeuroTriage Headset provides a 2.6 log cd/m2 LED flash using 1000 millisecond stimuli duration in each eye individually. The device may use both red LED (622 nm) and blue LED (463 nm) variants. Each stimulus should be timed so that the pupils return to their steady-state dark adaptation diameter in between each of the stimuli. Pupilary diameter may be captured at a sampling rate of 60 Hz. An isolated melanopsin response may be quantified by measuring the normalized pupil diameter six seconds after the red light stimulus and subtracting the normalized pupil diameter six seconds after a corresponding blue light stimulus of matched intensity. The system may calculate the activity of the melanopsin-driven retinomesencephalic tract, RMmel, using the following equation: RM mel = d R   6 d R   0 - d B   6 d B   0 where dR6 is the pupil diameter during the red stimulus at six seconds, dR0 is the pupil diameter immediately prior to red stimulus, dB6 is the pupil diameter during the blue stimulus at six seconds, and dB0 is the pupil diameter immediately prior to blue stimulus. The system may also calculate the transient pupil response, PTR, using the following equation: P TR = d E   0 - d B   min d E   0 where dBmin is the absolute minimal pupil diameter during the blue stimulus. FIG. 4 shows the normalized pupil diameter vs time for a control user. The red line represents pupil diameter as a function of time for the red stimulus profile. The patient is shown a unilateral red light stimulus of 2.6 log cd/m2 for one second. The pupil reaches maximum constriction shortly after the stimulus is removed and returns to baseline over a period of several seconds. The blue line represents the same experimental condition, except this time for a blue light stimulus. In this instance, the return from maximum constriction to baseline diameter is prolonged from thirty to sixty seconds. The line drawn at six seconds represents the difference in pupil diameter between the red and blue light stimuli and is what we quantify as the melanopsin response. FIG. 5 parts A and B show the pupil diameter at six seconds after photopically matched red and blue light stimuli in a normal control. The difference in pupil diameter is the melanopsin response. This is in comparison to parts C and D, which show the same experimental condition except for an MS patient's eye with severe ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) thinning under the same conditions. There is an attenuation of the melanopsin response when compared to the normal control. FIG. 6 is scatterplot and linear regression line show the melanopsin structure-function relationship as a function of normalized melanopsin response by GCL+IPL thickness. A GEE model accounting for age and adjusting for within-patient, inter-eye correlations shows a significant correlation between the melanopsin response and GCL+IPL thickness (p<0.001). Changes in NPI from baseline measurements may be compared among athletes on the sideline immediately following head impact, to those without head impact. In addition, acute changes in NPI may be correlated with a sideline neurologic assessment, SCAT3, in players with and without exposure to head trauma over time. For each test time, the right and left pupil response is recorded simultaneously for a right eye light stimulus and then for a left eye light stimulus, yielding a total of four NPI measurements. To localize the site of the pupil light reflex pathway affected by acute impact, the four NPI measurements will be grouped in an attempt to isolate afferent, central and efferent locations of modulation by trauma. For example, to identify asymmetry of afferent acute changes in the retina or optic nerve, the right and left pupil NPI may be averaged for the right eye stimulus and compared to the left eye stimulus. Similarly, to identify efferent acute changes along the parasympathetic or sympathetic nerve pathways, the right eye pupil responses may be averaged for the right and left eye stimuli, and left pupil responses will be averaged for the right and left eye stimuli. For centrally mediated changes in NPI, all four determinations may be averaged together for each time point. Saccade-Tracking: Saccades are fast, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction for the purpose of acquiring an object of interest onto the highest resolving portion of the retina, the fovea. These movements are used to re-fixate on particular objects as the eyes naturally drift, but also to integrate perspective and depth into a scene using binocular viewing. Saccades may be categorized into four main types: visually-guided, memory-guided, predictive, and anti-saccades. Visually-guided saccades move toward a stimulus and may be further bifurcated into self-paced or reflexive movements. Memory-guided saccades do not use a visual stimulus, but rather a memorized stimulus position. Predictive saccades are induced while eyes are tracking a regularly moving object. Anti-saccades are the conscious movement in the opposite direction of a visual stimulus. Damage to specific brain regions have been shown to correlate to a particular type of saccade dysfunction. During self-paced saccades testing, subjects are directed to shift eye direction between two targets as rapidly as possible. Lights appear simultaneously on the screen and the patient is asked to shift their gaze between the two lights as fast as possible. The system then measures the saccade speed and synchrony along with several other measures including accuracy. If the right and left eyes move at different rates or display other disparities it may also be an indicator of an injury. Studies report fairly strong statistical significance in the number of self-paced saccades between mTBI and control groups (p=0.003 for Heitger et al., 2004; p=0.0016 for Jacobs et al., 2012). Overall, evidence suggests measuring absolute number of saccades during a self-paced test is an acceptable and rapid approach to screen suspected mTBI patients. Visually-Guided Saccades: For visually-guided saccades, the system presents a visual stimulus, i.e., turns on one or more LEDs. The system then tracks the movement and position of the user's pupils. A number of studies have reported statistically significant differences in visually-guided saccades parameters for brain-injured groups of mixed severity (Capo-Aponte et al., 2012b; Castro et al., 2012; Heitger et al., 2002; Heitger et al., 2004). Other tested saccade parameters were not significantly different in two additional studies (Heitger et al., 2005 and Kraus et al., 2007). Memory-Guided Saccades: In a memory guided saccade, the system prompts the user to move his or her eyes to a remembered point, such as the center of the screen, without presenting a visual stimulus. Crevits et al. (2000) reported no significant differences for percent error and latency parameters of memory-guided saccades between intoxicated mTBI patients and control participants. Conversely, Heitger et al. (2006) reported significant differences in directional errors and absolute position errors up to six months post-traumatic brain injury. Significance levels are highest close to the time of injury (p<0.01 at one week; p<0.05 at 6 months). Anti-Saccade Testing: For this test, the system presents a stimulus at a random location on the edge of the screen. The individual is asked to look in the opposite direction to an imagined location at the same distance from center as the emitted light. This test requires significant cognitive control and may be highly sensitive to mild brain injuries. While Crevits et al. (2000) reported no statistically significant differences between groups in regard to anti-saccade percent error and latency, the Heitger et al. (2006) study reported latency and absolute positional error abnormalities lasting up to one week and three months post-injury, respectively. Kraus et al. (2007) also reported statistically significant measures of antisaccades (p values ranging from <0.05-0.01), but not gap latency in a sample of mTBI patients. Smooth Pursuit Eye Tracking with Error Correction: For this task, the system moves a stimulus across the display at various rates. The individual is instructed to follow the stimulus across the screen. The stimulus can move in any direction. Smooth pursuit eye movements allow the direction of gaze to closely track slowly moving targets. Pursuit of targets moving with velocities greater than thirty degrees/second tends to require catch-up saccades to maintain the position of gaze on the moving target. In contrast, targets moving with velocities less than thirty degrees/second provide for smooth pursuit eye movements that require the coordination of many neural systems that are localized to distinctly different areas of the brain. This diverse neural circuitry makes the smooth pursuit cortical network particularly susceptible to impairment from a variety of disorders and conditions. Error correction is then added with this task. The light moves in a predictable pattern then at a random point in time the direction of the pattern is reversed. The amount of time it takes for a user to correctly track the lights moving in the new direction is then measured. In addition to potentially detecting traumatic brain damage, the smooth pursuit system has been shown to be an indicator of abnormal clinical states including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), drug and alcohol abuse, and psychotic symptoms. Capo-Aponte et al. (2012b) measured a series of eye movement types using conventional eye exam methods in blast-injured patients and controls and found smooth pursuit to be the second most accurate measure to differentiate the two groups (p<0.001). However, the smooth pursuit measure was an “expert rater” scale of smooth pursuit determined by a clinician (Northeastern State University College of Optometry Oculomotor Test), which does not appear to have been validated and the clinician was not masked to the study. Hellerstein et al. (1995) reported smooth pursuit deficiencies using the Southern California College of Optometry (SCCO) technique (p=0.001, Fischer's Test), but not every patient in either mTBI or control groups were assessed. Similarly, Maruta et al. (2010) reported significant differences for intra-individual gaze positional error variability and not horizontal for vertical gains or mean phase of error. The Suh et al. studies (2006a and 2006b) reported that predictive smooth pursuit testing during target blanking is a sensitive indicator of injury leading to attentional and other cognitive deficits. Multiple parameters were reported as statistically different between groups. Critical Flicker Fusion: The critical flicker fusion test uses four or more LEDs at the corners of the display. All LEDS are flashing at high frequencies that fuse for humans (being perceived as a constant non-flickering light), such as above 40 Hz. The individual is then asked to look at the specific LED that starts perceptibly flashing. The system then randomly reduces the frequency at one of the LEDs that is flickered. When the individual detects the change in the emitted light flicker rate and directs their gaze at that light, the system detects the saccade to that position. The system may run this test several times using adaptive tracking to hone in on the critical flicker fusion frequency. FIG. 1 shows examples of raw data captured from two cameras that simultaneously track the pupil diameter and gaze direction during slow and fast movements. FIG. 1A shows an infrared eye image with a circle tracking the pupil diameter, and a point marking the pupil centroid. FIG. 1B shows changes in pupil diameters as the NeuroTriage system turns on and off the low intensity white LEDs in the headset. FIG. 1C shows the raw data of the system tracking both pupils during repeated saccadic testing; the eye movements are overlaid on three visual targets. FIG. 1D shows pupil tracking during the smooth pursuit task as right and left eyes track a light moving from left to right. The inventors have demonstrated that pupillary reflex responses are sensitive markers of acute brain trauma. A recent pilot study validated the usefulness of the NPI as an acute biomarker of more serious TBI and was correlated with indicies of neurological outcome (data not shown). The NPI incorporates a z-scale sum of pupil size, iris mechanics, contraction amplitude, latency, contraction velocity, and dilation velocity from the normal population. The NPI was recorded in 128 patients being evaluated for acute TBI in the University of Iowa Emergency Treatment Center. An abnormal NPI was predictive of outcome and seriousness of acute traumatic brain injury. Specifically, patients with an NPI≦3 (compared to patients with NPI>3) were found to have a significant likelihood of: 1) worse Glascow Coma Scale, 2) cranial CT scan abnormalities, 3) need for neurosurgical intervention, 4) longer length of hospitalization, and 5) need for skilled care after discharge. These results showed that the NPI is a promising biomarker of acute brain trauma that is predictive of outcome and in need of further evaluation.
