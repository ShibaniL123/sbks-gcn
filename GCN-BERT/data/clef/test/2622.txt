BACKGROUND ART Generally, low and intermediate level radioactive waste generated in the nuclear power plants and nuclear reactor facilities includes spent filter radioactive wastes produced in HVAC. This spent filter radioactive wastes include stainless steel or aluminum material of frame, and filter of which contents have glass fiber and/or aluminum foil as filter media. To dispose the spent filter radioactive wastes, after the metal frame and filter contents are separated, the metal frame is subject to decontamination and post-treatment, and glass fiber and aluminum foil may be pressed for drum-packaging. However, the drum-packaging disposal have been decided as inappropriate because there is a possibility of explosion on packaging and concern of generation of hydrogen gas (Al+2NaOH→½Al2O3+Na2O+H2) in the disposal site after packaging. Thus stable disposal method for them is needed.

Technical Solution To achieve the object of the invention, the vitrification process method of aluminum and filter radioactive wastes comprise mixing the aluminum and filter radioactive wastes with the frit in an induction heating low temperature melting furnace and meting it at the temperature of 1,100˜1,200° C. to produce glass solidification. Advantageous Effects As described above, the vitrification process method of aluminum and filter radioactive wastes according to this invention has the effects as follows: First, the present invention has the advantages of stably confining into glass structure the aluminum and radioactive materials contained in the aluminum and filter radioactive wastes, which are generated after the filter having aluminum foil and glass fiber disposes contaminants or pollutants in HVAC. Specifically the final glass solidification can not only reduce the volume of the wastes but also satisfy the acceptance criteria of disposal site for domestic low and intermediate level radioactive wastes. Second, since the present invention have simplified the method of applying waste input rate by using the development of frit for vitrification of the aluminum and filter radioactive wastes generated in the nuclear power plants and nuclear reactor facilities and mixing the wastes with the frit, it become possible to develop appropriate glass composition according to the changes in physical and chemical properties to maintain viscosity suitable for keeping operation integrity of CCIM, and to produce high quality of glass solidification fit for legislations and rules as vitrification final product.
