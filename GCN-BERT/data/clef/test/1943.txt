CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/983,864, filed on Apr. 24, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to exercise garments, and more particularly to exercise pants comprising affixed exercise resistance bands on each leg portion of the garment, and methods of using the same. BACKGROUND Various special exercise garments have been made to provide isometric exercising for the legs and arms. These garments are generally specialty garments that are worn for the purpose of aerobic exercises only and generally have resistance bands sewn into the garments mainly down the arms and legs. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,074, includes bands that encircle the legs from the hips to the ankle, or in the case of short pants, from the waist to the end of the pants. Other garments have pockets or channels in the garment itself to allow a resistance band to slide into the pockets or channels during exercising and removed after exercising as in U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,014. Other devices, U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,701 and 2,097,376, use bands that encircle the waist, ankles and wrists with elastic straps between the bands. The devices are cumbersome and are not suitable for wearing when not exercising. Individual stretchable exercise resistance bands that are not attached to clothing are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,819,177, 4,815,731 and 5,357,637. These devices are used primarily for exercising the muscles of the legs in conjunction with exercise pant garments or a more casual, everyday pant but do not allow for spontaneity because the stretchable exercise resistance bands are not permanently attached to the pant garment and must be carried with you to perform exercises for the lower body and then removed and stored when not in use. U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,546 relates to an exercise suit with form fitting pants and a pullover top made of a stretchable material having reinforcing segments with helically wound leg and arm resistance bands attached integrally to the suit. While such garments may have been satisfactory for certain situations they offer limited resistance to tone muscles and generally could not be casually worn while performing normal daily activities. Therefore, it would be desirable to have an exercise garment that is comfortable to wear and/or provides sufficient muscle toning. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,600, the leg portion of the device has an elastic resistance web that may be permanently attached to one leg, or completely removable, and is anchored to the opposing leg by means of hooks/loops or other types of fasteners to perform exercises for the lower body. This device does not allow the user to train the muscles of the lower body, more precisely the buttocks or inner thighs, one leg at a time since it is not intended to be affixed to a stationary object. Also, the resistance may only be increased or decreased by having to have additional resistant webs with various tensions. Furthermore, this also prevents the user from exercising the muscles of the inner thigh. SUMMARY A exercise pant garment may generally comprise an upwardly disposed waist, a seat spaced apart from and connected to a pant front, the seat and the pant front connected to the waist, two spaced apart leg sections connected to the seat and the pant front, and an elongated fabric, exercise band coupled to each leg section, wherein the exercise band comprises a first free end, a second free end, and a portion between the first and second free ends permanently fixed about a knee area of the leg section of the exercise pant garment, wherein the first and/or second free end of the exercise band has a length sufficient to attach to the first and/or second free end of the exercise band of the other leg section and/or a stationary object to provide sufficient resistance to the movement of the legs away from each other to stimulate muscles of the lower body during a resistance exercise program. A method of performing an exercise program wherein a user does a primary exercise involving repeated side to side movement of the user's legs may generally comprise providing an exercise pant garment comprising an upwardly disposed waist, a seat spaced apart from and connected to a pant front, the seat and the pant front connected to the waist, two spaced apart leg sections connected to the seat and the pant front, and a pair of elongated fabric, exercise resistance bands each having first and second free ends and coupled about a knee area of one of the leg sections of the exercise pant garment, wherein the first and/or second free end of the exercise band has a length sufficient to attach to the first and/or second free end of the exercise band of the other leg section and/or a stationary object to provide sufficient resistance to the movement of the legs away from each other to stimulate muscles of the lower body during a resistance exercise program.

The present invention relates to exercise garments and more particularly to exercise pants that offer a method for providing muscle conditioning when employing the affixed exercise resistance bands on each leg portion of the garment to perform a number of toning exercises for the muscles of lower body. The present invention may provide a supplemental exercise resistance program for the muscles of the lower body primarily the buttocks and inner thighs in an automatic manner as a result of the movement of the legs moving further apart during specific exercises of a resistance exercise program or further apart when the legs are used independent of each other for the muscles of the lower body primarily the adductors or inner thighs as a result of the movement of the legs moving further or closer together when exercising both legs at the same time or individually, when secured to a stationary object, during specific resistance exercises. The present invention may provide an exercise pant garment which is capable of providing the supplementary resistance exercises to a main resistance program. The present invention may provide such an exercise garment which requires minimal modifications to normal garment technology and that the invention itself is inconspicuous when formed to itself during periods of non-use. The present invention may provide such an exercise garment which is capable of being modified to vary the degree of resistance encountered during the supplemental exercise program. The exercise garment may be used for providing resistance during specific leg movements found in distinct resistance exercises for the lower body such as lateral band walk, standing adduction, standing abduction, supinated clamshell, supine glute bridge, seated abduction, laying leg scissors, etc. Where it is intended to provide resistance to the movement of the legs, the pant garment would include two leg sections that extend to at least about the knee area and have a fabric-like, exercise, resistance band, with first and second ends, permanently affixed to the end of each leg section at the inseam and hem. The resistance bands would be interconnected and span the distance of the leg sections and made of an elastic material that is stretchable and resilient that when the legs are moved further away from each other resistance is encountered causing the material to stretch. The material would then tend to resume its normal unstretched condition as the legs move back towards each other. Each exercise resistance band is permanently attached to each leg section of the pant garment and can be formed to each leg section and out of the way during periods of non-use so that the garment could be worn during other resistance programs, aerobic activities or during periods of non-exercise, everyday activities. The present invention may provide such an exercise garment which is capable of offering varying degrees of resistance during a supplemental exercise program quickly and without having to make any modifications to the garment itself. An exercise pant garment may generally comprise an upwardly disposed waist, a seat spaced apart from and connected to a pant front, the seat and the pant front connected to the waist, two spaced apart leg sections connected to the seat and the pant front, and an elongated fabric, exercise band coupled to each leg section, wherein the exercise band comprises a first free end, a second free end, and a portion between the first and second free ends permanently fixed about a knee area of the leg section of the exercise pant garment, wherein the first and/or second free end of the exercise band independently comprise a length sufficient to extend around the knee area and attach to the first and/or second free end of the exercise band of the other leg section, spanning the space between the leg sections to provide sufficient resistance to the movement of the legs away from each other to stimulate muscles of the lower body during a resistance exercise program, and/or a length sufficient to couple to a stationary object, spanning the space between the leg section and stationary object to provide sufficient resistance to the movement of the leg away from the stationary object to stimulate muscles of the lower body during a resistance exercise program. The length and/or resistance of each free end may be the same or different. The exercise band is permanently fixed to each leg section at the middle of the exercise band has a length sufficient to wrap around the leg section to securely mount the exercise band to the leg section during periods of non-use. The exercise band may comprise at least one spring loaded locking canister to fixedly connect the first and/or second free end of the exercise band to the first and/or second free end of the other exercise band during periods of use. The exercise band may comprise at least one snap to fixedly connect the first and/or second free end of the exercise band to the first and/or second free end of the other exercise band during periods of use. The exercise band may comprise at least one buckle to fixedly connect the first and/or second free end of the exercise band to the first and/or second free end of the other exercise band during periods of use. The exercise band may comprise at least one hook and loop type fastener to fixedly connect the first and/or second free end of the exercise band to the first and/or second free end of the other exercise band during periods of use. The exercise band may comprise a locking mechanism on the second free end to connect to one of the first free end, the other exercise band, or a stationary object. The first and/or second free end of the exercise band is coupled to the first and/or second free end of the other exercise band during periods of use. The exercise band may comprise variable resistance level. The exercise band may comprise a plurality of fasteners sewn into the exercise band and evenly spaced along the first free end of the exercise band to provide a variable resistance level to increase or decrease the resistance. The fastener may comprise a button. The exercise pant garment may comprise non-detachable resistance bands on each leg, the resistance bands may be wrapped around each leg section and pulled through the locking mechanism during periods of non-use. A method of performing an exercise program wherein a user does a primary exercise involving repeated side to side movement of the user's legs may generally comprise providing an exercise pant garment comprising an upwardly disposed waist, a seat spaced apart from and connected to a pant front, the seat and the pant front connected to the waist, two spaced apart leg sections connected to the seat and the pant front, and a pair of elongated fabric, exercise resistance bands each having first and second free ends and coupled about a knee area of one of the leg sections of the exercise pant garment, wherein the first and/or second free end of the exercise band independently comprise a length sufficient to extend around the knee area and attach to the first and/or second free end of the exercise band of the other leg section, spanning the space between the leg sections to provide sufficient resistance to the movement of the legs away from each other to stimulate muscles of the lower body during a resistance exercise program, and/or a length sufficient to couple to a stationary object, spanning the space between the leg section and stationary object to provide sufficient resistance to the movement of the leg away from the stationary object to stimulate muscles of the lower body during a resistance exercise program. The length and/or resistance of each free end may be the same or different. The method may comprise providing resistance to the user's moving legs by the exercise band stretching and resisting the movement of the user's legs when the exercise resistance bands are connected to each other and are relatively moved away from each other or to a stationary object and the legs moving away from each other or closer together. The method may comprise providing resistance along a length of the user's moving legs directly across the space between the leg sections or the space between a stationary object and the legs when each leg is used independent of the other. The method may comprise returning the exercise resistance bands to its unstretched condition when the exercise resistance bands are connected to each other and are relatively moved toward each other. The method may comprise returning the exercise resistance bands to its unstretched condition when the exercise resistance band is connected to a stationary object and the “working” leg is moved further away from the opposing leg and closer to the stationary object. The method may comprise repeating the stretching and resisting and returning of the exercise resistance bands by repeated side to side leg movements. The method of claim 12, wherein each exercise band is permanently fixed about the knee area of each leg section, and each exercise band comprises a locking mechanism on the second free end to connect both exercise resistance bands to each other or to a stationary object, and the first free end of each exercise band comprises a variable resistance level to increase or decrease the resistance. FIG. 1 illustrates the side view of the right leg of an exercise pant garment 10, that ends just below the knee, or longer, with a fabric-like, elastic exercise resistance band 11, having first and second ends, formed to the leg, with a possible length of enough to be wrapped around the wearer's leg at least once, and the first end pulled through the locking canister 12, attached to the second end, in an inconspicuous, fashionable, wearable manner when going about your everyday schedule and performing daily errands. FIG. 2 illustrates the side view of the right leg of an exercise pant garment 10, that ends just below the knee, or longer, with a fabric-like, elastic exercise resistance band 11, having first and second ends, formed to the leg by way of wrapping the exercise band 11, completely around the wearer's leg and then pulling the remaining length through the locking canister 12, in an inconspicuous, fashionable, wearable manner for going about your everyday schedule and performing daily errands. FIG. 3 illustrates the side view of the right leg of an exercise pant garment 10, with the resistance band 11, unformed and sewn only halfway around the leg section at the hem and the top of the resistance band 13, leaving enough of the resistance band free to provide enough give and resistance when formed to the resistance band on the opposing leg or stationary object, with the locking canister 12, on the second end of the resistance band and the varied resistance knots or button backs 14, evenly spaced and sewn along the first end of the resistance band. FIG. 4 illustrates the side view of the left leg of an exercise pant garment 10, with the exercise resistance band 11, unformed and the stitching of the band into the leg section only halfway around the leg at the hem and top of the resistance band 13, and the locking canister 12, on the second end of the resistance band. FIG. 5 illustrates the front view of the exercise pant garment 10, with both exercise resistance bands 11, unformed from each leg section and formed together by way of the locking canister 12, on the second ends of both resistance bands. FIG. 6 illustrates the front view of the exercise pant garment 10, with both exercise resistance bands 11, unformed from each leg section and formed together by way of the locking canister 12, on the second ends of both resistance bands with the wearer laying on their side to perform resistance exercises primarily for the muscles of the buttocks. FIG. 7 illustrates the resistance band 11, unformed from the left leg section of the exercise garment 10, and formed to a stationary object 14, by way of pulling the first end of the resistance band through the locking canister 12, located on the second end of the resistance band to perform resistance exercises for the muscles of the lower body one leg at a time. The present invention is based upon the recognition that a resistance exercise program for the lower body can be supplemented by means of resistance exercises outside the use of traditional resistance machines. More particularly, the invention provides added resistance to proven body-weight driven leg movement exercises geared to toning the muscles of the lower body by making use of a pant garment which incorporates modified structures to provide this added resistance. In general, the modified structures are resistance bands permanently attached about the knee area to each leg section of an exercise pant garment and when the resistance bands are formed together, they provide resistance to the muscles of the lower body as the legs move further away from each other while performing various lower body resistance exercises, or one end of the resistance bands may be connected to a stationary object to train the muscles of the lower body one leg at a time when that leg is moved further away from the stationary object. The elongated diamond like shaped resistance bands are a fabric-like, elastic, resilient material, with a possible combination of nylon, lycra, latex, spandex, polyester and or rubber, having first and second ends, attached to the end of each leg section at the middle of the band and with enough length to wrap around the wearer's leg at least once and be able to form to the resistance band on the opposing leg and still offer enough give and resistance to stimulate the muscles of the lower body while performing various lower body resistance exercises. The resistance bands on each leg section are of at least a width of 0.125 to 5 inches, such as 2.5 inches, starting from the middle of the band, where it is affixed to the pant garment, and narrowing evenly out on the second end for the locking canister to be fixed to it and out on the first end, to be small enough to fit through the locking canister as well as the button backs or knots sewn into the first end used to vary the resistance and prevent the band from slipping through the locking canister during maximum resistance. The exercise pant garment is at least a knee length, or longer, exercise pant garment made of a suitable elastic, stretchable, resilient material such as lycra, spandex and or nylon blend or a more relaxed fitting hiking or sweat pant with a possible polyester, elastane, cotton blend. As previously noted, the length of each resistance band is of a length to at least wrap around the wearer's leg once and to allow the bands to be formed together, interconnecting both leg sections, and provide enough resistance to stimulate the muscles of the lower body, or to perform resistance exercises one leg at a time, formed to a stationary object, and allowing the muscles of the inner thigh to also be stimulated during specific adduction exercises. FIG. 7 shows how forming the resistance band on the left leg to a stationary object can offer muscle conditioning to the inner thigh of the left leg by moving the leg through a range of motion of increasing and decreasing distance between it and the right leg while tethered to the pole. The elastic exercise resistance bands attached to each leg section, have knots or button backs sewn into the first end of the resistance band, evenly spaced apart for increased or decreased resistance to avoid slipping of the bands when pulled through the spring loaded lock canister permanently sewn into the second end of the resistance band, with possible snaps, hook and loop or buckle type fasteners, during a resistance exercise activity. When not in use, the resistance bands can be formed to each pant leg by means of wrapping the band around the knee area and pulling the first end of the resistance band through the second end that has the locking canister on it, to keep the bands out of the way. FIG. 1 shows the resistance band tied into a small bow then pulled through the locking canister as opposed to FIG. 2 where the resistance band is wrapped entirely around the leg section and then pulled through the locking canister, giving the leg sections more of a lower profile look. In another embodiment, the exercise resistance bands could be removable to protect the integrity of the bands and the locking canisters especially from the wear and tear of washing machines. The resistance bands could be held in place with snaps, Velcro, hook and loop type fasteners or zippers instead of stitching the resistance bands directly to the exercise pant garment.
