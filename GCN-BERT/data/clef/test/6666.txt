GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP This invention was made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the United States Government. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to group C rotaviruses (GpC RV) and rotavirus-like particles, methods of producing immunogenic rotavirus-like particles, immunogenic compositions inclusive of rotavirus-like particles and methods for eliciting an immune response using compositions inclusive of rotavirus-like particles, as well as producing a diagnostic for rotavirus infection. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Rotaviruses are a diverse set of pathogens classified into groups A through G based on the distinct characteristics of the inner capsid protein, VP6. Among these, GpC RV has been identified as a pathogen in humans and attributed to outbreaks and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis worldwide in young children <3 years of age (8, 13, 15, 25, 26, 29, 30) and in older children and adults (2, 15, 20, 21, 25, 26, 30, 32). While some studies have reported low detection rates in children with diarrhea (1, 2, 4, 26, 29), seroprevalence studies have demonstrated that GpC RV is a commonplace pathogen with a much higher occurrence in adults (4, 6, 10, 20, 27, 31). One possible cause of low GpC RV detection is the unavailability of adequate diagnostic tools. While PCR is a frequently employed technique, it is often insensitive for diagnosis of GpC RV due to the instability of its capsid proteins and the degradation of its RNA genome. It is also not an accessible technique to many clinical laboratories that are involved in diagnostics of samples from patients with gastroenteritis. If a more practical and economical tool, like a GpC RV-specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA), was available, testing of large numbers of samples could be performed to better estimate GpC RV disease burden. Propagation of the Cowden strain, a prototype porcine GpC RV, has been successful and antibodies to this virus have been employed for GpC RV diagnostics (13, 28, 30, 33, 34). However their specificity and sensitivity to human GpC RV is questionable. Progress in the development of a sensitive and specific EIA for human GpC RV has been stunted by its fastidious growth in cell culture. To circumvent the prior art problems of GpC RV fastidious growth problem, VP6 from a human GpC RV was expressed in insect cells using the Baculovirus System and antibody to this recombinant protein was employed in seroprevalence studies (6, 11, 31). To the best of our knowledge, these reagents have not been utilized for viral detection in human specimens and their specificity to GpC RV remains questionable. GpC RV are a cause of acute gastroenteritis in children and adults that is distinct from group A RV. Human group A RV detection methods are well established and widely available while group C RV diagnostics are only available in a few reference laboratories. Since native human group C RV are unstable and cannot be grown in cell culture, reagents from animal group C RV have been used for diagnostics. However these diagnostic tools may not be sensitive or specific enough for human strains. Thus, sensitive and specific detection methods and reagents for human group C RV are not readily available. Consequently, the burden of GpC RV disease has not been clearly established. Thus, there exists a need for a human specific group C rotavirus diagnostic. There also exists a need for a human group C RV-like particle for use in such a diagnostic and for eliciting an immune response as a vaccine.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Group C rotavirus (GpC RV) is a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis in children and adults. Characterization of GpC RV has only been accomplished to date with porcine and bovine strains that can be grown in cell culture. Because human GpC RVs are unstable and cannot be cultivated in cell culture, reagents and sensitive and specific detection methods are not available. Consequently, the impact of GpC RV on diarrheal disease has not been clearly established. Demonstrated herein is the expression of the major inner and outer capsid human GpC proteins VP6 and VP7 and the human GpC core protein VP2 and the self-assembly of human GpC VP6/7 virus-like particles (VLPs) or human GpC VP2/6/7 VLPs. Antibodies to these human GpC RV VLPs show highly specific reactivities with the corresponding GpC but not GpA RV. The ability to produce large amounts of human GpC RV antigenic materials, such as human GpC RV proteins and VLPs, and the availability of high quality antibody reagents provide sensitive and specific diagnostic assays and provide tools for investigation of the epidemiology and disease burden of GpC RV in humans. The instant invention has numerous uses including, but not limited to, detection of human rotavirus C antibodies in biological samples, diagnosis of human rotavirus C infection, identification of individuals previously or currently infected with human rotavirus C, as an antigen for generation of antibodies and for the development of therapeutics for prophylaxis or treatment of disease associated with human rotavirus C infection. In accordance with the present invention, various techniques and terms including, but not limited to, conventional molecular biology, microbiology, immunology and recombinant DNA techniques and terms, may be used which are known by those of skill in the art.

Human Rotavirus C Virus-Like Particles Human rotavirus C virus-like particles (VLPs) are provided according to the present invention. The term “virus-like particle” refers to a capsid defining an internal space. The internal space defined by the capsid is “empty” of an intact human rotavirus C genome and the human rotavirus C VLPs of the present invention are therefore non-replicating and incapable of causing human rotavirus C-associated disease. Human rotavirus C VLPs include human rotavirus C VP6 and VP7 proteins according to embodiments of the present invention. In further embodiments of the present invention, human rotavirus C VLPs include human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 and VP7 proteins. Genes encoding human rotavirus C proteins VP2, VP6 and VP7 have been identified and sequenced. Any human Group C RV VP6 protein can be included in human rotavirus C VLPs of the present invention.

In another aspect, the invention provides a vector comprising the inventive nucleic acid molecules described herein. In another aspect, the invention provides an isolated host cell comprising one or more of the inventive vectors described herein. The inventive methods and compositions are not limited to the VP proteins and polypeptides having the amino acid sequence described herein in detail. Where appropriate, variants, such as homologs from other strains and groups, may be used. As used herein, the term “variant” defines either a naturally occurring genetic mutant of a human rotavirus C virus or a recombinantly prepared variation of a human rotavirus C virus, each of which contain one or more mutations in its genome compared to a reference human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 or VP7. The term “variant” may also refer to either a naturally occurring variation of a given peptide or a recombinantly prepared variation of a given peptide or protein in which one or more amino acid residues have been modified by amino acid substitution, addition, or deletion. Preferred are human rotavirus C proteins having at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identity to SEQ ID No. 1, SEQ ID No.32 or SEQ ID No. 34. Further preferred are human rotavirus C proteins having 99% or greater identity to SEQ ID No. 1, SEQ ID No.32 or SEQ ID No.34. Mutations can be introduced using standard molecular biology techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. One of skill in the art will recognize that one or more amino acid mutations can be introduced without altering the functional properties of the human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 or VP7 proteins. It is also recognized by one of ordinary skilled in the art that VP protein and polypeptide variants encompass conservative amino acid substitutions in the amino acid sequences of the VP proteins and polypeptides set forth in detail herein. Conservative amino acid substitutions can be made in human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 or VP7 proteins to produce human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 or VP7 protein variants. Conservative amino acid substitutions are art recognized substitutions of one amino acid for another amino acid having similar characteristics. For example, each amino acid may be described as having one or more of the following characteristics: electropositive, electronegative, aliphatic, aromatic, polar, hydrophobic and hydrophilic. A conservative substitution is a substitution of one amino acid having a specified structural or functional characteristic for another amino acid having the same characteristic. Acidic amino acids include aspartate, glutamate; basic amino acids include histidine, lysine, arginine; aliphatic amino acids include isoleucine, leucine and valine; aromatic amino acids include phenylalanine, glycine, tyrosine and tryptophan; polar amino acids include aspartate, glutamate, histidine, lysine, asparagine, glutamine, arginine, serine, threonine and tyrosine; and hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, cysteine, phenylalanine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, proline, valine and tryptophan; and conservative substitutions include substitution among amino acids within each group. Amino acids may also be described in terms of relative size, alanine, cysteine, aspartate, glycine, asparagine, proline, threonine, serine, valine, all typically considered to be small. Human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 or VP7 variants can include synthetic amino acid analogs, amino acid derivatives and/or non-standard amino acids, illustratively including, without limitation, alpha-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, canavanine, cyanoalanine, diaminobutyric acid, diaminopimelic acid, dihydroxy-phenylalanine, djenkolic acid, homoarginine, hydroxyproline, norleucine, norvaline, 3-phosphoserine, homoserine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine, and ornithine. In addition, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, more than one nucleic acid will encode an identical protein. Thus, nucleic acids encoding the VP proteins and polypeptides or a variant thereof are not limited to those nucleic acids described herein in detail. Variants of VP proteins and polypeptides having 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% homology to the amino acid sequence described herein in detail are operable in the described methods and compositions. Variants of nucleic acids having 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% homology to the nucleotide sequence described herein in detail are operable in the described methods and compositions. “Homology” refers to sequence similarity or, alternatively, sequence identity, between two or more polynucleotide sequences or two or more polypeptide sequences. The terms “percent identity” and “% identity”, as applied to polynucleotide sequences, refer to the percentage of identical nucleotide matches between at least two polynucleotide sequences aligned using a standardized algorithm. Such an algorithm may insert, in a standardized and reproducible way, gaps in the sequences being compared in order to optimize alignment between two sequences, and therefore achieve a more meaningful comparison of the two sequences. Percent identity between polynucleotide sequences may be determined using one or more computer algorithms or programs known in the art or described herein. For example, percent identity can be determined using the default parameters of the CLUSTAL V algorithm as incorporated into the MEGALIGN version 3.12e sequence alignment program. This program is part of the LASERGENE software package, a suite of molecular biological analysis programs (DNASTAR, Madison Wis.). CLUSTAL V is described in Higgins, D. G. and P. M. Sharp (1989; CABIOS 5:151-153) and in Higgins, D. G. et al. (1992; CABIOS 8:189-191). For pairwise alignments of polynucleotide sequences, the default parameters are set as follows: Ktuple=2, gap penalty=5, window=4, and “diagonals saved”=4. The “weighted” residue weight table is selected as the default. Alternatively, a suite of commonly used and freely available sequence comparison algorithms which can be used is provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (Altschul, S. F. et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410), which is available from several sources, including the NCBI, Bethesda, Md., and on the NCBI World Wide Web site available on the Internet. The BLAST software suite includes various sequence analysis programs including “blastn,” that is used to align a known polynucleotide sequence with other polynucleotide sequences from a variety of databases. Also available is a tool called “BLAST 2 Sequences” that is used for direct pairwise comparison of two nucleotide sequences. “BLAST 2 Sequences” can be accessed and used interactively on the Internet via the NCBI World Wide Web site as well. The “BLAST 2 Sequences” tool can be used for both blastn and blastp (discussed below). BLAST programs are commonly used with gap and other parameters set to default settings. For example, to compare two nucleotide sequences, one may use blastn with the “BLAST 2 Sequences” tool Version 2.0.12 (Apr. 21, 2000) set at default parameters. Such default parameters may be, for example: Matrix:BLOSUM62; Reward for match: 1; Penalty for mismatch: −2; Open Gap: 5 and Extension Gap: 2 penalties; Gap x drop-off: 50; Expect: 10; Word Size: 11; Filter: on. Percent identity may be measured over the length of an entire defined sequence, for example, as defined by a particular SEQ ID number, or may be measured over a shorter length, for example, over the length of a fragment taken from a larger, defined sequence, for instance, a fragment of at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 70, at least 100, or at least 200 contiguous nucleotides. Such lengths are exemplary only, and it is understood that any fragment length supported by the sequences shown herein, in the tables, figures, or sequence listing, may be used to describe a length over which percentage identity may be measured. The phrases “percent identity” and “% identity”, as applied to polypeptide sequences, refer to the percentage of identical residue matches between at least two polypeptide sequences aligned using a standardized algorithm. Methods of polypeptide sequence alignment are well known. Some alignment methods take into account conservative amino acid substitutions. Such conservative substitutions, explained in more detail above, generally preserve the charge and hydrophobicity at the site of substitution, thus preserving the structure (and therefore function) of the polypeptide. The phrases “percent similarity” and “% similarity”, as applied to polypeptide sequences, refer to the percentage of residue matches, including identical residue matches and conservative substitutions, between at least two polypeptide sequences aligned using a standardized algorithm. In contrast, conservative substitutions are not included in the calculation of percent identity between polypeptide sequences. Percent identity between polypeptide sequences may be determined using the default parameters of the CLUSTAL V algorithm as incorporated into the MEGALIGN version 3.12e sequence alignment program (described and referenced above). For pairwise alignments of polypeptide sequences using CLUSTAL V, the default parameters are set as follows: Ktuple=1, gap penalty=3, window=5, and “diagonals saved”=5. The PAM250 matrix is selected as the default residue weight table. Alternatively the NCBI BLAST software suite may be used. For example, for a pairwise comparison of two polypeptide sequences, one may use the “BLAST 2 Sequences” tool Version 2.0.12 (Apr. 21, 2000) with blastp set at default parameters. Such default parameters may be, for example: Matrix: BLOSUM62; Open Gap: 11 and Extension Gap: 1 penalties; Gap x drop-off: 50; Expect: 10; Word Size: 3; Filter: on. Percent identity may be measured over the length of an entire defined polypeptide sequence, for example, as defined by a particular SEQ ID number, or may be measured over a shorter length, for example, over the length of a fragment taken from a larger, defined polypeptide sequence, for instance, a fragment of at least 15, at least 20, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 70 or at least 150 contiguous residues. Such lengths are exemplary only, and it is understood that any fragment length supported by the sequences shown herein, in the tables, figures or sequence listing, may be used to describe a length over which percentage identity may be measured. Furthermore, fragments of the proteins and polypeptides and variants thereof are encompassed in the methods and compositions of the invention, so long as the fragment is operable in effecting the relevant biological activity as understood by the ordinarily skilled artisan. Thus, for example, fragments include fragments of VP2 proteins and polypeptides; where the fragment is contained in a virus-like particle when expressed in an insect cell culture along with a VP6 and VP7 protein or polypeptide, or a variant or fragment thereof. Thus, for example, fragments include fragments of VP6 proteins and polypeptides; where the fragment is contained in a virus-like particle when expressed in an insect cell culture along with a VP7 protein or polypeptide, or a variant or fragment thereof. Thus, for example, fragments include fragments of VP7 proteins and polypeptides; where the fragment is contained in a virus-like particle when expressed in an insect cell culture along with a VP6 protein or polypeptide, or a variant or fragment thereof. Fragments also encompass those fragments which effect an immunogenic response as described herein for a VP protein, polypeptide or a variant there. Processes for Making VLPs VP2 core protein and the VP6 and VP7 capsid proteins and polypeptides (VP proteins and polypeptides) described in the compositions and methods described herein can be generated by recombinant methods, such as the inventive methods described herein, or by suitable expression methods known to the ordinarily skilled artisan where appropriate. Nucleic acid sequences encoding the VP proteins and polypeptides are isolated as exemplified by nucleic acid sequences described herein. VLPs are produced using recombinant nucleic acid technology according to embodiments of the present invention. VLP production includes introducing a recombinant expression vector encompassing a DNA sequence encoding human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 and/or VP7 into a host cell. Specific nucleic acid sequences encoding human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 or VP7 introduced into a host cell to produce human rotavirus C VLPs are It is appreciated that due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, alternate nucleic acid sequences encode human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 or VP7 and variants thereof, and that such alternate nucleic acids may be included in an expression vector and expressed to produce human rotavirus C VLPs of the present invention. In embodiments of the present invention, a nucleic acid sequence which is substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 31, SEQ ID NO: 46, or SEQ ID No. 48 encoding human rotavirus GpC VP6, is included in an expression vector and expressed to produce human rotavirus C VLPs of the present invention. In further embodiments of the present invention, a nucleic acid sequence which is substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 33 encoding human rotavirus GpC VP7, is included in an expression vector and expressed to produce human rotavirus C VLPs of the present invention. In further embodiments of the present invention, a nucleic acid sequence which is substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 18, SEQ ID No. 42 or SEQ ID No. 43 encoding human rotavirus GpC VP2, is included in an expression vector and expressed to produce human rotavirus C VLPs of the present invention. A nucleic acid sequence which is substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 31 or SEQ ID NO: 46 is characterized as having a complementary nucleic acid sequence capable of hybridizing to SEQ ID No. 31, SEQ ID NO: 46, or SEQ ID No. 48 under high stringency hybridization conditions. Similarly, a nucleic acid sequence which is substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 33, SEQ ID No. 18, SEQ ID No. 42 or SEQ ID No. 43, is characterized as having a complementary nucleic acid sequence capable of hybridizing to SEQ ID No. 33 or SEQ ID No. 18, SEQ ID No. 42 or SEQ ID No. 43, respectively, under high stringency hybridization conditions. The term “nucleic acid” refers to RNA or DNA molecules having more than one nucleotide in any form including single-stranded, double-stranded, oligonucleotide or polynucleotide. The term “nucleotide sequence” refers to the ordering of nucleotides in an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide in a single-stranded form of nucleic acid. The term “complementary” refers to Watson-Crick base pairing between nucleotides and specifically refers to nucleotides hydrogen bonded to one another with thymine or uracil residues linked to adenine residues by two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine residues linked by three hydrogen bonds. In general, a nucleic acid includes a nucleotide sequence described as having a “percent complementarity” to a specified second nucleotide sequence. For example, a nucleotide sequence may have 80%, 90%, or 100% complementarity to a specified second nucleotide sequence, indicating that 8 of 10, 9 of 10 or 10 of 10 nucleotides of a sequence are complementary to the specified second nucleotide sequence. For instance, the nucleotide sequence 3′-TCGA-5′ is 100% complementary to the nucleotide sequence 5′-AGCT-3′. Further, the nucleotide sequence 3′-TCGA- is 100% complementary to a region of the nucleotide sequence 5′-TTAGCTGG-3′. The terms “hybridization” and “hybridizes” refer to pairing and binding of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization occurs to varying extents between two nucleic acids depending on factors such as the degree of complementarity of the nucleic acids, the melting temperature, Tm, of the nucleic acids and the stringency of hybridization conditions, as is well known in the art. The term “stringency of hybridization conditions” refers to conditions of temperature, ionic strength, and composition of a hybridization medium with respect to particular common additives such as formamide and Denhardt's solution. Determination of particular hybridization conditions relating to a specified nucleic acid is routine and is well known in the art, for instance, as described in J. Sambrook and D. W. Russell, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 3rd Ed., 2001; and F. M. Ausubel, Ed., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, Current Protocols; 5th Ed., 2002. High stringency hybridization conditions are those which only allow hybridization of substantially complementary nucleic acids. Typically, nucleic acids having about 85-100% complementarity are considered highly complementary and hybridize under high stringency conditions. Intermediate stringency conditions are exemplified by conditions under which nucleic acids having intermediate complementarity, about 50-84% complementarity, as well as those having a high degree of complementarity, hybridize. In contrast, low stringency hybridization conditions are those in which nucleic acids having a low degree of complementarity hybridize. The terms “specific hybridization” and “specifically hybridizes” refer to hybridization of a particular nucleic acid to a target nucleic acid without substantial hybridization to nucleic acids other than the target nucleic acid in a sample. Stringency of hybridization and washing conditions depends on several factors, including the Tm of the probe and target and ionic strength of the hybridization and wash conditions, as is well-known to the skilled artisan. Hybridization and conditions to achieve a desired hybridization stringency are described, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001; and Ausubel, F. et al., (Eds.), Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley, 2002. An example of high stringency hybridization conditions is hybridization of nucleic acids over about 100 nucleotides in length in a solution containing 6×SSC, 5×Denhardt's solution, 30% formamide, and 100 micrograms/ml denatured salmon sperm at 37° C. overnight followed by washing in a solution of 0.1×SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60° C. for 15 minutes. SSC is 0.15M NaCl/0.015M Na citrate. Denhardt's solution is 0.02% bovine serum albumin/0.02% FICOLL/0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone. Under highly stringent conditions, SEQ ID No. 31, SEQ ID No. 33 and SEQ ID No. 18 will hybridize to the complement of substantially identical targets and not to unrelated sequences. The term “expression vector” refers to a recombinant vehicle for introducing a DNA sequence encoding one or more human rotavirus C proteins into a host cell where the DNA sequence is expressed to produce the one or more human rotavirus C proteins. In particular embodiments, a DNA sequence encoding one or more human rotavirus C proteins includes an open reading frame encoding the one or more human rotavirus C proteins. In further embodiments, 5′ non-coding sequence and/or 3′ non-coding sequence is present in addition to the open reading frame encoding the one or more human rotavirus C proteins. Preferably, where 5′ non-coding sequence and/or 3′ non-coding sequence is present, it is contiguous with the DNA sequence encoding one or more human rotavirus C proteins, 5′ non-coding sequence, if any, is positioned upstream (5′) of the start codon and 3′ non-coding sequence, if any, is positioned downstream (3′) of the stop codon. In particular embodiments, an expression vector including SEQ ID No. 42 or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence is expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP2 and self-assembled VLPs in cells containing the expression vector. SEQ ID No. 42 includes an open reading frame encoding human rotavirus C VP2 from strain Asp88. Optionally, 5′ non-coding sequence and/or 3′ non-coding sequence of human rotavirus C VP2 from strain Asp88 is included in the expression vector. For example, 1-36 nucleotides of 5′ non-coding sequence can be included contiguous with the 5′ end of the nucleotide sequence encoding human rotavirus C VP2 from strain Asp88. In particular embodiments, an expression vector including SEQ ID No. 18 or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence is expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP2 and self-assembled VLPs in cells containing the expression vector. In further embodiments, an expression vector including SEQ ID No. 43 or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence is expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP2 and self-assembled VLPs in cells containing the expression vector. In additional embodiments, an expression vector including SEQ ID No. 31, SEQ ID NO: 46, SEQ ID No. 48 or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence is expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP6 and self-assembled VLPs in cells containing the expression vector. In additional embodiments, an expression vector including SEQ ID No. 33, SEQ ID No. 45, or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence is expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP7 and self-assembled VLPs in cells containing the expression vector. In further embodiments, an expression vector including SEQ ID No. 31, SEQ ID NO: 46, SEQ ID No. 48 or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence and SEQ ID No. 33, SEQ ID No. 45, or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence is expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP6, human rotavirus C VP7 and self-assembled VLPs, in cells containing the expression vector. In further embodiments, an expression vector including SEQ ID No. 31, SEQ ID NO: 46, SEQ ID No. 48 or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence, SEQ ID No. 33, SEQ ID No. 45, or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence and SEQ ID No. 18, SEQ ID No. 42, SEQ ID No. 43, or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence is expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP6, human rotavirus C VP7, human rotavirus C VP2 and self-assembled VLPs in cells containing the expression vector. In still further embodiments, a first expression vector including SEQ ID No. 31, SEQ ID NO: 46, SEQ ID No. 48 or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence and a second expression vector including SEQ ID No. 33, SEQ ID No. 45, or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence are both expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP6, human rotavirus C VP7 and self-assembled VLPs in cells containing the expression vectors. In still further embodiments, a first expression vector including SEQ ID No.31, SEQ ID NO: 46, SEQ ID No. 48 or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence, a second expression vector including SEQ ID No. 33, SEQ ID No. 45, or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence and a third expression vector including SEQ ID No. 18, SEQ ID No. 42, SEQ ID No. 43, or a substantially identical nucleic acid sequence are expressed to produce human rotavirus C VP6, human rotavirus C VP7, human rotavirus C VP2, and self-assembled VLPs in cells containing the expression vectors. In addition to one or more DNA sequences encoding proteins of human rotavirus C, one or more DNA sequences encoding additional proteins can be included in an expression vector. For example, such additional proteins include non-human rotavirus C proteins such as reporters, including, but not limited to, beta-galactosidase, green fluorescent protein and antibiotic resistance reporters; and antigens. Expression vectors are known in the art and include plasmids and viruses, for example. An expression vector contains a DNA molecule that includes segment encoding a polypeptide of interest operably linked to one or more regulatory elements that provide for transcription of the segment encoding the polypeptide of interest. Such regulatory elements include, but are not limited to, promoters, terminators, enhancers, origins of replication and polyadenylation signals. In particular embodiments, the recombinant expression vector encodes human rotavirus C VP2 of SEQ ID No. 1, a protein having at least 95% identity to SEQ ID No. 1, a protein encoded by SEQ ID No. 42, or a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 42. In particular embodiments, the recombinant expression vector encodes human rotavirus C VP6 of SEQ ID No. 32, a protein having at least 95% identity to SEQ ID No. 32, a protein encoded by SEQ ID No. 31, or a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 31. In particular embodiments, the recombinant expression vector encodes human rotavirus C VP7 of SEQ ID No. 34, a protein having at least 95% identity to SEQ ID No. 34, a protein encoded by SEQ ID No. 33 or SEQ ID No. 45, or a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 33 or SEQ ID No. 45. In further embodiments, the recombinant expression vector encodes human rotavirus C VP6 of SEQ ID No. 32, a protein having at least 95% identity to SEQ ID No. 32, a protein encoded by SEQ ID No. 31, or a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 31; and human rotavirus C VP7 of SEQ ID No. 34, a protein having at least 95% identity to SEQ ID No. 34, a protein encoded by SEQ ID No. 33 or SEQ ID No. 45, or a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 33 or SEQ ID No. 45. A preferred expression vector of the present invention is a baculovirus. Expression of human rotavirus C VP2, VP6 and/or VP7 encoded by a recombinant expression vector is accomplished by introduction of the expression vector into a eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cell expression system such as an insect cell, mammalian cell, yeast cell, bacterial cell or any other single or multicellular organism recognized in the art. In preferred embodiments, a eukaryotic host cell is used. Host cells are optionally primary cells or immortalized derivative cells. Immortalized cells are those which can be maintained in-vitro for at least 5 replication passages. Host cells containing the recombinant expression vector are maintained under conditions where human rotavirus C proteins are produced. The human rotavirus C proteins self-associate to produce VLPs of the present invention in the host cell. The invention provides a host cell containing a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention. Host cells may be cultured and maintained using known cell culture techniques such as described in Celis, Julio, ed., 1994, Cell Biology Laboratory Handbook, Academic Press, N.Y. Various culturing conditions for these cells, including media formulations with regard to specific nutrients, oxygen, tension, carbon dioxide and reduced serum levels, can be selected and optimized by one of skill in the art. A preferred cell line of the present invention is a eukaryotic cell line, preferably an insect cell line, such as Sf9 or Hi5, transiently or stably expressing one or more full-length or partial human rotavirus C proteins. Such cells can be made by transfection (proteins or nucleic acid vectors), infection (viral vectors) or transduction (viral vectors). The cell lines for use in the present invention are cloned using known cell culture techniques familiar to one skilled in the art. The cells are cultured and expanded from a single cell using commercially available culture media under known conditions suitable for propagating cells. In a preferred embodiment human rotavirus C VLPs are produced by infection of a host cell with at least one recombinant baculovirus encoding human rotavirus C protein(s). It is appreciated that a single baculovirus may encode either a single human rotavirus C protein or multiple human rotavirus C proteins. The resulting infected cells are then cultured under conditions whereby the encoded human rotavirus C proteins from the respective recombinant baculoviruses are produced and self assemble to form the capsids. The resulting human rotavirus C VLPs are then optionally and preferably isolated. In further preferred embodiments, the recombinant baculovirus encodes at least human rotavirus C VP6 of SEQ ID No. 32, a protein having at least 95% identity to SEQ ID No. 32, a protein encoded by SEQ ID No. 31, or a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 31, SEQ ID NO: 46 or SEQ ID No. 48; and human rotavirus C VP7 of SEQ ID No. 34, a protein having at least 95% identity to SEQ ID No. 34, a protein encoded by SEQ ID No. 33 or SEQ ID No. 45, or a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 33 or SEQ ID No. 45. In a further option, the recombinant baculovirus encodes human rotavirus C VP2 of SEQ ID No. 1, a protein having at least 95% identity to SEQ ID No. 1, a protein encoded by SEQ ID No. 42, or a protein encoded by a nucleic acid sequence substantially identical to SEQ ID No. 42. Any suitable baculovirus known in the art is operable in the instant inventive process. Preferably, the baculovirus is Autographa california nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Processes for infecting cells with baculovirus are known in the art. Following infection of a host cell the inventive process proceeds by culturing the host cells under conditions such that protein(s) produced self assemble to form VLPs. A VLP of the present invention optionally includes a non-human rotavirus C protein or peptide in contact with or bonded to at least one of the human rotavirus C proteins VP2, VP6 or VP7. Bonding of the non-human rotavirus C protein or peptide is achieved, for example, by expression of a fusion construct including a nucleic acid sequence encoding VP2, VP6 or VP7 and the non-human rotavirus C protein or peptide. Thus, the non-human rotavirus C protein or peptide is optionally a fusion protein or peptide wherein the non-human rotavirus C protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain with a human rotavirus C structural protein. The non-human rotavirus C protein is optionally fused with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) for rapid isolation. A human rotavirus C protein is also optionally fused to GST. Chemical bonding methods are optionally used to bond a VLP and a non-human rotavirus C protein or peptide, illustratively including reaction using a cross-linking agent such as carbodiimide or glutaraldehyde. In particular embodiments, the non-human rotavirus C protein or peptide included in the VLP includes one or more antigenic epitopes such that the VLP serves to present the one or more antigenic epitopes to the immune system of a subject to induce antibody generation. In a further option, the non-human rotavirus C protein or peptide is a targeting moiety such as a receptor ligand or receptor. A targeting moiety is included in the VLP to direct the VLP to a target, such as to a particular cell type. Human rotavirus C VLPs produced in a host cell are optionally isolated. The term “isolated” in reference to a human rotavirus C VLP describes a human rotavirus C VLP which is separated from a cell in which the human rotavirus C VLP is produced and which is substantially free of host cell components not intended to be associated with the human rotavirus C VLP. Generally, human rotavirus C VLPs are separated from whole cell extracts of host cells. Numerous processes of isolating VLPs are known in the art and are applicable to isolation of human rotavirus C VLPs illustratively including sucrose continuous and discontinuous gradients, cesium chloride single and multi-density gradient centrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography, antigen capture chromatography, affinity chromatography, or other suitable process known in the art. An exemplary method for isolating human rotavirus C VLPs of the present invention is described in Gillock, ET. et al, 1997. J. Virol., 71:2857-2865. Human rotavirus C VLPs having different compositions, that is, different “types” of human rotavirus C VLPs are optionally present in a composition of the present invention. For example, human rotavirus C VLPs including human rotavirus C VP2 are optionally included in a composition with antigen presenting human rotavirus C VLPs including a non-human rotavirus C protein or peptide and/or human rotavirus C VLPs containing a cargo moiety. In one aspect, the invention provides a method of making a human group C rotavirus-like particle comprising: constructing a first baculovirus vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence encoding a human group C RV VP6 capsid protein operably linked to a baculovirus promoter that drives expression of said protein in an insect cell; constructing a second baculovirus vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence encoding a human group C RV VP7 capsid protein operably linked to a baculovirus promoter that drives expression of said protein in an insect cell; and infecting an insect cell culture with said first and second baculovirus vector under conditions that promote expression of the VP6- and VP7 capsid proteins. In one embodiment of the present invention, the method further comprises constructing a third baculovirus vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence encoding a human group C RV VP2 core protein operably linked to a baculovirus promoter that drives expression of said protein in an insect cell; and infecting an insect cell culture with said first, second, and third baculovirus vector under conditions that promote expression of the VP6 capsid protein and VP7 capsid protein and said VP2 core protein. In another aspect, the invention provides a rotavirus-like particle made by the herein described inventive method. A virus-like particle containing a fragment of the VP proteins described herein can be formed by any of the above described methods for making a human group C rotavirus-like particle, and also includes: constructing a third baculovirus vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule comprising a sequence encoding a core protein operably linked to a baculovirus promoter that drives expression of said protein in an insect cell; infecting an insect cell culture with said first, second, and third baculovirus vector under conditions that promote expression of the VP6- and VP7 capsid proteins, and the VP2 core protein. In one embodiment of the present invention, the core protein is a group C VP2 protein of ASP 88 strain. Rotavirus particles are harvested, typically from cell culture supernatant for inclusion in an immunogenic composition including a vaccine composition. The rotavirus particles may be isolated from the cell culture supernatant, for example by filtration and/or centrifugation. The isolated rotavirus particles are optionally lyophilized, such as for later resuspension in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Processes Pharmaceutical Compositions and Processes Vaccines and methods for their use to induce active immunity and protection against human rotavirus C-induced illness in a subject are provided according to the present invention. In particular embodiments, human rotavirus C VLPs are administered as antigens for prevention or treatment of human rotavirus C infection such as by serving as an active vaccine component, or by eliciting an immune response in a host organism. Vaccine delivery may occur prior to or following human rotavirus C infection of a host organism or patient. A vaccine optionally contains one or more adjuvants and preservatives or other pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In particular embodiments, vaccine compositions include one or more types of human rotavirus C VLP admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier which is substantially non-toxic to a subject and substantially inert to the human rotavirus C VLPs included in a vaccine composition. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a solid, liquid or gel in form and is typically sterile and pyrogen free. An immunogenic composition of the present invention may be in any form suitable for administration to a subject. An immunogenic composition is administered by any suitable route of administration including oral and parenteral such as intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, mucosal, nasal, or subcutaneous routes of administration. For example, an immunogenic composition for parenteral administration may be formulated as an injectable liquid including a rotavirus and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers include water, ethanol, polyols such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and the like, suitable mixtures thereof; vegetable oils such as olive oil; and injectable organic esters such as ethyloleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of a desirable particle size in the case of dispersions, and/or by the use of a surfactant, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. A stabilizer is optionally included such as, for example, EDTA, EGTA, and an antioxidant. A solid dosage form for administration or for suspension in a liquid prior to administration illustratively includes capsules, tablets, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, rotavirus particles are admixed with at least one carrier illustratively including a buffer such as, for example, sodium citrate or an alkali metal phosphate illustratively including sodium phosphates, potassium phosphates and calcium phosphates; a filler such as, for example, starch, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid; a binder such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alignates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia; a humectant such as, for example, glycerol; a disintegrating agent such as, for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, plant starches such as potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain complex silicates, and sodium carbonate; a solution retarder such as, for example, paraffin; an absorption accelerator such as, for example, a quaternary ammonium compound; a wetting agent such as, for example, cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate, and a glycol; an adsorbent such as, for example, kaolin and bentonite; a lubricant such as, for example, talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, a solid polyethylene glycol or sodium lauryl sulfate; a preservative such as an antibacterial agent and an antifungal agent, including for example, thimerosal, sorbic acid, gentamycin and phenol; and a stabilizer such as, for example, EDTA, EGTA, and an antioxidant. Solid dosage forms optionally include a coating such as an enteric coating. The enteric coating is typically a polymeric material. Preferred enteric coating materials have the characteristics of being bioerodible, gradually hydrolyzable and/or gradually water-soluble polymers. The amount of coating material applied to a solid dosage generally dictates the time interval between ingestion and drug release. A coating is applied having a thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below 3 associated with stomach acids, yet dissolves above pH 3 in the small intestine environment. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH-dependent solubility profile is readily used as an enteric coating in the practice of the present invention to achieve delivery of the active agent to the lower gastrointestinal tract. The selection of the specific enteric coating material depends on properties such as resistance to disintegration in the stomach; impermeability to gastric fluids and active agent diffusion while in the stomach; ability to dissipate at the target intestine site; physical and chemical stability during storage; non-toxicity; and ease of application. Suitable enteric coating materials illustratively include cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose succinate and carboxymethylcellulose sodium; acrylic acid polymers and copolymers, preferably formed from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ammonium methylacrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and/or ethyl; vinyl polymers and copolymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, vinylacetate crotonic acid copolymer, and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers; shellac; and combinations thereof. A particular enteric coating material includes acrylic acid polymers and copolymers described for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,136,345. The enteric coating optionally contains a plasticizer to prevent the formation of pores and cracks that allow the penetration of the gastric fluids into the solid dosage form. Suitable plasticizers illustratively include triethyl citrate (Citroflex 2), triacetin (glyceryl triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec A2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid esters, propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, a coating composed of an anionic carboxylic acrylic polymer typically contains approximately 10% to 25% by weight of a plasticizer, particularly dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. The coating can also contain other coating excipients such as detackifiers, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate), and stabilizers (e.g. hydroxypropylcellulose, acids or bases) to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include rotavirus and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier formulated as an emulsion, solution, suspension, syrup, or elixir. A liquid dosage form of a vaccine composition of the present invention may include a wetting agent, an emulsifying agent, a suspending agent, a sweetener, a flavoring, or a perfuming agent. Detailed information concerning customary ingredients, equipment and processes for preparing dosage forms is found in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, eds. H. A. Lieberman et al., New York: Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1989; and in L. V. Allen, Jr. et al., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 8th Ed., Philadelphia, Pa.: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2004; A. R. Gennaro, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 20th ed., 2003; and J. G. Hardman et al., Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, McGraw-Hill Professional, 10th ed., 2001. An adjuvant is optionally included in a virus composition according to embodiments of the present invention. Adjuvants are known in the art and illustratively include Freund's adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, aluminum oxide, saponin, dextrans such as DEAE-dextran, vegetable oils such as peanut oil, olive oil, and/or vitamin E acetate, mineral oil, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, and proteoglycans. The term “subject” is used herein to refer to a human. Non-human animals, illustratively including cows, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, cats, birds, poultry, and rodents, are also referred to by the term subject in particular embodiments of the present invention. A vaccine composition of the present invention may be in any form suitable for administration to a subject. A vaccine composition is administered by any suitable route of administration including oral and parenteral such as intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, mucosal, nasal, or subcutaneous routes of administration. The phrase “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount effective to induce an immunological response and prevent or ameliorate signs or symptoms of human rotavirus C-mediated disease. Induction of an immunological response in a subject can be determined by any of various techniques known in the art, illustratively including detection of anti-human rotavirus C antibodies, measurement of anti-human rotavirus C antibody titer and/or lymphocyte proliferation assay. Signs and symptoms of human rotavirus C-mediated disease may be monitored to detect induction of an immunological response to administration of a vaccine composition of the present invention in a subject. Administration of a vaccine composition according to a method of the present invention includes administration of one or more doses of a vaccine composition to a subject at one time in particular embodiments. Alternatively, two or more doses of a vaccine composition are administered at time intervals of weeks—years. A suitable schedule for administration of vaccine composition doses depends on several factors including age and health status of the subject, type of vaccine composition used and route of administration, for example. One of skill in the art is able to readily determine a dose and schedule of administration to be administered to a particular subject. Immunogenicity of human rotavirus C VLPs is tested by any of various assays known in the art. In a particular example, purified human rotavirus C VLPs are administered intramuscularly to mice with or without an adjuvant. Immunogenicity is assayed by measuring immunoglobulin titers including IgM, IgA and/or IgG in blood samples obtained at various times after administration. Neutralizing antibody titers are measured by neutralization assays known in the art, such as those generally described in Kuby, J., Immunology, 3rd ed. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York, N.Y., 1997. Since human rotavirus C does not grow in culture, sera from mice injected with human rotavirus C VLPs are serially diluted two-fold in duplicate wells and incubated with trypsin-activated porcine rotavirus C. Activated porcine rotavirus C or serum-free MEM medium is incubated in the absence of mouse serum and serve as positive and negative controls, respectively. MA104 cells in MEM medium supplemented with trypsin are added to each well. After incubation at 37° C. for 18 hours, cells are fixed with formalin. Porcine rotavirus C antigens in the fixed MA104 cells are detected by incubating cells with HRP-labeled rabbit IgG against human rotavirus VLPs, and then tetramethyl benzidine. Neutralizing antibody titer in a serum is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution giving a 70% reduction in absorbance value compared to that in the virus control. Optionally, antibodies raised to immunogenic human rotavirus C VLPs are administered to a subject for prevention or therapeutic treatment relating to human rotavirus C-mediated disease. Additional therapeutics that are optionally administered with the vaccine composition or antibodies raised to human rotavirus C VLPs include antivirals such as amantadine, rimantadine, gancyclovir, acyclovir, ribavirin, penciclovir, oseltamivir, foscarnet zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), lamivudine (3TC), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), nevirapine, delavirdine, indinavir, ritonavir, vidarabine, nelfinavir, saquinavir, relenza, tamiflu, pleconaril, interferons; steroids and corticosteroids such as prednisone, cortisone, fluticasone and glucocorticoid; antibiotics; analgesics; antidiarrheals, fluid replacement; or other treatments for rotavirus infection. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical kit that includes one or more receptacles containing one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. In a preferred embodiment, the kit contains an antibody specific for human rotavirus C VP2, human rotavirus C VP6, human rotavirus C VP7, the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 1, an epitope or a variant thereof, the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 32, an epitope or a variant thereof, the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 34, an epitope or a variant thereof, or any human rotavirus C epitope, a polypeptide or protein of the present invention, or a nucleic acid molecule of the invention, alone or in combination with adjuvants, antivirals, antibiotics, analgesic, bronchodilators, or other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The present invention further encompasses kits comprising a container containing a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and instructions for use. Also provided is a diagnostic kit for detecting human rotavirus C infection that contains human rotavirus C VLPs as reagents for the detection of human rotavirus C antibodies. It is further appreciated that a diagnostic kit optionally includes ancillary reagents such as buffers, solvents, a detectable label and other reagents necessary and recognized in the art for detection of an antibody in a biological sample. Detection of Anti-Human Rotavirus C Antibodies Human rotavirus C VLPs are used to detect anti-human rotavirus C antibodies in a biological sample according to embodiments of a process of the present invention. The term “biological sample” refers to a sample obtained from a biological organism, a tissue, cell, cell culture medium, or any medium suitable for mimicking biological conditions, or from the environment. Non-limiting examples include, saliva, gingival secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, gastrointestinal fluid, mucous, urogenital secretions, synovial fluid, blood, serum, plasma, urine, cystic fluid, lymph fluid, ascites, pleural effusion, interstitial fluid, intracellular fluid, ocular fluids, seminal fluid, mammary secretions, and vitreal fluid, feces, and nasal secretions. Environmental samples such as sewage or water samples can be used. In a preferred embodiment, the sample is serum, plasma or whole blood. A process of detecting anti-human rotavirus C antibodies in a biological sample according to the present invention includes contacting a biological sample with recombinant human rotavirus C VLPs and detecting formation of a complex between anti-human rotavirus C antibodies present in the biological sample and the human rotavirus C VLPs. Formation of the complex between anti-human rotavirus C antibodies present in the biological sample and the human rotavirus C VLPs is indicative of exposure of the subject to human rotavirus C sufficient to activate the immune system of the subject to produce anti-human rotavirus C antibodies. Formation of the complex specifically indicates presence of anti-human rotavirus C antibodies since other enteric virus antibodies, particularly anti-human rotavirus A antibodies, do not form a complex with the human rotavirus C VLPs. In a preferred embodiment, human rotavirus C VLPs are used to detect anti-human rotavirus C antibodies in a biological sample to diagnose current and recent human rotavirus C infection in a subject. In a further preferred embodiment human rotavirus C VLPs are used in a process of assessing the immune status of an individual with respect to past or present exposure to a human rotavirus C antigen in human rotavirus C infection susceptible organisms, particularly in a human subject. Detecting formation of a complex between anti-human rotavirus C antibodies present in a biological sample and human rotavirus C VLPs is achieved by any of various methods known in the art, illustratively including detection of a label attached to human rotavirus C VLPs or attached to the anti-human rotavirus C antibodies. The term “label” or “labeled” refers to any composition which can be used to detect, qualitatively or quantitatively, a substance attached to the label. Suitable labels include a fluorescent moiety, a radioisotope, a chromophore, a bioluminescent moiety, an enzyme, a magnetic particle, an electron dense particle, and the like. The term “label” or “labeled” is intended to encompass direct labeling of human rotavirus C VLPs or an antibody by coupling (i.e., physically linking) a detectable substance to the human rotavirus C VLPs or antibody, as well as indirect labeling of the human rotavirus C VLPs or antibody by interaction with another reagent that is directly labeled. An example of indirect labeling of a primary antibody includes detection of a primary antibody using a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Labels used in detection of complex formation depend on the detection process used. Such detection processes are incorporated in particular assay formats illustratively including ELISA, western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry, immuno-fluorescence assay, liquid chromatography, flow cytometry, other detection processes known in the art, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, an ELISA is used to detect the presence of human rotavirus C antibodies in a biological sample. In one configuration of an ELISA for human rotavirus C antibodies, human rotavirus C VLPs are coated on a support such as a microtiter plate, beads, slide, silicon chip or other solid support such as a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane. A biological sample is incubated with the human rotavirus C VLPs on the support and the presence of complex between antibodies to human rotavirus C and human rotavirus C VLPs is detected by standard ELISA protocols. For example, a complex between human rotavirus C VLPs and human rotavirus C antibodies is detected by reaction of a labeled secondary antibody with the anti-human rotavirus C antibodies and detection of the label. Another example of an ELISA for human rotavirus C antibodies is a sandwich ELISA. One embodiment of a sandwich ELISA includes depositing a binding antibody onto a solid support. The binding antibody is optionally a non-competing antibody that recognizes human rotavirus C VLPs. The binding antibody is incubated with human rotavirus C VLPs. The complex is washed to remove any unbound material and a detectable label, such as a fluorescently labeled antibody directed to human rotavirus C VLPs, is applied. The detectable label is detected, if present, indicating the presence of anti-human rotavirus C antibody in the biological sample. Further details of ELISA assays in general are found in Crowther, J. R., The ELISA Guidebook (Methods in Molecular Biology), Humana Press, 2000; and Wild, D., The Immunoassay Handbook, 3rd Edition, Elsevier Science, 2005. A human rotavirus C antibody detection kit is provided including one or more types of human rotavirus C VLPs and ancillary reagents for use in detecting anti-human rotavirus C antibodies in a biological sample. Ancillary reagents are any signal producing system materials for detection of a complex between an anti-human rotavirus C antibody and a human rotavirus C VLP in any suitable detection process such as ELISA, western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry, immuno-fluorescence, mass spectrometry, or other assay known in the art. Optionally, an anti-human human rotavirus C antibody assay kit according to embodiments of the present invention includes human rotavirus C VLPs attached to a solid substrate. Suitable solid substrates include, but are not limited to, microtiter plates, chips, tubes, membranes, such as nylon or nitrocellulose membranes, and particles, such as beads. Attachment of protein-containing materials to solid substrates is well-known in the art and includes, but is not limited to, adsorption. In a preferred embodiment, a human rotavirus C antibody detection kit of the present invention illustratively includes one or more types of human rotavirus C VLPs; and one or more ancillary reagents such as a high binding microtiter plate or other support, blocking agent, washing buffer such as phosphate buffered saline, a labeled anti-immunoglobulin antibody, and matching detection agents, swab or other sample collection devices, control reagents such as labeled non-competing or unlabelled reagents, control nucleotide sequence and relevant primers and probes, and other materials and reagents for detection. The kit optionally includes instructions printed or in electronically accessible form and/or customer support contact information. Anti-immunoglobulin antibodies in a signal producing system or otherwise are optionally labeled with a fluorophore, biotin, peroxidase, or other enzymatic or non-enzymatic detection label. It is appreciated that a signal producing system may employ an unlabeled primary antibody and a labeled secondary antibody derived from the same or a different organism. It is further appreciated that non-antibody signal producing systems are similarly operable. It is further appreciated that a kit optionally includes ancillary reagents such as buffers, solvents, a detectable label and other reagents necessary and recognized in the art for detection of an antibody in a biological sample. VLPs Containing a Cargo Optionally, the VLP contains a cargo in the internal space defined by the VLP. In particular embodiments, a cargo moiety is a substance to be delivered to a subject or cell. Exemplary cargo moieties include an antigen, a nucleic acid which is not an intact human rotavirus C genome and a therapeutic agent. Particularly provided is a process of delivery of genetic information whereby genetic material is encapsulated in a human rotavirus C capsid which is then introduced into a host cell. The genetic material is optionally DNA or RNA, or modifications thereof. The genetic information is optionally derived from a human rotavirus C or other viral or nonviral organism, or is synthetic. A cargo is incorporated in the internal space defined by a human rotavirus C VLP by any of various methods including introducing the cargo into a host cell such that human rotavirus C VLPs are produced in the presence of the cargo and thereby include the cargo in the internal space. Alternatively or additionally, a cargo is incorporated in the internal space by incubating produced human rotavirus C VLPs with the cargo such that the cargo enters the internal space, e.g. by diffusion. VLP Antibodies Human rotavirus C VLPs are used as antigens for production of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to human rotavirus C for clinical use such as in therapy, analysis or diagnosis; or laboratory research. In a preferred embodiment, human rotavirus C VLPs are used for eliciting human rotavirus C specific antibody or T cell responses to the VP2, VP6, VP7 or any antigen included in the human rotavirus C VLPs, in vivo (e.g., for protective or therapeutic purposes or for providing diagnostic antibodies) and in vitro (e.g., by phage display technology or another technique useful for generating synthetic antibodies). As used herein, the terms “antibody” and “antibodies” relate to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, multispecific antibodies, human antibodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, camelized antibodies, single domain antibodies, single-chain Fvs (scFv), single chain antibodies, disulfide-linked Fvs (sdFv), and anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (including, e.g., anti-Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above. In particular, antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antigen binding site. Immunoglobulin molecules are of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2), or subclass. As used herein, the term “antibody fragment” defines a fragment of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to a human rotavirus C virus, any epitope of the human rotavirus C virus or human rotavirus C VLP. Antibody fragments may be generated by any technique known to one of skill in the art. For example, Fab and F(ab′)2 fragments may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab′) 2 fragments). F(ab′) 2 fragments contain the complete light chain, and the variable region, the CH 1 region and the hinge region of the heavy chain. Antibody fragments are also produced by recombinant DNA technologies. Antibody fragments may be one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies. Human rotavirus C-specific antibodies are provided according to the present invention which specifically bind to human rotavirus C and do not specifically bind to other rotavirus types such as rotavirus A, B, D, E, F and G. A hybridoma cell line expressing monoclonal antibody raised against human rotavirus C VLPs of the present invention specifically binds to human rotavirus C and does not specifically bind to other rotavirus types such as rotavirus A, B, D, E, F and G. An antibody raised to human rotavirus C VLPs by any of the methods known in the art, is optionally purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by ion exchange chromatography, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigen or size exclusion; centrifugation; differential solubility; or by any other standard techniques for the purification of proteins. It is also appreciated thatan inventive antibody or fragments thereof may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences known in the art to facilitate purification. For some uses, including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays, it may be preferable to use chimeric, humanized, or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species, such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a constant region derived from a human immunoglobulin. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (Morrison, 1985, Science, 229:1202; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,715; 4,816,567; and 4,816,397). Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species that bind the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions are substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, such as by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332:323). Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including, for example, CDR-grafting (PCT publication WO 91/09967; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101 and 5,585,089), veneering or resurfacing (Studnicka et al., 1994, Protein Engineering 7(6):805 814; Roguska et al., 1994, PNAS. 91:969 973), and chain shuffling (U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332). Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111). Human antibodies are readily produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins, but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. An inventive antibody is optionally fused or conjugated to heterologous polypeptides may be used in vitro immunoassays and in purification methods such as affinity chromatography. (PCT publication Number WO 93/21232; U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,981). An inventive antibody is optionally attached to solid supports, which are particularly useful for immunoassays or purification of the polypeptides of the invention or fragments, derivatives, analogs, or variants thereof, or similar molecules having the similar enzymatic activities as the polypeptide of the invention. Such solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass, cellulose, polyacrylamide, nylon, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride or polypropylene. Assays for Human Rotavirus C Anti-human rotavirus C VLP antibodies of the present invention are used to detect human rotavirus C in a biological sample in embodiments of the present invention. An assay for human rotavirus C in a biological sample of the present invention includes contacting a biological sample with an anti-human rotavirus C antibody and detecting formation of a complex between anti-human rotavirus C antibody and the human rotavirus C present in the biological sample. Formation of the complex is indicative of current infection by human rotavirus C in a subject from which a biological sample is obtained. Formation of the complex specifically indicates presence of human rotavirus C since other rotavirus types such as rotavirus A, B, D, E, F and G, do not form a complex with an anti-human rotavirus C antibody of the present invention. In a specific embodiment, the processes further involve obtaining a biological sample from a subject, contacting the sample with a compound or agent capable of detecting the presence of human rotavirus C nucleic acid in the sample in order to confirm presence of human rotavirus C in the sample. In further embodiments, a control sample is assayed for presence of human rotavirus C and/or anti-human rotavirus C antibodies and results are compared with a test sample to ascertain a difference in presence or amount of human rotavirus C or anti-human rotavirus C antibodies. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of determining exposure of a human or animal to a group C rotavirus comprising: contacting a biological sample of said human or animal with the inventive rotavirus-like particle described herein, under conditions which promote binding of antibodies in said biological sample to said rotavirus-like particles; and detecting binding of antibodies within the biological sample with the rotavirus-like particles. For the purposes of determining exposure of a human or animal to a group C rotavirus, biological sample typically is blood and/or feces; however, biological sample also includes a sample from other tissues; e.g. an intestinal biopsy. The invention also encompasses kits for detecting the presence of human rotavirus C in a test sample. The kit, for example, includes an anti-human rotavirus C antibody and optionally includes a reagent such as a labeled secondary antibody or agent capable of detecting an antibody in a complex with a human rotavirus C and, in certain embodiments, for determining the titer in the sample. Embodiments of inventive compositions and methods are illustrated in the following examples. These examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are not considered limitations on the scope of inventive compositions and methods.

Sf9 or High Five (Hi5) insect cells were grown and maintained in EX-CELL 420 or 405 media (Sigma, Lenexa, Kans.) or HyQ SFX-INSECT media in shaker flasks at 27° C. Sf9 and Hi5 cells were subcultured every 3 or 4 days at a concentration of 1×106 cells/ml and 5×105 cells/ml, respectively. Stationary superinfections were performed by seeding Sf9 cells in HyQ or EX-CELL 420 and Hi5 cells in HyQ or EX-CELL 405 into a T150 flask at a concentration of 3×105 cells/ml. Baculovirus constructs (rVP2, rVP6 and rVP7) were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 each. Infections were carried out without proteinase inhibitors and infected cultures were harvested at day 5. Large scale VLP production was performed in suspension culture by seeding Sf9 cells in EX-CELL 420 into fernbach flasks at a concentration of 1×106 cells/ml. Baculovirus recombinants were added one day later at an MOI of 1.4 each and harvested on day 4. EXAMPLE 3 Western blot. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out with 12% separating and 5% stacking gels using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (16). Samples were heated at 97° C. for 5 min with 10% β-mecaptoethanol prior to loading and then electrophoresed. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 10% methanol). After blocking with 10% (for unpurified GpC RV proteins) blotto in PBS-T for 1-2 hrs at room temperature or 15% (for purified GpC RV proteins) blotto in PBS-T overnight at 4° C., membranes were incubated with porcine hyperimmune serum (1:2,000) to Cowden in 5% blotto in PBS-T overnight at 4° C. or rabbit hyperimmune serum (1:20,000) to human GpC VLPs in 10% blotto in PBS-T for 1 h. Membranes were washed in PBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) goat anti-pig (1:142,000) (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.) in 5% blotto or HRP-goat anti rabbit (1:20,000) (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) in 10% blotto. GpC RV proteins were visualized with Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate Kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) by exposing membranes to film and processing with medical film processor SRX-101A (Konica Minolta, Jakarta, Indonesia). EXAMPLE 4 Purification of VLPs. Infected cell cultures were clarified twice at 15,344×g for 30 min at 4° C. with a JA-14 rotor in J2-MC centrifuge. Clarified supernatants were layered over 35% sucrose cushions and centrifuged for two hrs at 107,000×g (4° C.) with the SW32Ti rotor in an Optima L-80 XP Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). Pellets were resuspended in TNC buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 140 mM NaC1, 5 mM CaC12), re-clarified in a microcentrifuge and treated twice sequentially with equal volume Vertrel (Miller-Stephenson, Danbury, Conn.). Samples were centrifuged 10 min at 2,095×g (4° C.) with a SX4750A rotor in the Allegra X-12R tabletop centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, Calif.). The aqueous layer was overlaid on top of a CsCl solution (1.2738 g/ml) and centrifuged 17-18 hrs at 111,000×g (4° C.) with the SW40Ti rotor. Fractions that contained VLPs were collected, diluted in TNC, and pelleted out by centrifugation at 107,000×g (4° C.) for 1 hr in the SW32Ti rotor. Particles were resuspended in Hanks balanced salt solution (Gibco, Grand Island, N.Y.) supplemented with 10% sorbitol. EXAMPLE 5 Electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy. GpC RV VLPs were examined by electron microscopy (EM) and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) as previously described with modifications (19). Briefly, 1% ammonium molybdate-1% trehalose in water (pH 6.95) was used to provide negative contrast on specimens adsorbed to nickel formvar-carbon filmed grids (9). Each grid was pretreated with 1% alcian blue 8GX in water to enhance hydrophilicity and provide cationic charges to the film surface prior to applying specimens. IEM was done by mixing 1 μl of purified GpC RV VLPs or GpA RV RRV with 1 μl of rabbit antibody to GpA or GpC RV diluted 1:500 and applying to nickel formvar-carbon coated grids. After incubation for 0.5-1 hr, the grids were blotted with filter paper, rinsed with 0.1 M Tris buffer supplemented with 0.4% acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Aurion, Hatfield, Pa.), and incubated for 30 min with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 6 nm colloidal gold (1:20). Grids were rinsed twice with Tris buffer without BSA and with deionized water, blotted, stained with ammonium molybdate-trehalose, and viewed within an FEI Technai BioTwin transmission electron microscope at 120 KV accelerating voltage. Images were captured digitally with a 2K×2K AMT digital camera. EXAMPLE 6 Production of antisera to GpC VLPs. Rabbits (Covance, Denver, Pa.) were screened for the presence of GpA and C RV antibodies by antigen capture EIA prior to immunization. Rabbit CD94, which tested negative for GpA and C antigens, was selected for antibody production. CD94 was injected subcutaneously with 50 μg GpC VLPs formulated in Freud's complete adjuvant. Subsequent doses formulated with Freud's incomplete adjuvant were administered three weeks after the previous injection. Five injections in total were administered. The first bleed was 10 days after dose two and all subsequent bleeds were scheduled three weeks after the previous bleed. All bleeds tested positive for GpC RV antibody and were pooled. EXAMPLE 7 Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs). 96-well plates were coated with 100 μl supernatant from GpA RRV infected MA104 cell cultures or GpC VLPs in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells diluted (1:100) in coating buffer and incubated overnight at 37° C. Plates were washed with PBS-T and then blocked with 150 μl 5% blotto for 1 hr at 37° C. Plates were washed and then incubated with 1000 of serially diluted hyperimmune serum from rabbits CD94, CD8, and 8807A in diluent (1% blotto, 0.5% polyoxethylene ether W1 in PBS) for 2 hrs at 37° C. Rabbit CD8 was immunized with GpA RV RRV, whereas rabbit 8807A was naturally infected with GpA RV and also immunized with GpC RV Cowden. Plates were washed and then incubated with HRP goat anti-rabbit IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.) diluted (1:3,000) in diluent for 1 hr at 37° C. Plates were washed 6 times with PBS-T and then reacted with 100 μl of tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) for 10 min. Reactions were stopped with 100 μl 1N HC1 and plates were read at Abs450. Antibody titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum giving a net optical density (OD) value (OD with virus minus OD with blotto) above 0.1. EXAMPLE 8 Kinetics of GpC RV protein synthesis in Sf9 and Hi5 cells. Sf9 and Hi5 cells in EX-CELL or HyQ media were infected with GpC RV VP2, VP6, and VP7 baculovirus recombinants at an MOI of 1 each and infected cultures were harvested on days 3, 4 and 5. Infected cultures were clarified and analyzed by Western blot using Cowden specific porcine hyperimmune serum to determine the expression profiles of proteins secreted into the supernatant. FIGS. 1A and 1B are electrophoretic gels showing the kinetics of GpC RV VP6 and VP7 expression in Sf9, FIG. 1A, or Hi5, FIG. 1B, cells in different media. In both FIGS. 1A and 1B, lane 1, Cowden strain; lanes 2-5, infected cultures in HyQ harvested 0, 3-5 dpi; and lanes 6-9, infected cultures in EX-CELL harvested at 0, 3-5 dpi. GpC RV VP6 and VP7 are indicated on the right. Molecular markers 54 kDa and 37.5 kDa are indicated by arrows on the left. Expression of GpC RV VP6 and VP7 increased with time, with the highest levels seen at 4 or 5 days post infection (dpi) in Sf9 and Hi5 cells. Use of EX-CELL media resulted in higher rotavirus protein yields in both cell lines. Higher protein expression was achieved in EX-CELL media than in HyQ medium and similar levels of protein expression were observed in Sf9 and Hi5 cells. The cell line Sf9 and EX-CELL 420 were used in further examples of GpC RV protein production described herein. Human GpC RV VP2 was not detectable with the serum used. EXAMPLE 9 Self-assembly and characterization of GpC RV VLPs. Superinfections of Sf9 cells with rVP2, rVP6 and rVP7 at an MOI of 1 each resulted in the formation of intact GpC RV VLPs that have the structural order of typical rotavirus. FIG. 2A is an image of an electron micrograph showing VLPs purified from cultures of Sf9 cells in EX-CELL 420 medium that were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding human rotavirus C VP2, VP6, and VP7 at an MOI of 1 each. FIG. 2B is an image of an electron micrograph showing VLPs purified from cultures of Sf9 cells in EX-CELL 420 medium that were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding human rotavirus C VP6 and VP7 at an MOI of 1.4 each. VLPs shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B were stained with 5% ammonium molybdate-1% trehalose. The bar in FIGS. 2A and 2B represents 100 nm. Sf9 cells were also superinfected with all three recombinant viruses at various MOIs (0.1, 0.2, 1 and 2 each) in order to optimize conditions for VLP production. EM analysis of supernatants demonstrated better VLP formation in superinfections performed at the higher MOIs of 1 and 2. To determine if VP2 is essential for VLP formation, superinfections were performed with and without rVP2 and analysis was performed by EM. Because robust VLP formation was demonstrated without rVP2, all subsequent experiments were performed excluding this recombinant. Biochemical composition and antigenicity of purified VP6/7 VLPs were compared with a GpA RV strain, YK-1, by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Images comparing major structural viral proteins from GpA RV YK-1 and GpC VLPs by SDS-PAGE and Western blot are shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, respectively. Proteins from purified YK-1 (lane 1) and VLPs (lane 2) were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and stained by coomassie blue, FIG. 3A, or analyzed by Western blot, FIG. 3B. For western blot, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and incubated with rabbit hyperimmune serum to GpC VLPs. GpC RV VP6 and VP7 are indicated on the right. Arrows indicate molecular weight markers 54 kDa and 37.5 kDa. Human GpC recombinant proteins VP6 and VP7 migrate at similar molecular weights and are present at similar ratios as seen in GpA YK-1, indicating a proper molar ratio in assembled VLPs, illustrate in FIG. 3A. Western blot performed with human GpC VLP specific antibody demonstrated that these human rotavirus C VLPs were antigenic and of good quality, illustrated in FIG. 3B. EXAMPLE 10 Antigenic reactivity of GpC RV antibody. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was produced to purified human rotavirus C VLPs. Prior to immunization, rabbit CD94 had no antibody to GpA or C RV and after inoculations developed a high antibody titer to GpC RV (Table II). In controls, rabbit CD8, immunized with RRV, gave strong positive response to GpA RV, whereas rabbit 8807A, which was naturally infected with GpA RV and immunized with GpC RV Cowden strain, had similar antibody titers to GpA and GpC RV antigens. Hyperimmune serum from rabbit CD94 was utilized to enhance EIA that employs only porcine hyperimmune sera (8). This assay proved to specifically detect GpC RV antigens (VLPs and Cowden) but did not react with other control samples, such as MA104, Sf9 cells, and GpA RV RRV. TABLE II Antibody Titers in Hyperimmune Sera to GpA and C Rotaviruses Reciprocal of IgG Titer Rotavirus Group A (RRV) Group C (VLPs) Rabbit Antigen Pre Post Pre Post CD94 GpC VLPs <100 <100 <100 51,200 CD8 GpA RRV ND 25,600 ND <100 8807A GpC Cowden ND 1,600 ND 3,200 & GpA Hyperimmune sera were tested and antibody titers were determined as described in the text. Pre = pre-immunization serum. Post = post-immunization serum. ND = not determined. Human GpC RV VLPs were further characterized by examining their antigenic properties with immunoelectron microscopy using rabbit hyperimmune sera to GpA and C RV FIG. 4A shows GpC RV VLPs immunostained with GpC-specific rabbit hyperimmune serum. FIG. 4B shows GpC RV VLPs immunostained with GpA-specific rabbit hyperimmune serum. FIG. 4C shows GpA RV immunostained with GpC-specific rabbit hyperimmune serum. FIG. 4D shows GpA RV immunostained with GpA-specific rabbit hyperimmune serum. GpC RV VLPs were specifically labeled with GpC-specific hyperimmune serum and GpA RVs were heavily coated with GpA-specific hyperimmune serum. The bar in FIGS. 4A, 4B, 4C and 4D represents 100 nm. GpC RV antibody specifically reacted with human GpC VLPs but not with GpA RV, RRV. Correspondingly, GpA antibody exhibited specific reactivity with RRV and not with GpC VLPs. These results indicate the occurrence of group-specific interactions between RV antigen and antibody and confirm the absence of cross-reactivities between GpA and GpC RV reagents.
