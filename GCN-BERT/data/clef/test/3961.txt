The embodiments of the present invention may be oriented in various ways. For example, the diagrams, apparatuses, etc. shown in the drawing figures may be flipped over, rotated by 90° in any direction, reversed, etc. For purposes of the present invention, a value or property is “based” on a particular value, property, the satisfaction of a condition or other factor, if that value is derived by performing a mathematical calculation or logical decision using that value, property, the satisfaction of a condition or other factor. For purposes of the present invention, the term “antimicrobial” refers to a material that kills or inhibits the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, molds or protozoans. For purposes of the present invention, the term “antimicrobial organometallic additive” refers to an organometallic additive that imparts antimicrobial properties to a product of which the antimicrobial organometallic additive is a part or increases the antimicrobial properties of a product of which the antimicrobial organometallic additive is a part. For purposes of the present invention, the term “degree of antimicrobial activity” refers to the percentage reduction in Colony Forming Units (CFU) observed when a polymer product is subjected to JIS Z 2801 test protocol described below in the Examples section. For example, if a 99.99831% reduction in Colony Forming Units (CFU) is observed for a polymer product, the product has a 99.99831% degree of antimicrobial activity. For purposes of the present invention, the term “dispersed throughout” refers to one or more antimicrobial organometallic additives being distributed relatively evenly throughout a polymer host matrix. For purposes of the present invention, the term “long-chain fatty acid” refers to a fatty acid having an aliphatic tail of 13 or more carbon atoms. For purposes of the present invention, the term “long-chain fatty acid group” refers to the ester group derived from a long-chain fatty acid. An example of a long-chain fatty acid group is a stearate group. For purposes of the present invention, the term “majority” refers to a majority by molar amount. For example, if there were a mixture of antimicrobial organometallic additives comprising 1.0 mole of cupric stearate and 1.0 mole of silver stearate present in a polymer product, 0.1 total moles of metals in a UV absorber dispersed throughout the polymer product and 0.2 moles of metal ions in a color in the polymer product, the antimicrobial organometallic additives would constitute a majority of the metallic species in the polymer product: 2.0 total moles of antimicrobial organometallic additives to 0.3 total moles of metallic species from other sources dispersed throughout the polymer. For purposes of the present invention, the term “metallic species” refers to the metals, metal ions and metal-containing compounds present in a polymer product, depending on the polymer product. In addition to the metals in the antimicrobial organometallic additive of the present invention, polymer products of the present invention may also include metallic species that are metals, metal ions and metal-containing compounds such as metal salts, metal oxides, organometallic oxides, etc. For purposes of the present invention, the term “organometallic additive” refers to a compound including a metal bound to an organic radical, where the metal species has a valence state of +1, +2, +3, etc. For purposes of the present invention, the term “polymer host matrix” refers to a polymer or mixtures of polymers in which one or more antimicrobial organometallic additives are dispersed. A polymer may be a copolymer. A polymer host matrix includes components in addition to the polymer that do not react with the organometallic additives dispersed in the polymer host matrix. For example, the polymer host matrix may be fiberglass which comprises a polymer having dispersed therein glass fibers. Other fibers, such as carbon or graphene, metals and ceramics may also be used, as well as polymer fibers such as Kevlar® (DuPont's registered trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber). For purposes of the present invention, the term “room temperature” refers to a temperature of from about 20° C. to about 25° C. For purposes of the present invention, the term “a solid solution in a polymer host matrix” refers to an organometallic additive mechanically dispersed throughout and suspended within the polymer host matrix. For purposes of the present invention, the term “sparingly soluble in water” refers to a substance having a solubility of 0.1 g per 100 ml of water to 1 g per 100 ml of water. Unless specified otherwise, the term “sparingly soluble” and “sparingly soluble in water” are used interchangeably in the description of the invention below to refer to substances that are sparingly soluble in water. For purposes of the present invention, the term “thermosetting powder” refers to a powder that when applied and subjected to heat will melt, flow and chemically crosslink to form a film coating on a substrate. Thermosetting powders are primarily composed of relatively high molecular weight solid resins and a crosslinker. The primary resins used in the formulation of a thermosetting powder are: epoxy, polyester and acrylic. These primary resins may be used with different crosslinkers to produce a variety of powder coatings. For purposes of the present invention, the term “thermoset powder coating” refers to a film coating formed by melting, flowing and chemically crosslinking a thermosetting powder. Chemical reactions during the curing cycle of a thermoset powder coating create a polymer network which may provide resistance to coating breakdown. Once cured and crosslinked, this polymer network will not melt and flow again if heat is applied. For purposes of the present invention, the term “water insoluble” refers to a substance that has a solubility of less than 0.1 g per 100 ml of water. DESCRIPTION Because material surfaces may become contaminated with disease-causing agents, there is a need for materials with anti-bacterial, anti-virus, anti-fungal, anti-mold, etc. functionality; these are generally referred to as antimicrobials. Polymeric materials made from organic materials, inorganic materials or organic-inorganic material blends are ubiquitous in the environment, and if made to reduce antimicrobial disease-causing agents would play a valuable role in producing a healthier environment. Three general classes of art for producing antimicrobial bulk polymers and polymer surfaces using additive systems currently exist: (1) nanoscale metal particles, (2) metal aluminosilicates, and (3) organic compounds. Although this art has demonstrated some utility it suffers from several limitations of which the following are the most often cited: (1) wears out due to repeated handling, washing or scrubbing of surface applied materials,(2) renders the bulk material not recyclable,(3) does not confer significant antimicrobial resistance,(4) narrow range of effectiveness against antimicrobial agents,(5) is toxic to viruses and molds with potential toxicity to humans at the levels employed,(6) modification required of existing plastic product manufacturing, equipment or processes,(7) post-production steps required for surface coating,(8) incomplete coverage/coating due to “hidden” surfaces,(9) is incompatible with critical geometries, such as products having micro-scale tolerances or dimensions. In addition to the above-mentioned limitations of the existing art, the current products employing metal and aluminosilicate antimicrobial additives: (a) are costly, (b) have final product process-related issues such as reduced time-to-fabrication tooling wear out, therefore requiring more frequent tool replacement, and (c) require novel chemical moieties as surface ligands to help disperse and keep the particles from settling or agglomerating. Furthermore, current products employ organic antimicrobial additives that cannot be readily incorporated with many organic materials since these antimicrobial additives are: (a) chemically aggressive and inhibit the reaction processes of many thermosets and (b) degrade the mechanical, thermal and optical properties of many thermoplastics and thermosets. An example of existing art appears in United States Patent Application No. 2011/0002872 to Ohashi et al., but this patent application does not describe the final form of the product that integrates the antimicrobial invention, but instead describes a conversion process (e.g., thermal decomposition) of a fatty acid metal salt for forming ultrafine metal particles that can be dispersed in a resin for further processing. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a polymer product comprising a polymer host matrix having dispersed therein at least one antimicrobial organometallic additive or a blend of antimicrobial organometallic additives that impart antimicrobial properties to the bulk and surface of the polymer host matrix. In one embodiment, the present invention provides uniformly dispersed antimicrobial functionality in a variety of host matrix polymer materials and a broad range of form factors. For example, the dispersed antimicrobial organometallic additives may be used to impart antimicrobial properties to the bulk and surface of a polymer host matrix in the form of bulk polymer products, film polymer products, sheet polymer products, polymer coating products, coated polymer products, composite polymer products, fibrous polymer products, a rod polymer products, core-containing polymer products and other types of polymer products.

In one embodiment, the film material is less than 0.1 mm thick. FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate in schematic form polymer products that each may be a bulk polymer product, a film polymer product or a sheet polymer product, depending on factors such as the dimensions of the polymer product, the polymer host matrix used, the physical properties of the polymer product, etc. FIG. 1 depicts a polymer product 102 having dispersed therein an antimicrobial organometallic additive 112 distributed uniformly throughout a polymer host matrix 118.

The metal part of each of the antimicrobial organometallic additives may be the same or different and/or the organic part of each of the antimicrobial organometallic additives may be the same or different. The polymer product of FIG. 1 and/or FIG. 2 may have virtually any size or shape.

Polymer coating 312 is chemically and/or mechanically bonded to the substrate 314 at interface 340. Although three antimicrobial organometallic additives are shown in the polymer coating of FIG. 3, there may be one, two, three, four or more antimicrobial organometallic additives in a polymer coating of the present invention. The antimicrobial organometallic additives may be of the same chemistry or they may be of different chemistries.

The antimicrobial organometallic additive may be the same chemistry or different chemistry. A core-containing polymer product of the present invention may have various shapes such as spherical (as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12), rectangular box-shaped (as shown in FIGS. 13 and 14), cube-shaped, ellipsoid-shaped, cone-shaped, pyramidal, rod-shaped, ring-shaped, disks, rectangular plate-shaped, irregularly shaped, multi-polygonal, multi-dimensional, etc. A spherical or nearly spherical core-containing polymer product may be used in balls for purifying liquids such as but not limited to water, water-based liquids, water-based fruit juices, milk, etc. Pelletized polymer products used as the feedstock in the manufacture of final polymer products, for example, thermal injection molding, extrusion, etc., can also have spherical or near spherical form.

The antimicrobial organometallic additive in any of the polymer products and/or any portion and/or layer of a polymer product of the present invention may be at various ratios with respect to each other. For example, when a blend of three antimicrobial organometallic additives are dispersed in a polymer host matrix of the present invention, the ratio of the antimicrobial organometallic additives may be 1:1:1, 1:2:1, 2:3:4, or any other suitable ratio. In one embodiment, the antimicrobial organometallic additives are a majority of the metallic species present in a polymer host matrix of a polymer product of the present invention. In some embodiments of the present invention there may be low levels of metals or metal ions present from other additives dispersed throughout the polymer host matrix (e.g., UV protectors, colorants, etc.). In some embodiments of the present invention, the antimicrobial organometallic additives may be the only metallic species present in a polymer host matrix of a polymer product of the present invention. In one embodiment, the antimicrobial polymer products of the present invention include antimicrobial organometallic additives that are water insoluble or sparingly soluble in water. A single water insoluble or sparingly insoluble antimicrobial organometallic additive may be employed or mixtures of water insoluble and/or sparingly soluble antimicrobial organometallic additives may be employed. In one embodiment of the present invention, the water insoluble antimicrobial organometallic additives may comprise a long-chain fatty acid group as their organic component. Such compounds include, metal stearates and mixtures thereof. Suitable metal stearates that provide antimicrobial activity to a polymer product include, silver stearate, cupric stearate, zinc stearate, etc., and mixtures thereof. One advantage of using water insoluble antimicrobial organometallic additives having a long-chain fatty acid group as their organic component is that that they should provide long-lasting antimicrobial activity to polymer products, even when the polymer products are exposed to moisture or immersed in water. The water insolubility of such additives and the presence of the long-chain fatty acid group should cause such additives to stay bound and/or complexed in the polymer of the polymer product and not leach into the moisture or water. This is different than that for water soluble antimicrobial organometallic additives, for example, acetate based systems. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a polyurethane product having antimicrobial activity that may be made by mixing one or more antimicrobial organometallic additives of the present invention with a liquid polyurethane at room temperature. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a powder coat product, such as a thermoset powder coating. A thermoset powder coating may be formed by mixing one or more antimicrobial organometallic additives in powder form with a thermosetting powder to form a powder mixture. The powder mixture is then applied to a substrate and heated to melt, flow and chemically crosslink the components of the thermosetting powder in the powder mixture to form a thermoset film coating on the substrate. The thermoset coating has the one or more antimicrobial organometallic additives dispersed therein. The temperature that is used to form the thermoset film coating depends on the particular components of the thermosetting powder. In one embodiment, the temperature used to form the thermoset film coating is from 170° C. to 215° C. In one embodiment of the present invention, the host matrix may be paraffin wax. A paraffin wax product of the present invention may be formed by mixing one or more antimicrobial organometallic additives with liquid paraffin wax at temperature of 37° C. to 100° C. to form a paraffin wax product having the one or more antimicrobial organometallic additives dispersed throughout the host matrix. The present invention will now be described by way of example. EXAMPLES The testing of antimicrobial activity for the polymer samples in Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 below is performed using the Antimicrobial Test Laboratories' JIS Z 2801 Test for Antimicrobial Activity of Plastics. A summary of the JIS Z 2801 Test procedure is provided below: (1) The test microorganism is prepared, usually by growth in a liquid culture medium.(2) The suspension of test microorganism is standardized by dilution in a nutritive broth (this affords microorganisms the potential to grow during the test).(3) Control and test surfaces are inoculated with microorganisms, in triplicate, and then the microbial inoculum is covered with a thin, sterile film. Covering the inoculum spreads it, prevents it from evaporating, and ensures close contact with the antimicrobial surface.(4) Microbial concentrations are determined at “time zero” by elution followed by dilution and plating.(5) A control is run to verify that the neutralization/elution method effectively neutralizes the antimicrobial agent in the antimicrobial surface being tested.(6) Inoculated, covered control and antimicrobial test surfaces are allowed to incubate undisturbed in a humid environment for 24 hours.(7) After incubation, microbial concentrations are determined Reduction of microorganisms relative to initial concentrations and the control surface is calculated.

The silver acetate powder and clear coat powder are then mixed vigorously to disperse the silver acetate powder in the clear coat powder and to form a powder blend. The powder blend is 2.8% silver acetate and 97.2% clear coat powder by volume. An approximately 5 ml sample of this powder blend is placed in an aluminum foil dish. The sample is heated at 380° F. for 10 minutes and then removed from the oven to cool. The sample is tested for antimicrobial activity using the JIS Z 2801 test protocol. A 99.99831% reduction in Colony Forming Units (CFU) is observed for this sample. The silver acetate powder used in this example has a particle size of less than 25 μm. The clear coat powder used in this example has a particle size of less than 25 μm. The thermoset powder coatings of Examples 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, i.e., Compositions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, demonstrate that cupric stearate, silver stearate and mixtures of cupric stearate and silver stearate are compatible with thermoset powder coatings and provide antimicrobial properties to the thermoset powder coating. Example 6 Composition 6. Silver stearate powder and cupric stearate powder were added to commercial polypropylene pellets (supplied by a commercial manufacturer). A 2% by volume powder blend was produced (1% silver stearate and 1% cupric stearate) with about 1 pound of polypropylene pellets. The samples were thermal injection molded into disks by a commercial manufacturer following standard industry processes for polypropylene. The sample is tested for antimicrobial activity using the JIS Z 2801 test protocol and 99.99989% reduction in Colony Forming Units (CFU) is observed for this sample. The silver stearate powder used in this example had a particle size of less than about 25 μm. The cupric stearate powder used in this example had a particle size of less than about 25 μm. The polypropylene pellet size was about 4 mm. Example 7 Composition 7. Silver stearate powder and cupric stearate powder were added to commercial polypropylene pellets (supplied a commercial manufacturer). A 0.2% by volume powder blend was produced (0.1% silver stearate and 0.1% cupric stearate) with about 1 pound of polypropylene pellets. The samples were thermal injection molded into disks by a commercial manufacturer following standard industry processes for polypropylene. The sample is tested for antimicrobial activity using the JIS Z 2801 test protocol and 99.76966% reduction in Colony Forming Units (CFU) is observed for this sample. The silver stearate powder used in this example had a particle size of less than about 25 μm. The cupric stearate powder used in this example had a particle size of less than about 25 μm. The polypropylene pellet size was about 4 mm. This demonstrates that the volume fraction of additive can produce different efficacy levels in the final product. This enables optimization for a variety of product attributes e.g. cost, efficacy, processing, and performance via permutations of the metal and organic components. The injection molded products of Examples 6 and 7, i.e., Compositions 6 and 7, demonstrate that cupric stearate and silver stearate mixtures are compatible with injection molded polymer products and provide antimicrobial properties to the injection molded polymer product. Example 8 Composition 8. Cupric stearate powder and silver stearate powder was added to 2-part commercial polyurethane (Envirotex Lite Pour-on High Gloss Finish Polyurethane, Environmental Technology, Inc, Fields Landing Calif. 95537) at room temperature. A 1.1% by volume powder blend was produced (1% cupric stearate and 0.1% silver stearate) with the liquid polyurethane. The polyurethane was cast over a test coupon per the manufacturer's directions. The sample is tested for antimicrobial activity using the JIS Z 2801 test protocol and 99.99997% reduction in Colony Forming Units (CFU) is observed for this sample. Example 9 Composition 9. Cupric stearate powder and silver stearate powder was added to 1-part commercial water-based polyurethane (Hanson Group, Atlanta Ga.). A 1.1% by volume powder blend was produced (1% cupric stearate and 0.1% silver stearate) with the liquid water-based polyurethane at room temperature. The polyurethane was spray deposited over a test coupon per the manufacturer's standard operating procedures. The sample is tested for antimicrobial activity using the JIS Z 2801 test protocol and 99.99982% reduction in Colony Forming Units (CFU) is observed for this sample. The polyurethane coatings of Examples 8 and 9, i.e., Compositions 8 and 9, demonstrate that cupric stearate and silver stearate mixtures are compatible with polyurethane and provide antimicrobial properties to a polyurethane coating. Composition 9 also demonstrates that a polyurethane including the antimicrobial organometallic additives cupric stearate and silver stearate may be deposited as a coating on a substrate via spray deposition techniques, the spray deposition techniques used in Example 9 being different that the electrostatic-based powder coat process technique described above in Example 3. This enables optimization of the antimicrobial organometallic additives used for a variety of product attributes e.g. cost, efficacy, processing, and performance via permutations of the metal and organic components. The results for various embodiments of the present invention employing organometallic stearate additives in host polymers are summarized in FIG. 15 which shows various host polymers containing stearate based organometallic additives showing antimicrobial efficacy performance. As seen in FIG. 15, there is a “plateau region” where efficacy is not strongly affected by changes in the volume fraction of organometallic stearate additive(s) added to the host polymer. In addition to concentration measured by volume fraction, concentration can also be measured by atom fraction or molecular fraction. At lower volume fraction concentrations, the efficacy increases smoothly with the concentration. This curve, and resulting curve fit parameters, enable optimization in the amount of organometallic stearate additive used in compositions of the present invention. Note in FIG. 15 that the Compositions 1 and 2 overlap each other. FIG. 16 shows the data depicted in FIG. 15 that has been fit with a curve defined by Equation 1 below: [in-line-formulae]Y=b+(a−b))/(1+10(X−c)) (Equation 1)[/in-line-formulae] where Y is the Log Reduction result derived from the JIS Z 2081 test protocol, X is the concentration of the antimicrobial organometallic additive and parameters a=−2.306×106, b=6.769 and c=−5.530. Equation 1 is a type of dose reduction model, and the fitted data has a chi-square value of 1.163 and an R-square value of 0.975, indicating a reasonable fit to the data. Other equations or systems of equations can also be used, for example the sum of a linear function to approximate the slowly varying concentration “plateau region” plus a polynomial function to approximate the smoothly increasing section of the data set prior to the “plateau region.” FIG. 16 shows the efficacy performance data grouped by various host polymers, i.e., powder coat material, polypropylene, and polyurethane, with one or more antimicrobial organometallic stearate additives. There is a plateau where efficacy is not affected by changes in the volume fraction of antimicrobial organometallic additive(s) added to the host polymer. At lower volume fraction concentrations, the efficacy varies smoothly with the concentration. This curve, and resulting curve fit parameters, enables optimization of cost and efficacy, via permutations in the concentrations of the antimicrobial organometallic additives. FIG. 17 is a graph of the stearate chemistry data set of FIG. 16 with the inclusion of data where the antimicrobial organometallic additive is an acetate (Compositions 4 and 5). Similar to FIG. 16, FIG. 17 has a “plateau region” where efficacy is not strongly affected by changes in the volume fraction of antimicrobial organometallic additive(s) added to the host polymer. At lower volume fraction concentrations, the efficacy increases smoothly with the concentration. This curve, and resulting curve fit parameters, enables optimization of cost and efficacy, via permutations in the concentrations of the antimicrobial organometallic additive(s). The data in FIG. 17 has been fit with the curve defined by Equation 1 above, where Y is the Log Reduction result derived from the JIS Z 2081 test protocol, X is the concentration of the antimicrobial organometallic additive(s) and parameters a=−5.759E6, b=6.433 and c=−5.957. In this case, the fitted data has a CHI-Square value of 3.614 and an R-square value of 0.922, indicating a still reasonable fit to the data. Other equations or systems of equations can also be used, for example the sum of a linear function to approximate the slowly varying concentration “plateau region” plus a polynomial function to approximate the smoothly increasing section of the data set prior to the “plateau region”. Example 10 Composition 10. Cupric stearate powder and silver stearate powder was added to commercial food grade paraffin wax (Gulf Wax Household Paraffin Wax, distributed by Royal Oak Enterprises, LLC, Roswell, Ga. 30076). A 1.1% by volume powder blend was produced (1% cupric stearate and 0.1% silver stearate) by adding the powders to molten wax at a temperature of about 90° C. The molten wax mixture was deposited over a paper substrate (butcher paper). The sample coated the substrate in a uniform manner. Immersion in water for 48 hours did not cause the paper substrate of wax-coated paper to wet. It is expected that this sample will have antimicrobial activity similar to the antimicrobial activity of the samples described above in Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Example 11 Cupric stearate powder and silver stearate powder were added to Gulf Wax Household Paraffin Wax, (which conforms to FDA regulations), supplied by Royal Oak Enterprises, LLC, Roswell, Ga. The cupric stearate powder and silver stearate powder were mixed vigorously to form a powder blend. The powder blend was about 1.0% cupric stearate and about 0.1% silver stearate powder by volume. About 1.2 ml of the powder blend was added to about 120 ml of melted paraffin wax and mixed gently to produce about a 1% loaded by volume solution. The cupric stearate powder used in this example had a particle size of less than 25 μm. The silver stearate powder used in this example had a particle size of less than 25 μm. Paraffin wax with cupric stearate and silver stearate powder was applied to paper towel material (about 8 inch×8 inch) which had a print on the surface by dipping the paper towel material into the molten wax and removing it. The paraffin wax saturated the paper throughout the paper structure. After about 15 seconds, the paraffin wax had cooled and was dry to the touch. The print on the surface was visible through the paraffin wax. The dried samples were placed in water, which did not wet the paper. This demonstrates that the paraffin wax with cupric stearate and silver stearate powder can impart antimicrobial and water protection to paper materials. Papers used included paper towels, kraft paper, butcher paper, and ink jet printer paper. Furthermore, the papers can have a logo printed on it. In a second embodiment, the paper was cut into a strip about 10.5 inch×3.5 inch. Molten paraffin wax with cupric stearate and silver stearate powder was applied as a square about 3.5 inch×3.5 inch on each end, leaving the center 3.5 inch×3.5 inch section uncoated. A structure formed by a three-way fold with the paraffin wax coated ends surrounding the uncoated center was produced. This structure provides a liquid absorbing center bracketed by water porous antimicrobial end plates. The end plates were water porous since the paper may contain holes in the surface to let water flow through it when covered with solidified paraffin wax. This structure can be used as a tray or package liner for storing meat products. Furthermore, the paper can have a logo printed on it.
