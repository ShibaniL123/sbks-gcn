Step 1. 4-Bromo-3-fluoro-5-methylaniline
N-Bromosuccinimide (15.8 g, 89 mmol) was added to a solution of 3-fluoro-5-methylaniline (Combi-Blocks, 11 g, 88 mmol) in DMF (80 mL) cooled to 0° C. in an ice bath. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes. After warming to room temperature, the reaction was stirred for an additional 1 hour. Water and EtOAc were then added, and the separated organic phase was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine. The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (17.2 g, 96%).
