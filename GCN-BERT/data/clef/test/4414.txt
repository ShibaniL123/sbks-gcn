This application is the national phase entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2010/052079, filed Feb. 18, 2010, which claims priority to European Patent Application Nos. 09153855.3, filed Feb. 27, 2009 and 09166131.4, filed Jul. 22, 2009, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. The present invention relates to new drug combinations which contain, in addition to one or more PDE4-inhibitors, at least one NSAID (=non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) (2), processes for preparing them and their use for treating in particular respiratory complaints such as for example COPD, chronic sinusitis and asthma. The invention relates particularly to those drug combinations which comprise, in addition to one or more, preferably one PDE4 inhibitor of general formula 1 wherein X is SO or SO2, but preferably SO, and wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the meanings given in claim 1, at least one NSAID (2), the preparation thereof and use for the treatment of respiratory complaints. PRIOR ART EP 07118901.3 discloses substituted piperidino-dihydrothienopyrimidines of formula 1 as PDE4-inhibitors, the preparation thereof and the use thereof for the treatment of respiratory complaints. It is also known that many “1st generation” PDE4-inhibitors such as rolipram, for example, lead to undesirable side effects. Consequently, it was an object of the present invention to provide a drug or drug combination containing a PDE4 inhibitor which has a low side-effect profile. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly it has now been found that drug combinations that also contain—in addition to a PDE4 inhibitor and in particular in addition to the piperidino-dihydrothienopyrimidinesulphoxides of formula 1 known as PDE4-inhibitors wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the meanings given in claim 1 (1)—at least one NSAID (2), have a significantly lower PDE4-mediated side effect profile compared with a drug that contains the corresponding PDE4 inhibitor or the corresponding piperidino-dihydrothienopyrimidinesulphoxide of formula 1 on its own. Consequently, the dosage of the corresponding dihydrothienopyrimidinesulphoxide of formula 1 (as PDE4 inhibitor) may turn out to be significantly higher, thus increasing its effectiveness in the treatment of for example respiratory complaints such as particularly COPD, chronic sinusitis and asthma while simultaneously retaining a low side effect profile. This therefore gives a larger therapeutic window for the PDE4 inhibitor used. The present invention therefore relates to a novel drug combination which contains, in addition to one or more PDE4-inhibitors, at least one NSAID (=non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) (2). The present invention preferably relates to drug combinations which in addition to one or more, preferably one compound of general formula 1 as PDE4 inhibitor wherein X denotes SO or SO2, R1 denotes

INDICATIONS As has been found, the combinations according to the invention containing a compound of formula 1 and at least one NSAID are characterised by their wide range of applications in the therapeutic field. Particular mention should be made of those applications for which the combinations according to the invention are preferably suited on account of their pharmaceutical efficacy as PDE4 inhibitors. Examples include respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases or complaints, inflammatory diseases of the joints, skin or eyes, cancers, and also diseases of the peripheral or central nervous system. Particular mention should be made of the prevention and treatment of diseases of the airways and of the lung which are accompanied by increased mucus production, inflammations and/or obstructive diseases of the airways. Examples include acute, allergic or chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive bronchitis (COPD), coughing, pulmonary emphysema, allergic or non-allergic rhinitis or sinusitis, chronic rhinitis or sinusitis, asthma, alveolitis, Farmer's disease, hyperreactive airways, infectious bronchitis or pneumonitis, paediatric asthma, bronchiectases, pulmonary fibrosis, ARDS (acute adult respiratory distress syndrome), bronchial oedema, pulmonary oedema, bronchitis, pneumonia or interstitial pneumonia triggered by various causes, such as aspiration, inhalation of toxic gases, or bronchitis, pneumonia or interstitial pneumonia as a result of heart failure, irradiation, chemotherapy, cystic fibrosis or mucoviscidosis, or alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. Also deserving special mention is the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Examples include acute or chronic inflammatory changes in gall bladder inflammation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory pseudopolyps, juvenile polyps, colitis cystica profunda, pneumatosis cystoides intestinales, diseases of the bile duct and gall bladder, e.g. gallstones and conglomerates, for the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the joints such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory diseases of the skin and eyes. Preferential mention should also be made of the treatment of cancers. Examples include all forms of acute and chronic leukaemias such as acute lymphatic and acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic lymphatic and chronic myeloid leukaemia, and bone tumours such as osteosarcoma and all types of glioma such as oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma. Preferential mention should also be made of the prevention and treatment of diseases of the peripheral or central nervous system. Examples of these include depression, bipolar or manic depression, acute and chronic anxiety states, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, acute and chronic multiple sclerosis or acute and chronic pain as well as injuries to the brain caused by stroke, hypoxia or craniocerebral trauma. Particularly preferably the present invention relates to the use of the combinations according to the invention for preparing a medicament for the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract including the lungs, such as for example allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibrosing alveolitis, COPD, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, asthma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, particularly COPD, chronic bronchitis and asthma. It is most preferable to use the combinations according to the invention for the treatment of inflammatory and obstructive diseases such as COPD, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, asthma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, particularly COPD, chronic bronchitis and asthma. It is also preferable to use the combinations according to the invention for the treatment of diseases of the peripheral or central nervous system such as depression, bipolar or manic depression, acute and chronic anxiety states, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, acute and chronic multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or acute and chronic pain as well as injuries to the brain caused by stroke, hypoxia or craniocerebral trauma. An outstanding aspect of the formulations according to the invention containing a combination of a compound of formula 1 and at least one NSAID is the reduced profile of side effects compared with formulations that contain the same compound of formula 1 in the same amount in the absence of an NSAID. Side effects that frequently occur when taking a PDE4 inhibitor preferentially include, inter alia, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. In the rat model further side effects were observed after the administration of PDE4 inhibitor, such as for example weight loss, leukocytosis and neutrophilia, as well as diarrhoea. By a reduced profile of side effects is meant, within the scope of the invention, in particular being able to administer a therapeutically effective dose of a PDE4 inhibitor in a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention without inducing to any appreciable extent in the patient the or at least one of the side effects commonly observed when PDE4 inhibitors are administered. It is particularly preferable to administer a therapeutically effective amount of a PDE4 inhibitor in the composition according to the invention at every stage of the course of the disease without triggering the typical PDE4 inhibitor-mediated side effects of diarrhoea, weight loss, leukocytosis or neutrophilia. In a particular aspect the present invention relates to the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention at every stage of the course of the disease without triggering the typical PDE4 inhibitor-mediated side effect of diarrhoea to any appreciable degree. Experiments on the rat model described hereinafter show that the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention containing a PDE4 inhibitor and at least one NSAID substantially reduce or even totally prevent many of the side effects which occur when the corresponding PDE4 inhibitor is administered on its own. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD Experiment 1 Diclofenac Provides Protection Against Roflumilast-Mediated Effects Such as Weight Loss, Leukocytosis, and Neutrophilia Six male Wistar rats in each group were treated for four days with the following substances (all substances are given p.o.=orally): Group 1 (“control group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at the times 0800, 1300 and 1700 hours. Group 2 (“roflumilast group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 3 (“roflumilast+diclofenac group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 1 mg/kg diclofenac (NSAID) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 4 (“diclofenac group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 1 mg/kg diclofenac (NSAID) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at 1300 hours. For pharmacokinetic analysis (determining the plasma levels of the substances) on day 4 one rat from each group was used; these rats were no longer available for other parameters under investigation. The same applied to one rat from the roflumilast group which died between day 4 and day 5 of the experiment. FIG. 1A shows the body weights of the rats from the different groups as a percentage change from the time of the first administration (=day 1, 0800 hours (=time t0)). The average±standard deviation of the body weights at time t0 was 355±17 g. At the end of the experiment (95 hours after t0 (=the time of the first administration on day 1, 0800)) the proportion of white blood cells (×1000 cells/μl blood, FIG. 1B, left-hand Figure) and the proportion of neutrophils (in % of white blood cells, FIG. 1B, right-hand Figure) were determined from the blood of 4 or 5 of the rats from the individual groups. Experiment 2 Diclofenac Provides Protection Against Roflumilast-Mediated Effects Such as Diarrhoea Six male Wistar rats in each group were treated for four days with the following substances (all substances are given p.o.=orally): Group 1 (“control group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at the times 0800, 1300 and 1700 hours. Group 2 (“roflumilast group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 3 (“roflumilast+diclofenac group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 1 mg/kg diclofenac (NSAID) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 4 (“diclofenac group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 1 mg/kg diclofenac (NSAID) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at 1300 hours. For pharmacokinetic analysis (determining the plasma levels of the substances) on day 4 one rat from each group was used; these rats were no longer available for other parameters under investigation. The same applied to one rat from the roflumilast group which died between day 4 and day 5 of the experiment. At the end of the experiment (95 hours after t0 (=the time of the first administration on day 1, 0800 hours)) the rats from the individual groups were examined phenotypically and histopathologically for the presence of multifocal perivascular mononuclear infiltration (=inflammation parameter) in the mesentery and for the proliferation of fibroblasts in the mesentery. In addition, the occurrence of diarrhoea in the rats from the different groups was noted. The findings are summarised in Table 1 as follows: TABLE 1 Phenotypical and histopathological findings roflumilast + Control roflumilast diclofenac diclofenac Parameter (group 1) (group 2) (group 3) (group 4) Diarrhoea 0/6 5/6 0/6 0/6 (=0 out of 6 animals) Mesentery: 0/5 4/4 0/5 0/5 multifocal peri- vascular mononuclear infiltration (=inflam- mation parameter) Mesentery: Prolifera- 0/5 4/4 0/5 0/5 tion of fibroblasts To summarise, it can be stated that the PDE4 inhibitor-mediated side effects such as weight loss (FIG. 1A), leukocytosis (FIG. 1B, on the left), neutrophilia (FIG. 1B, on the right) and diarrhoea (including the presence of inflammation parameters and the proliferation of fibroblasts in the mesentery) observed in the roflumilast group can be substantially reduced or prevented (often even reduced to the level found in the control group), by co-administering an NSAID such as diclofenac (cf. roflumilast+diclofenac group) simultaneously or only a few hours apart. The parameters measured after the administration of diclofenac alone were found to be very similar to the control groups. Experiment 3 The COX-2 Selective Inhibitor Lumiracoxib, but not the COX-1 Selective Inhibitor SC-560, Provides Protection from Roflumilast-Mediated Effects Such as Weight Loss, Leukocytosis and Neutrophilia Six male Wistar rats in each group were treated for four days with the following substances (all substances are given p.o.=orally): Group 1 (“control group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at the times 0800, 1300 and 1700 hours. Group 2 (“roflumilast group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 3 (“roflumilast+SC-560 group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 2 mg/kg SC-560 (NSAID, selective for COX-1) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 4 (“roflumilast+lumiracoxib group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 2 mg/kg lumiracoxib (NSAID, selective for COX-2) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg of reflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 5 (“SC-560 group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 2 mg/kg SC-560 (NSAID, selective for COX-1) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 0.5% Natrosol at 1300 hours. Group 6 (“lumiracoxib group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 2 mg/kg lumiracoxib (NSAID, selective for COX-2) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 0.5% Natrosol at 1300 hours. For pharmacokinetic analysis (determining the plasma levels of the substances) on day 4 one rat from each group was used; these rats were no longer available for other parameters under investigation. FIG. 2A shows the body weights of the rats from the different groups as a percentage change from the time of the first administration (=day 1, 0800 hours (=time t0)). The average±standard deviation of the body weights at time t0 was 306±11 g. At the end of the experiment (95 hours after t0 (=the time of the first administration on day 1, 0800 hours)) the proportion of white blood cells (×1000 cells/μl blood, FIG. 2B, left-hand Figure) and the proportion of neutrophils (in % of white blood cells, FIG. 2B, right-hand Figure) were determined from the blood of 5 of the rats from the individual groups. Experiment 4 The COX-2 Selective Inhibitor Lumiracoxib, but not the COX-1 Selective Inhibitor SC-560, Provides Protection from Roflumilast-Mediated Effects Such as Diarrhoea Six male Wistar rats in each group were treated for four days with the following substances (all substances are given p.o.=orally): Group 1 (“control group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at the times 0800, 1300 and 1700 hours. Group 2 (“roflumilast group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 0.5% Natrosol (placebo) at 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 3 (“roflumilast+SC-560 group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 2 mg/kg SC-560 (NSAID, selective for COX-1) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 4 (“roflumilast+lumiracoxib group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 2 mg/kg lumiracoxib (NSAID, selective for COX-2) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 10 mg/kg of roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) at 1300 hours. Group 5 (“SC-560 group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 2 mg/kg SC-560 (NSAID, selective for COX-1) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 0.5% Natrosol at 1300 hours. Group 6 (“lumiracoxib group”): Six male Wistar rats were given a daily dose of 2 mg/kg lumiracoxib (NSAID, selective for COX-2) at the times 0800 and 1700 hours and 0.5% Natrosol at 1300 hours. For pharmacokinetic analysis (determining the plasma levels of the substances) on day 4 one rat from each group was used; these rats were no longer available for other parameters under investigation. At the end of the experiment (95 hours after t0 (=the time of the first administration on day 1, 0800 hours)) the rats from the individual groups were examined phenotypically and histopathologically for the presence of multifocal perivascular mononuclear infiltration (=inflammation parameter) in the mesentery and for the proliferation of fibroblasts in the mesentery. In addition, the occurrence of diarrhoea in the rats from the different groups was noted. The findings are summarised in Table 2 as follows: TABLE 2 Phenotypical and histopathological findings roflumilast + roflumilast + control roflumilast SC-560 lumiracoxib SC-560 lumiracoxib Parameter (group 1) (group 2) (group 3) (group 4) (group 5) (group 6) Diarrhoea 0/6 (=0 von 2/6 0/6 0/6 0/6 0/6 6 Tieren) Mesentery: 0/5 5/5 4/5 0/5 0/5 0/5 multifocal perivascular mononuclear infiltration (= inflammation parameter) Mesentery: 0/5 5/5 4/5 0/5 0/5 0/5 Proliferation of fibroblasts To summarise, it can be stated that the PDE4 inhibitor-mediated side effects such as weight loss (FIG. 2A), leukocytosis (FIG. 2B, on the left), neutrophilia (FIG. 2B, on the right) and diarrhoea (including the presence of inflammation parameters and the proliferation of fibroblasts in the mesentery) observed in the roflumilast group can be substantially reduced or prevented (often even reduced to the level found in the control group), by co-administering a COX-2 selective NSAID such as lumiracoxib (cf. roflumilast+lumiracoxib) simultaneously or only a few hours apart. The COX-1 selective NSAID SC-560 has absolutely no protective effect on weight loss, leukocytosis and neutrophilia and only a very slight protective effect on the histopathological findings (multifocal perivascular mononuclear infiltration or proliferation of fibroblasts in the mesentery). It is difficult to make any pronouncements as to the effect of SC-560 on diarrhoea because in this experiment, in the roflumilast group, diarrhoea was only found per se in two animals. The parameters measured after the administration of SC-560 or lumiracoxib alone were found to be very similar to the control groups. To sum up, it can be concluded that the protective effect of an NSAID on the PDE4 inhibitor-mediated side effects are based on the inhibition of COX-2.

Suitable oral forms for administration are for example tablets, capsules, solutions, syrups or emulsions. The content of the pharmaceutically effective compound(s) in each case should be in the range from 0.1 to 90 wt. %, preferably 0.5 to 50 wt. % of the total composition, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient to achieve the dosage range specified hereinafter. The preparations may be administered orally in the form of a tablet, as a powder, as a powder in a capsule (e.g. a hard gelatine capsule), as a solution or suspension. It is particularly preferable if the preparations are administered once or twice a day. Suitable tablets may be obtained, for example, by mixing the active substance(s) with known excipients, for example inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, sorbitol, mannitol, isomaltose or lactose, disintegrants such as corn starch, crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium starch glycolate or alginic acid, binders such as starch, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatine, lubricants, such as magnesium stearate or talc, and/or agents for delaying release, such as hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, aminomethacrylate, polyvinylpyrrolidone-polyvinylacetate copolymer, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinylacetate. The tablets may also comprise several layers. Coated tablets or film-coated tablets may be prepared accordingly by coating cores produced analogously to the tablets with substances normally used for tablet or film coatings, for example collidone or shellac, gum arabic, talc, titanium dioxide, sugar, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, ethycellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, polymethacrylate, polyethyleneglycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol-polyethyleneglycol copolymers or polyvinylacetate. To achieve delayed release or prevent incompatibilities the core may also consist of a number of layers. Similarly the tablet coating may consist of a number of layers to achieve delayed release, possibly using the excipients mentioned above for the tablets. Syrups containing the active substances or combinations thereof according to the invention may additionally contain a sweetener such as saccharine, cyclamate, glycerol or sugar and a flavour enhancer, e.g. a flavouring such as vanillin or orange extract. They may also contain suspension adjuvants or thickeners such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, wetting agents such as, for example, condensation products of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, or preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates. Capsules containing one or more active substances or combinations of active substances may for example be prepared by mixing the active substances with inert carriers such as lactose or sorbitol and packing them into gelatine capsules. Suitable suppositories may be made for example by mixing with carriers provided for this purpose, such as neutral fats or polyethyleneglycol or the derivatives thereof. Excipients which may be used include, for example, water, pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvents such as paraffins (e.g. petroleum fractions), vegetable oils (e.g. groundnut or sesame oil), mono- or polyfunctional alcohols (e.g. ethanol or glycerol), carriers such as e.g. natural mineral powders (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk), synthetic mineral powders (e.g. highly dispersed silicic acid and silicates), sugars (e.g. cane sugar, lactose and glucose), emulsifiers (e.g. lignin, spent sulphite liquors, methylcellulose, starch and polyvinylpyrrolidone) and lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, stearic acid and sodium lauryl sulphate). For oral administration the tablets may, of course, contain, apart from the above-mentioned carriers, additives such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate together with various additives such as starch, preferably potato starch, gelatine and the like. Moreover, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate and talc may be used at the same time for the tabletting process. In the case of aqueous suspensions the active substances may be combined with various flavour enhancers or colourings in addition to the excipients mentioned above.
