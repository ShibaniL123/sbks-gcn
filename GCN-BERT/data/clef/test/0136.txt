STERILIZER Related Applications [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/989,187, filed on May 6, 2014, which is fully incorporated herein by reference. Field of the Invention [0002] The present invention relates to disinfection or deactivation of medical, dental, pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary instruments and devices and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for deactivating items and for maintaining the items in a deactivated state. Background of the Invention [0003] Medical, dental, pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary instruments and devices that are exposed to blood or other body fluids require thorough cleaning and anti-microbial deactivation between each use. It is not unusual during a medical procedure for a medical device that is being used during the procedure to require immediate cleaning, i.e., sterilization, to allow continued use of the device. For example, a medical device may be dropped to the floor or may come in contact with a non-sterile surface. Either situation would require sterilization of the instrument or device before further use. Sterilization processes that provide quick turnaround have historically been referred to as "flash" sterilization. More recently, the term "immediate use" sterilization is considered more appropriate. [0004] The present invention provides a sterilizer for "immediate use" sterilization, which sterilizer provides a container that maintains the sterilized device sterile during transport from the sterilizer to a surgical suite or other area of use. Summary of the Invention [0005] In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a sterilizer for sterilizing medical instruments. The sterilizer is comprised of a pressure vessel having an opening communicating with an interior cavity and a door assembly for closing and sealing the opening to the cavity. A sterilant inlet and a sterilant outlet communicate with the chamber. A container for holding medical instruments to be sterilized is provided. The container is comprised of a tray and a lid dimensioned to rest on the tray. The tray and lid define an interior area for holding medical instruments. The tray has connection means for connecting the sterilant inlet to the interior area of the tray when the tray is inserted in the cavity. The lid is movable from the tray when pressurized sterilant is introduced into the interior area of the container, the sterilant flowing past the lid to the sterilant outlet. [0006] One advantage of the present invention is the provision of a sterilizer for deactivating/sterilizing medical instruments and items. [0007] Another advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above that deactivates medical instruments and items using steam. [0008] Another advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above wherein the medical instruments are deactivated in a container comprised of a tray and a removable lid. [0009] A still further advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above wherein the interior and exterior of the container are exposed to steam within an enclosed sterilization chamber. [0010] A still further advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above that includes a door assembly that allows insertion and removal of the container into and out of the sterilization chamber. [0011] A still further advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above wherein the door assembly has a recessed cavity that forms part of the sterilization chamber. [0012] A still further advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above wherein the recessed cavity of the door assembly is dimensioned to receive the extending portion of the container. [0013] A still further advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above wherein the portion of the container that extends from the sterilization chamber is in the form of a handle that allows the user to grip the container. [0014] A still further advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above wherein the lid of the container is dimensioned to rest on the tray and is movable from the tray when steam is introduced into the container. [0015] A still further advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above wherein the door assembly includes a thermal insulating inner lining having a recessed area. [0016] A still further advantage of the present invention is a sterilizer as described above wherein the inner lining of the door assembly has a lower portion dimensioned to direct condensate toward a drain when the door is in a closed position. [0017] Another advantage of the present invention is the provision of a container for holding medical instruments and items during a sterilization process, which container maintains the instruments in a sterile environment during transfer from the sterilizer to a work environment. [0018] A still further advantage of the present invention is a container as described above that may be used to transport sterilized instruments in a sterile environment from the sterilizer to a working location. [0019] These and other advantages will become apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment taken together with the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.

In this respect, short wall portion 62a of flange 62 basically forms a dam or weir at front end 54 of pressure vessel 52. Pressure vessel 52 is oriented at a slight angle relative to flange 62. In other words, pressure vessel 52 is inclined relative to flange 62 and front panel 34 of housing 32, wherein pressure vessel 52 slopes slightly downwardly from closed back end 56 toward opened front end 54. [0049] A pair of spaced-apart rails 72, 74 is provided along the inner surface of pressure vessel 52. Rails 72, 74 are disposed near the bottom of inner cavity 58 and extend along the length of pressure vessel 52. In the embodiment shown, rails 72, 74 are preferably formed of the same metal used to form pressure vessel 52. Rails 72, 74 are preferably attached to the inner surface of pressure vessel 52 by welding. Inner edges 72a, 74a of rails 72, 74 define a channel 76 therebetween. Each rail 72, 74 defines an elongated, upward-facing flat surface 72b, 74b that extends along the length of inner cavity 58 of pressure vessel 52. Flat surfaces 72b, 74b of rails 72, 74 are coplanar to each other and define a support surface for supporting a container 300, as shall be defined in greater detail below. A strainer 82 is provided in channel 76 that is defined between inner edges 72a, 74a of rails 72, 74. Strainer 82 is provided to screen or filter solid particulate from condensate formed in inner cavity 58 during a sterilization cycle, as shall be described in greater detail below. Strainer 82 extends from closed, back end 56 of pressure vessel 52 to short wall 62a of flange 62 that extends across open, front end 54 of pressure vessel 52. A U-shaped clip 84 is attached to a front end of strainer 82 to attach onto short wall 62a of flange 62, as best seen in FIG. 10, to facilitate positioning and removal of strainer 82. [0050] Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, an elongated connector 92 extends into inner cavity 58 of pressure vessel 52 through closed, back end 56 of pressure vessel 52.

Mounting plate 242 is provided to support a sensor element 244 to detect the position of latch element 222 and an actuator 246 device to operatively engage latch element 222, as shall be described in greater detail below. In the embodiment shown, sensor element 244 is a magnetic sensor and actuator 246 is a solenoid having a movable pin 246a. [0061] Bracket 232 also includes a resilient biasing element 252 that is dimensioned to engage and bias latch element 222. In the embodiment shown, biasing element 252 is in the form of an elongated metallic strip having a free end 252a that is formed to define an offset tab portion 254 at free end 252a. Where offset tab portion 254 is formed, a recess or detent 256 is defined, as best seen in FIG. 12. Bracket 232 is preferably formed of a metallic material, such as steel, and is hardened such that biasing element 252 is a spring element. Biasing element 252 is dimensioned to engage latch element 222 in two different ways. [0062] In a first position, detent 256 of biasing element 252 captures an edge or corner of latch element 222, as illustrated in FIG. 13, wherein the biasing force of biasing element 252 exerted against latch element 222 holds latch element 222 in a first, "latch open," position, as seen in FIG. 13. In this position, latching tab 224 on latching element 222 is in a non-latching position relative to plate 132 of door assembly 130. In a second position, tab portion 254 of biasing element 252 is in contact with back-facing surface 222b of latch element 222, as best seen in FIG. 12. In this second position, latching tab 224 on latching element 222 is in a latching position relative to door plate 132 of door assembly 130. Door assembly 130 is held in the closed position by a latch assembly 210, as seen in FIG. 12. [0063] A door sensor 262 is mounted on flange 62 to determine when door assembly 130 is in a closed position. Sensor 262 is preferably a magnetic sensor. [0064] Door assembly 130 and pressure vessel 52 are each formed of a material capable of withstanding elevated temperatures and pressures. [0065] Sterilizer 50 is dimensioned to sterilize articles contained within container 300, best seen in FIGS. 14-24. Container 300 is dimensioned to be placed within pressure vessel 52. Container 300 is comprised of a tray, that is dimensioned to hold medical instruments to be sterilized, and a lid 390, that is dimensioned to rest upon tray 310. [0066] Tray 310 is generally rectangular in shape and has a front end 312 and a back end 314. Front end 312 includes a generally planar, front end wall 316. A U-shaped handle 322 extends outwardly from front end wall 316 of tray 310. Spaced-apart side walls 324, 326 extend from front end wall 316 and are connected to a back end wall 318 at back end 314 of tray 310. Each side wall 324, 326 has an upper portion 324a, 326a and a lower portion 324b, 326b, respectively. Spaced-apart ribs 327 are provided along the inner surface of upper portions 324a, 326a of sidewalls 324, 326 to reinforce the same. Lower portions 324b, 326b of side walls 324, 326 slope inwardly and communicate with a flat bottom wall 328. End walls 316, 318, side walls 324, 326, and bottom wall 328 define an interior area 332 within tray 310 for receiving the medical instruments to be sterilized. A compartment or housing 336 is molded or otherwise formed at back end 314 of the tray 310. Back end wall 318 of tray 310 forms the back wall of compartment 336, as shown in FIG. 4. In the embodiment shown, compartment 336 is molded as part of tray 310. Compartment 336 is generally trapezoidal in shape, as best seen in FIGS. 6 and 7. Compartment 336 defines an inner chamber 338 that is separated from the interior area 332 of tray 310. Compartment 336 defines an opening on the bottom or underside of tray 310. An insert 344 is dimensioned to be inserted into chamber 338 defined by compartment 336 and to close the opening at the lower end of compartment 336. Insert 344 includes a base plate 346 that is dimensioned to close the opening defined at the bottom of compartment 336. Conventional fasteners 348 extending through base plate 346 into molded regions 336a of compartment 336 attach base plate 346 to compartment 336, as seen in FIG. 7. Base plate 346 supports an intermediate wall 352 that is spaced from base plate 346 by a support 354. Spaced-apart side panels 356, 358 extend upwardly from intermediate wall 352. As best seen in FIG. 7, side panels 356, 358, intermediate wall 352, and support 354 are dimensioned to be narrower than compartment 336 and, thus, define a central chamber 362 and side chambers 364, 366 within compartment 336. A cylindrical opening 372 is formed in the back end wall 318 of tray 310 and communicates with central chamber 362 within compartment 336. Opening 372 is cylindrical in shape and is dimensioned to receive connector 92 attached to pressure vessel 52, as illustrated in the drawings. A slot 374 is formed in the base of compartment 336 to connect interior area 332 within tray 310 with space 353 defined between base plate 346 and intermediate wall 352 of insert 344. As best seen in FIG. 7, space 353 communicates with side chambers 364, 366, defined between insert 344 and compartment 336. Compartment 336, thus, defines a convoluted path between opening 372 in back end wall 318 and slot 374 at the base of compartment 336 in the bottom of tray 310. [0067] Tray 310 has an upper edge 378 that is generally rectangular in shape when viewed from above, as seen in FIG. 22. Upper edge 378 includes elevated portions 378a that extend along upper portions 324a, 326a of sidewalls 324, 326 and lower portions 378b that extend along the upper edges of front and back end walls 316, 318. [0068] A plurality of legs 382 extends from bottom wall 328 of tray 310. In the embodiment shown, four (4) spaced-apart legs 382 are provided on tray 310. Legs 382 are spaced-apart so as to rest upon rails 72, 74 in pressure vessel 52. Angled ramps 384, best seen in FIG. 17, extend from the bottoms of legs 382 to the underside of bottom wall 328 of tray 310. [0069] Lid 390 is generally cup-shaped and is dimensioned to mate, i.e., rest upon the upper edge 378 of tray 310. Lid 390 has a contoured top portion 392 having a flat top wall 394 and sloping side walls 396 that curve downwardly and away from flat top wall 394. A skirt or collar 412 is formed along the lower edge of the lid. Skirt or collar 412 is larger in profile than contoured portion 392 and is offset therefrom. A downward-facing, rectangular channel 414 is defined on the underside of lid 390 between contoured portion 392 and skirt 412. A continuous gasket 416 is disposed in channel 414 in lid 390. Channel 414 and gasket 416 are dimensioned to rest upon upper edge 378 of tray 310. Specifically, lid 390 is dimensioned to rest upon elevated portions 378a of sidewalls 324, 326 of tray 310. When lid 390 rests on elevated portions 378a of tray 310, a gap "G" is formed between gasket 416 and lower portions 378b along front and back end walls 316, 318 of tray 310, as best seen in FIGS. 7 and 10. Skirt portion 412 of lid 390 is dimensioned to be spaced from and to overlay and telescope over side walls 324, 326 and front and back end walls 316, 318 of tray 310 as shown in the drawings. Skirt 412 of lid 390 is dimensioned to loosely attach to tray 310. [0070] Lid 390 is molded in such a way as to include two recesses or depressions 422 that are separated by a wall 426. Recesses or depressions 422, 424 are disposed on opposite sides of lid 390 basically to define a grip or handle 428 for removing lid 390 from tray 310. Lid 390 and tray 310 are preferably each one-piece, molded elements formed of a high-temperature polymer material. [0071] According to one aspect of the present invention, the outer profile of container 300, i.e., tray 310 and lid 390, is dimensioned to fit closely within inner cavity 58 defined by pressure vessel 52. In this respect, a small space or gap "G" exists between lid 390 of container 300 and the inner surface of pressure vessel 52 when container 300 is disposed within sterilizer 50, as best seen in FIGS. 6 and 7. [0072] When container 300 is positioned within pressure vessel 52, connector 92 (i.e., the steam inlet) extends through opening 372 in back end wall 318 of tray 310, wherein the end of connector 92 communicates with central chamber 362 defined by compartment 336 within tray 310. Central chamber 362 communicates with space 353 formed by insert 344 via side chambers 364, 366 defined between side panels 356, 358 of insert 344 and the side walls of compartment 336. Gap 353 communicates with the interior of the tray through slot 374 at the base of compartment 336. [0073] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, when tray 310 is disposed within pressure vessel 52, handle 322 of tray 310 extends into cup-shaped recess 172 of liner 142 of door assembly 130. [0074] Referring now to the operation of sterilizer 50, one or more articles to be sterilized, such as medical, dental, pharmaceutical, veterinary or mortuary instruments, or other similar-sized devices are loaded into tray 310. A mesh tray or a silicone mat (not shown) may be placed in tray 310 to hold the instruments that are being sterilized. Lid 390 is then placed onto tray 310 and container 300 is then inserted into inner cavity 58 of pressure vessel 52 through the opening at front end 54 of sterilizer 50. Legs 382 of tray 310 rest upon and slide along flat surfaces 72b, 74b of rails 72, 74, as container 300 is inserted into pressure vessel 52. Ramps 384 on legs 382 facilitate insertion of container 300 into pressure vessel 52. Connector 92 at back end 56 of sterilizer 50 is disposed to be aligned with opening 372 in back end wall 318 of tray 310. Flange 98 on connector 92, abutting back end wall 318, acts as a stop to position container 300 within pressure vessel 52, as illustrated in FIG. 4. As seen in the drawing, the open end of connector 92 is disposed within central chamber 362 of compartment 336 when flange 98 on connector 92 abuts back end wall 318. [0075] With container 300 fully inserted into pressure vessel 52, door assembly 130 is moved to a closed position as shown in Figs. 3 and 5. In this respect, when door assembly 130 is in an open position (as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2), latch element 222 is in a position as shown in FIG. 13, where a back edge of latch element 222 is held in detent 256 of biasing element 252. As door assembly 130 moves from an open position to a closed position, door plate 132 engages paw 226 on latch element 222 and causes latch element 222 to move counterclockwise when viewed from above as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, wherein the back edge of latch element 222 moves onto tab portion 254 of biasing element 252, as shown in FIG. 12, and L-shaped tab 224 of latch element 222 captures the free edge of flat section 132a of door plate 132. Biasing element 252 maintains a biasing force on latch element 222 to maintain L-shaped tab 224 in the position shown in FIG. 12. [0076] According to one aspect of the present invention, latch element 222 is self locking. In this respect, the present invention provides a "fail-safe" mechanism when pressure is applied in the sterilization chamber. The greater the pressure within the inner cavity 58, the tighter the latch element 222 engages the door plate 132. [0077] As best seen in FIG. 3, when door assembly 130 is in a closed position, container 300 is contained within a sterilization chamber defined by inner cavity 58 of pressure vessel 52 and recess 146 of door assembly 130. As best seen in FIG. 5, a portion (i.e., the free end) of handle 322 extends into cup-shaped recess 172 of door assembly 130. [0078] Sensor 262 provides a signal to the system controller (not shown) when door assembly 130 is in a closed position. , Similarly, sensor 244 provides a signal when latching element 222 is in a "door-latching" position, as shown in FIG. 12. Only when both sensors simultaneously indicate that door assembly 130 is in a closed position and latching element 222 is in a door-latching position will the controller initiate a sterilization cycle. During a sterilization cycle, steam from an external source 96 is conveyed through inlet line 94 to pressure vessel 52 and container 300. The pressurized steam is forced into central chamber 362 of compartment 336, as illustrated by arrows "S" in FIG. 7. From central chamber 362, the steam flows over side panels 356, 358 and through side chambers 362, 364 to gap 353. From gap 353, the steam flows through slot 374 into the interior of tray 310. Steam within container 300 is allowed to exit container 300 through gaps "G" defined between tray 310 and lid 390. As the steam continues to be introduced into container 300, the pressure within container 300 will increase to where the steam pressure acting upon the underside of lid 390 will force lid 390 off of tray 310, as illustrated in FIG. 8. In effect, the configuration of lid 390 relative to tray 310 allows lid 390 to lift off tray 310 and release steam from container 300 into cavity 58 of pressure vessel 52. As shown in FIG. 8, the dimensions of inner cavity 58 limits the movement of lid 390 relative to tray 310. In addition, steam is forced into back end 56 of pressure vessel 52 and to the areas within pressure vessel 52 that surround container 300 through openings 99 in connector 92, as illustrated in FIG. 4. [0079] During a sterilization cycle, as pressure builds up within inner cavity 58 of pressure vessel 52, leg portions 152a, 152b of gasket 152 are forced outwardly against flat section 132a of door plate 132 and flange 62 of pressure vessel 52, respectively, by the pressure between leg portions 152a, 152b, thereby forming a seal between door plate 132 and flange 62. [0080] Steam or condensate is forced out of inner cavity 58 through sterilant outlet line 112 on the underside of pressure vessel 52. By positioning outlet line 112 at the lowest point within pressure vessel 52, steam or condensate collected within pressure vessel 52 may be withdrawn from pressure vessel 52 during operation of a sterilization cycle. [0081] After a predetermined period of time that is sufficient for the heated steam to decontaminate, i.e., sterilize, the medical instruments within container 300, the controller shuts down the flow of steam to pressure vessel 52. It is contemplated that clean, filtered air may be introduced into pressure vessel 52 to help dry the medical instruments within container 300. [0082] Once pressure has been released inside sterilizer 50, the controller unlocks door assembly 130 to allow the door to be opened. Door assembly 130 is unlocked or unlatched by the controller, actuating actuator 246 which causes pin 246a to engage latch element 222 and pivot L-shaped tab 224 of latch element 222 away from the edge of flat section 132a of door plate 132, as illustrated in FIG. 13. Actuator 246 causes the back edge of latch element 222 to move into detent 356 of biasing element 252 which holds the latch element 222 in an unlatched position, as shown in FIG. 13. U-shaped handle 322 extends partially from inner cavity 58 of pressure vessel 52, wherein container 300 can be easily grasped and withdrawn from pressure vessel 52, as illustrated in FIG. 10. [0083] As noted above, following a sterilization cycle, once pressure is removed from pressure vessel 52, lid 390 will settle back onto upper edge 378 of tray 310. As illustrated in the drawings, the distance lid 390 is allowed to move within pressure vessel 52 is less than the height of skirt 412 of lid 390, wherein lid 390 will never become completely separated from tray 310. [0084] It will be appreciated that the medical instruments may be relatively hot and that condensate may accumulate within tray 310 during a steam sterilizing cycle. The presence of condensate on the instruments within tray 310 does not affect the sterilization of the instruments or the availability of the instruments for use in a surgical procedure. [0085] The present invention thus provides a sterilizer 50 for flash sterilization of small quantities of medical instruments. The sterilization occurs in an easily handled container 300 that remains sterile following such sterilization. [0086] The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purposes of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof. 1.
