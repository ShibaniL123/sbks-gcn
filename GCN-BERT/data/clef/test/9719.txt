Synthesis of Compound 1
3.35 g (10 mmol) of Intermediate I-3, Cu(OAc)2, PPh3, 1,10-phenanthroline, and NaOAc were dissolved and stirred at a temperature of 80Â° C. for 12 hours. The obtained residue was cooled to room temperature, and an extraction process was performed thereon three times by using 30 mL of water and 30 mL of ethyl acetate. An organic layer obtained therefrom was dried by using magnesium sulfate and a solvent was removed therefrom by evaporation. Then, the residue obtained therefrom was separation-purified by silica gel column chromatography, thereby completing the preparation of 2.33 g (70%) of Compound 1. The obtained compound was identified by MS/FAB and 1H NMR.
