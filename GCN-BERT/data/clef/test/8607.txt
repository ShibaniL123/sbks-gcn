Step 1. Preparation of 5-trifluoromethyl-benzothiazolethiol
2.40 g of 2-bromo-5-trifluoromethyl-aniline and 1.21 g of potassium ethylxanthate were dissolved in 35 ml of DMF solution, reacted under refluxing at 120 degree centigrade, and then reacted overnight under stirring at room temperature. TLC detection was performed and it was confirmed that raw materials no longer decreased, and the reaction was completed. The product was washed with 25 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid solution, organic layer was extracted, combined and dried, and column chromatography was carried out to obtain 1.70 g of an oily liquid (yield 72%). Mass spectrum MS of the compound: [M+H]+ 235.2.
