EXAMPLE 114
3-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-2,6-dioxo-3-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl propionate (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 114)
114.1: 3-(3-benzhydryl-5-bromo-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl propionate
Similarly to example 2.2, starting from 1 g (2.8 mmol) of 1-benzhydryl-5-bromo-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as in example 2.1) and 608 mg (3.6 mmol) of methyl 3-bromopropionate, 1.1 g (85%) of 3-(3-benzhydryl-5-bromo-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl propionate is obtained in the form of a white solid.
