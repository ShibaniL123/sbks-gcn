Example 51-3 : Preparation of 4-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-6-morpholinopyrimidin-2-amine (LXXIV)
2-Amino-6-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-(1H)-one (100.0 mg, 336.58 µmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (3.36 mL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) (193.52 mg, 437.55 µmol), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) (75.5 µL, 504.86 µmol) and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. Morpholine (44.43 µL, 504.86 µmol) was added dropwise to the mixture and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hrs. The resulting solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate, diluted with ethylacetate, and washed with distilled water. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol = 15/1) to give the title compound (98 mg, 80 %).
