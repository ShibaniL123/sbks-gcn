Preparation of 2-chloro-3-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic acid (C206)
To a suspension of 2-chloro-3-fluorobenzoic acid (10 g, 57.5 mmol) in concentrated sulfuric acid (62 mL, 1149.5 mmol) was added concentrated nitric acid (4 mL, 86.2 mmol) dropwise at −10° C. and the reaction mixture was stirred between −10° C. and 0° C. for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was slowly poured into a beaker of crushed ice (˜1 L), and the resulting precipitated solid was filtered and washed with water (100 mL). The crude product was recrystallized from hot water to afford the title compound as an off-white solid (7.5 g, 60%): mp 163-165° C.;
