Prior Art Heretofore, a woman wearing a halter top blouse for golfing, for example, or other outdoor activities, who wished to stylize their attire before going into a more formal environment, such as a club house, or the like, had to change their blouse to provide a collared garment. The invention presents, as a simplified solution to an attire change, easily attachable and removable separate collar segments that, when installed to face oppositely from each of the halter top straps, form a collar that is open at the front and rear and gives the halter top the appearance of a collared garment where the collar segments can be connected along the halter top straps, changing the collar appearance. Also, for additional utility to the detachable halter top collar, the collar segments may each include a mounting section on the collar segment surface that, when the collar segment is installed, will be on the collar segment under surface, with each mounting to provide for attachment to an end of a removable shawl and hood accessory. Whereby, when the shawl is fitted to the collar segments and installed on the halter top straps, it will drape from the wearer's neck and down their back, and, when pulled up over their head, becomes a hood. The unique combination of clothing accessories provides the wearer with attractive additions to their halter top that greatly enhances the functionality thereof, providing a garment that is suitable for wear in a number of different environments. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a principal object of the present invention is to provide attachable clothing accessories for a woman's halter top that are easily installed onto and removed from the halter top straps to change the appearance of the halter top to accommodate different social circumstances. Another object of the present invention is to provide collar segments as clothing accessories for the halter top that are individually secured to each of the halter top straps and are then folded over and across each strap to provide the halter top with an open collar. Still another object of the present invention is to provide attach points on each collar segment on its undersurface that, after the collar segment is folded over the halter top strap, each provide a convenient attachment point for an end of a shawl and hood accessory that, when so installed, will drape from the wearer's neck area, across the halter top straps, from the woman's neck area, and down her back, to function as a shawl. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a shawl and hood accessory that, when fitted to the collar segments can be lifted over the woman's head to function as a hood. The invention is in accessory clothing items for convenient connection onto straps of a woman's halter top type blouse to lend utility to the garment such that the wearer can adapt the garment to a number of social situations by releasably adding collar segments to the halter top straps and, as appropriate, releasably connecting ends of a shawl and hood onto each of the collar segments that allow the shawl to drape from the collar segments and down the wearer's back from their neck area, and which shawl can be pulled up over the wearer's head, to function as a hood.
