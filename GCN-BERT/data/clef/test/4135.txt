Step 2
The compound 61 (2.00 g, 7.32 mmol) and trimethylsilyl isothiocyanate (10.32 mL, 73.20 mmol) were stirred at 150Â°C for 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Diethyl ether (10 mL) was added to the mixture. The obtained solids were filtered to give the compound 62 (1.53 g, yield 73%).
