The present invention relates to a hair care composition comprising non-linear polymers. US 2007/202071 discloses compositions comprising dendritic molecules as emulsifying agents. However, by their physical nature such dendritic molecules are not capable of delivering the benefits of the invention. In addition, whereas dendritic macromolecules decreasing the volume of hair have been disclosed before in hair care compositions, the invention shows that compositions in which the hydrophobically modified dendritic macromolecule is emulsified prior to incorporation into the composition have even lower volume compared to those compositions with dendritic macromolecules that are not emulsified. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a hair care composition according to claim 1. Dendritic macromolecules are macromolecules with densely branched structures having a large number of end groups. A dendritic polymer JncJudes several layers or generations of repeating units which all contain one or more branch points. Dendritic polymers, including dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers, are prepared by condensation reactions of monomeric units having at least two different types of reactive groups. Dendrimers are highly symmetric, whereas macromolecules designated as hyperbranched may to a certain degree hold an asymmetry, yet maintaining the highly branched treelike structure. Dendritic macromolecules normally consist of an initiator or nucleus having one or more reactive sites and a number of branching layers and optionally a layer of chain terminating molecules. Continued replication of branching layers normally yields increased branch multiplicity and, where applicable or desired, increased number of terminal groups. The layers are usually called generations and the branches dendrons. In a preferred embodiment the dendritic macromolecule to be hydrophobically modified is a hydroxyl-functionalised dendritic macromolecule and more preferably one which comprises polyester units. Suitable materials are described in SE 468 771, which discloses a macromolecule which is composed of an initiator, having at least one hydroxyl group, to which initiator is added at least one branching generation comprising at least one chain extender, having at least one carboxyl group and at least two hydroxyl groups. Further suitable materials are described in SE 503 342, in which the macromolecule is substantially composed of a nucleus, having at least one epoxide group, to which nucleus is added at least one branching generation comprising at least one chain extender, having at least three reactive functions of which at least one is a carboxyl or epoxide group and at least one is a hydroxyl group. These materials are also referred to as polyhydric polyester alcohols or hyperbranched polyols. Preferably these materials have at least eight, more preferably at least sixteen, most preferably at least thirty-two terminal hydroxyl groupings per macromolecule. Their molecular weight is preferably at least 800, more preferably at least 1600, most preferably at least 2500 g/mole. These materials are available commercially from Perstorp AB, SE-284 Perstorp, Sweden under the trademark of BOLTORN. Examples of such materials are BOLTORN H10, BOLTORN H20, BOLTORN H30 and BOLTORN H40, of which BOLTORN H30 and BOLTORN H40 are preferred. It is preferred if the generation number of the polymer is 2 or greater. The maximum generation number is preferably 9 or less, more preferably 7 or less. Preferred hydrophobically functionalised dendritic macromolecules are built up from polyester units. Suitable macromolecules of this type are disclosed in US 5 418 301 and can be sold under the tradename Perstop. Other preferred dendritic macromolecules are built up from polyamide units. Suitable macromolecules of this type are disclosed in Macromolecules 2001, 34, 3559-3566 and are sold under the tradename Hybrane. Preferably the groups are selected from succinic anhydride units, dodecyl succinJc anhydride units, hexahydrophthalic anhydride units and phthalic anhydride units or mixtures thereof. The level of hydrophobically functionalised dendritic macromolecule is preferably from 0.0001 to 30 wt% of the total composition, more preferably the level is from 0.05 to 8 wt%, most preferably from 0.1 to 5 wt%. Preferably the number average molecular weight of the polymers are from 500 to 50,000, more preferably the number average molecular weight to from 500 to 10,000; most preferably the number average molecular weight is from 750 to 5,000. Preferably, the dendritic macromolecule comprises polyester, polyether, po]yamide, polyanhydride units or mixtures thereof. In a particular embodiment the dendritic macromolecule comprises units selected from succinic anhydride units, dodecyl succinic anhydride units, hexahydrophthalic anhydride units and phthalic anhydride units or mixtures thereof. Hydrophobic modification Preferred hydrophobic groups are carbon based. 0 4 -0 24 alkyl or alkenyl groups are preferred hydrophobic groups, more preferred are 0 6 -0 22 alkyl or alkenyl groups, especially preferred are C 8 -C 6 alkyl or alkenyl groups, most preferred are dendritic macromolecule having C 10 -C 14 alkyl or alkenyl groups. The hydrophobic groups may include linear and branched hydrophobes as well as arylalkyl groups, however it is preferred if the alkyl hydrophobic groups are linear. The hydrophobic groups may be unsaturated groups but are preferably saturated. The hydrophobic groups are sometimes linked to the dendritic macromolecule through linking groups, suitable linking groups include ester or amide groups. In some instances it is preferred if the dendritic macromolecule is fully or partially hydrophobically functionalised at the periphery and/or the terminal groups of the dendritic macromolecule. (In the context of the present invention the term periphery means the outer layer or edge of the dendritic macromolecule.) Where the dendritic macromolecule is hydrophobically functionalised at the periphery preferably 5 to 95% of the terminal groups are hydrophobically functionalised, more preferably from 10 to 85%, most preferably from 20 to 60%. In a further embodiment the number of hydrophobic groups can be expressed as a percentage of the potential sites on the dendritic macromolecule available for hydrophobic modification both on the periphery of the molecule and internally within the molecule. Preferably 10 to 90 % of these available sites are hydrophobically modified, more preferably 20 to 70% are hydrophobically modified. Hydrophobic modification is a simple process of reacting with the relevant fatty acid, fatty ester or fatty anhydride. Examples of hydrophobically modified dendritic polymers include those commercially available as Boltorn H2004 and Bottom W3000. Preferably the composition is a shampoo composition and comprises materials commonly found in shampoo compositions such as silicones; cleansing surfactants such as anionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, nonionic surfactants and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the composition according to the invention is a conditioning composition. Conditioning compositions according to the invention will comprise conditioning surfactants and actives such as silicones, fatty materials selected from alcohols, acids, amides and mixtures thereof.
