Pop/11.02.2014 Similar compounds are described for example in WO2011/117264 as modulators of phosphodiesterase 10Α (PDE10A) for the treatment of central nervous system diseases and in W02010/068453 and W02010/068452 as modulators of fatty acid amide hydrolase. 2-Aryl-3-(heteroaryl)-imidazo(l,2-a)pyrimidines are described in WOOl34605 for the treatment of conditions alleviated by the reduction of inflammatory cytokines. It has been shown that the present compounds may be used for binding and imaging tau aggregates and related beta-sheet aggregates including besides others beta-amyloid aggregates or alpha-synuclein aggregates, especially for use in binding and imaging tau aggregates in Alzheimer patients. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, irreversible memory loss, disorientation and language impairment (Arch. Neurol. 1985, 42(11), 1097-1105). Postmortem examination of AD brain sections reveals abundant senile plaques (SPs), composed of beta amyloid (Αβ) peptides, and numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Tau belongs to the family of microtubule-associated proteins and is mainly expressed in neurons where it plays an important role in the assembly of tubulin monomers into microtubules to constitute the neuronal microtubule network as tracks for axonal transport (Brain Res. Rev. 2000, 33(1), 95-130). Tau is translated from a single gene located on chromosome 17 and the expression is developmentally regulated by an alternative splicing mechanism generating six different isoforms in the human adult brain that can be distinguished by their number of binding domains. The underlying mechanisms leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, misfolding and aggregation are not well understood, but the deposition of tau aggregates follows a stereotyped spatiotemporal pathway both at the intracellular levels as well as on the level of brain topography. The recent discovery of tau gene mutations leading to frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 has reinforced the predominant role attributed to tau in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and underlined the fact that distinct sets of tau isoforms expressed in different neuronal populations could lead to different pathologies (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 2005, 1739(2) 240-250). Neurodegenerative diseases characterized by pathological tau accumulation are termed ‘tauopathies’ (Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2001, 24, 1121-1159). Besides AD and FTD, other tauopathies include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), tangle-predominant dementia, Pick's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Down’s syndrome and others. A direct correlation has been established between the progressive involvement of neocortical areas and the increasing severity of dementia, suggesting that pathological tau aggregates such as NFTs are a reliable marker of the neurodegenerative process. The degree of NFT involvement in AD is defined by Braak stages (Acta Neuropathol. 1991, 82, 239-259). Braak stages I and II are defined when NFT involvement is confined mainly to the transentorhinal region of the brain, stages III and IV are diagnosed when limbic regions such as the hippocampus are involved, and stages V and VI when extensive neocortical involvement is found. Presently, detection of tau aggregates is only possible by histological analysis of biopsy or autopsy materials. In vivo imaging of tau pathology would provide novel insights into deposition of tau aggregates in the human brain and allow to non-invasively examine the degree of tau pathology, quantify changes in tau deposition over time, assess its correlation with cognition and analyze the efficacy of an anti-tau therapy. Potential ligands for detecting tau aggregates in the living brain must cross the blood-brain barrier and possess high affinity and specificity for tau aggregates. To this end, successful neuroimaging radiotracers must have appropriate lipophilicity (logD 1-3) and low molecular weight (<450), show rapid clearance from blood and low non-specific binding. The object of the present application is to find an imaging tool which will improve diagnosis by identifying potential patients with excess of tau aggregates in the brain, which may be likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. It will also be useful to monitor the progression of the disease. When an anti-tau aggregate drug become available, imaging tau tangles in the brain may provide an essential tool for monitoring treatment. A further object of the present invention is a method of imaging tau-aggregate deposits, comprising - introducing into a mammal a detectable quantity of a composition - allowing sufficient time for the compound of formula I to be associated with tau-aggregate deposits, and - detecting the compound associated with one or more tau-aggregate deposits. A further object of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition, containing compounds of formula I and pharmaceutical acceptable carriers, which may be used for identifying potential patients. The following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination. As used herein, the term "lower alkyl" denotes a saturated, i.e. aliphatic hydrocarbon group including a straight or branched carbon chain with 1-7 carbon atoms.

In more detail, the compounds of formula I can be manufactured by the methods given below, by the methods given in the examples or by analogous methods. Appropriate reaction conditions for the individual reaction steps are known to a person skilled in the art. The reaction sequence is not limited to the one displayed in schemes 1 to 4, however, depending on the starting materials and their respective reactivity the sequence of reaction steps can be freely altered. Starting materials are either commercially available or can be prepared by methods analogous to the methods given below, by methods described in references cited in the description or in the examples, or by methods known in the art. According to scheme 1, compounds of formula I wherein the substituents R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above can be prepared via consecutive alkylation reactions of amines V with suitable alkylation reagents, e.g. methyl iodide or an alkyl halide in presence of a base, e.g. sodium hydride in a suitable solvent, e.g. DMF at ambient or elevated temperature. Alternatively, amine V is first converted into a protected amine V-a via reaction with a suitable reagent, e.g. di-tertbutyldicarbonate, in a suitable solvent, followed by an alkylation reaction with a suitable alkylation reagent, e.g. methyliodine or an alkyl halogenide in presence of a base, e.g. sodium hydride in a suitable solvent, e.g. DMF at ambient or elevated temperature. Deprotection is then leading to compounds of formula I. According to scheme 2, an activated ketone IV wherein R1 is as defined above and X is a leaving group, e.g. Cl or Br is reacted with aminopyrimidines III wherein the substituents R2 and R3 are as defined above in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetone or ethanol, at elevated temperature to afford compounds of formula I. Aminopyrimidines III can be synthesized starting from 2-amino-4-chloropyrimidine VI by heating with amines HNR2R3 and a suitable base, e.g. potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate, in a suitable solvent, e.g. sulfolane or ΝΜΡ, at elevated temperature or by heating with amines HNR2R3 in water at elevated temperature. According to scheme 3, compounds of formula I wherein the substituents R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above can also be prepared by coupling of an activated ketone IV wherein R1 is as defined above and X is a leaving group, e.g. Cl or Br with aminopyrimidines VII wherein X is a leaving group, e.g. Cl or Br in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetone or ethanol, at elevated temperature to afford compounds of formula II. Transition-metal mediated coupling of II with an amine I INR'r2 in presence of a suitable metal source, e.g. Pd2(dba)3 a suitable ligand or additive, e.g. xantphos in a suitable solvent, e.g. dioxane and in presence of a suitable base, e.g. cesium carbonate at elevated temperature is affording compounds of formula I. According to scheme 4, compounds of formula I wherein the substituents R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above can also be prepared by alkylation of phenols VIII using a suitable alkylation reagent, e.g. alkyl halides like 1-fluoroethyl bromide or alkyl tosylates like fluoromethyl tosylate, in presence of a suitable base, e.g. cesium carbonate or sodium hydride, in a suitable solvent, e.g. DMF, at ambient or elevated temperature. In analogy, phenols IX can be alkylated to afford compounds of formula II which are then further transformed into compounds of formula I. Compounds, wherein the substitution on R1 is 3H , OC(3H)3, OnCH3 or OCH2CH218F or R3 is C(3H)3 or nCH3, may be prepared in conventional manner starting from compounds of formula I or compounds of formula V as described in the specific examples 100 to 106. Isolation and purification of the compounds Isolation and purification of the compounds and intermediates described herein can be effected, if desired, by any suitable separation or purification procedure such as, for example, filtration, extraction, crystallization, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, thick-layer chromatography, preparative low or high-pressure liquid chromatography or a combination of these procedures. Specific illustrations of suitable separation and isolation procedures can be had by reference to the preparations and examples herein below. However, other equivalent separation or isolation procedures could, of course, also be used. Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of formula I can be separated using chiral HPLC. Salts of compounds of formula I The compounds of formula I are basic and may be converted to a corresponding acid addition salt. The conversion is accomplished by treatment with at least a stoichiometric amount of an appropriate acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. Typically, the free base is dissolved in an inert organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol or methanol and the like, and the acid added in a similar solvent. The temperature is maintained between 0 °C and 50 °C. The resulting salt precipitates spontaneously or may be brought out of solution with a less polar solvent. The acid addition salts of the basic compounds of formula I may be converted to the corresponding free bases by treatment with at least a stoichiometric equivalent of a suitable base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, ammonia, and the like. The compounds were investigated in accordance with the test given hereinafter. TAU Radioligand-In-Vitro Displacement assay This in vitro binding assay assesses the affinity of compounds for native tau aggregates. The compounds are co-incubated with the well-established tau specific radioligand [3H]T808 and the compound’s displacement potency of [3H]T808 binding is determined by in vitro autoradiography using human Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain sections (see illustration below). [3H]T808[10nM] + cold substance [1μΜ] - Τ808 Cpd A Cpd Β Cpd C , i , control Low affinity High affinity No affinity Materials AD human brains are purchased from Banner Sun Health Research Institute (Sun City, ΑΖ, USA). Pathological diagnosis of AD is made according to standard NIA-Reagan Institute criteria based on neuropathological data. The radioligand [3H]T808 was synthesized in-house ([3H]-2-[4-(2-Fluoro-ethyl)-piperidin-l-yl]-benzo[4,5]imidazo[l,2-a]pyrimidine, radiochemical purity 99.0 %). As a reference cold Τ808 is used (2-[4-(2-Fluoro-ethyl)-piperidin-l-yl]benzo[4,5]imidazo[l,2-a]pyrimidine). For the autoradiography FujiFilm Imaging Plates (BAS-IP TR 2025) are exposed to the sections and read with a FujiFilm IP reader (BAS-5000). Method Ten pm thick human AD brain sections are generated with a cryostat (Leica CM3050) at -17 °C chamber temperature and -15 °C object temperature. Sections are transferred to Histobond+ microscope slides (Marienfeld Laboratory Glasware). After drying for 3 hours at room temperature the sections are stored at -20 °C. The sections are incubated with the radioligand (10 ηΜ) and the respective cold compound (at various concentrations) in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 at room temperature for 30 min. After washing 3χ 10 min at 4 °C in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 and 3 quick dips in Η2Ο dist. at 4 °C the sections are dried at 4 °C for 3 h. The sections are placed in a FujiFilm Cassette (BAS 2025), exposed with an Imaging Plate for five days and afterwards scanned with a resolution of 25 μΜ per pixel. Data analysis The signal intensity (Dens - PSL/mm2) in the region of interest (ROI) of the autoradiogram is quantified with the software MCID analysis (version 7.0, Imaging Research Inc.).The specific binding (SB) of [3H]T808 binding in absence or in presence of a compound is calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding signal in the white matter, thus yielding SB[3H]tso8 only and SBcompund- The % displacement by the various compounds is calculated as following: % displacement =100-(SBcompUnd/SB[3H]T808 only)* 100. Validation data In each experiment cold Τ808 is used as a positive internal control. Co-incubation of equimolar amounts of hot and cold Τ808 is expected to reduce specific binding by approximately 50 %. References Α.Κ.
