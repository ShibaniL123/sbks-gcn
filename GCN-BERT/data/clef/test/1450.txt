TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure generally relates to wheelchairs, and more particularly to wheelchairs with a waste disposal system configured to allow a user to expel waste material without moving out of the wheelchair. BACKGROUND Incontinence and over-active bladders often present a challenge to those in wheelchairs. Indeed, millions of people in wheelchairs, and those who have to sit for extended periods of time, are at the mercy of their caregivers. Urologic issues or not, most people in wheelchairs, especially seniors, are often constantly wet from urine and fecal-soaked diapers. Damp, wet diapers prevent external genitalia from drying, causing irritation to the skin, which sets the stage for skin rashes, bed sores, vaginitis, Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), etc. As a result, many seniors purposely dehydrate themselves to avoid urination. Many people with multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's, Diabetes, cancer or surgical patients have or develop urinary issues. Devices have been developed to address incontinence and overactive bladders. However, such devices are typically invasive and/or complex. Indeed, such devices are often uncomfortable and lead to many unwanted urologic issues and infections. For example, such devices are do not address the fact that the cushions need to be very comfortable. Comfortable cushions are important during long term sitting to prevent pressure sores on the skin and are hence an important feature for wheelchair users. Rigid cushions are not conducive for long term sitting. Disposable diapers, incontinence pads and undergarments with absorbents provide an alternative to the complex devices discussed above. However, these disposable alternatives present undesirable issues as they never dry and remain wet. Furthermore, there is no means to convey the urine and waste away from the diaper, pad or undergarment. The disposable alternatives are also not environmentally friendly. There remains a need to provide both men and women with a comfortable, non-invasive waste collection/disposal device for a comfortable seated position in order to remain dry. The present disclosure provides an improvement over prior art technologies. SUMMARY Accordingly, a wheel chair with a waste disposal system is provided.

In some embodiments, drainage member 112 can be variously connected with funnel 66, such as, for example, monolithic, integral connection, frictional engagement, threaded engagement, mutual grooves, screws, adhesive, nails, barbs and/or raised element. A collection container 122 is positioned below second end 120 and is configured to catch voided waste material that moves out of second end 120. A cavity 123 defined by an inner surface of collection container 122 has a maximum diameter that is greater than that of drainage member 112 such that at least a portion of second end 120 is positioned within cavity 123. In some embodiments, at least one of crossbars 32, 34 includes a bracket 125 that fits under a lip 124 at a first end 130 of collection container 122 to prevent collection container 122 from touching a floor F upon which wheels 36, 38, 40, 42 rest. In some embodiments, a stabilization member, such as, for example, a strap 126 extends between second horizontal rails 30. Strap 126 includes a hook 128 rotatably disposed on strap 126. Hook 128 fits under lip 124 at a second end 132 of collection container 122 to prevent collection container 122 from touching floor F. In some embodiments, collection container 122 is a bag, bottle or bucket. In some embodiments, collection container 122 is removable from wheelchair 20 without removing drainage member 112. In some embodiments, collection container 122 and drainage member 112 are monolithic such that collection container 122 and drainage member 112 are removable from wheelchair 20 as a single piece. In some embodiments, at least one of wheels 36, 38, 40, 42 include a cover 134 configured to conceal collection container 122 from view, when viewed in a direction that is parallel to transverse rails 46. In some embodiments, a first protection flap 136 extends perpendicularly from a rearward one of transverse rails 46 to conceal collection container 122 from view, when viewed in a direction that is parallel to second horizontal rails 30 from a rear of wheelchair 20. In some embodiments, a second protection flap similar to first protection flap 136 extends perpendicularly from a front one of transverse rails 46 to conceal collection container 122 from view, when viewed in a direction that is parallel to second horizontal rails 30 from a front of wheelchair 20. In operation and use, first cushion 52 is positioned relative to seat 44 such that strips 64a, 64b engage strips 55a, 55b to fix first cushion relative to seat 44 and first aperture 58 is in communication with throughhole 48. Funnel 66 is positioned in first aperture 58 such that bottom surface 74 engages upper surface 60 and second end 70 extends through throughhole 48. Second cushion 96 is positioned relative to first cushion 52 such that strips 110a, 110b engage strips 108a, 108b to fix second cushion 96 relative to first cushion 52. Drainage member 112 is coupled to funnel 66 such that passageway 116 is in communication with channel 82. Collection container 122 is positioned relative to drainage member 112 such that passageway 116 is in communication with cavity 123. This configuration allows voided waste material, such as, for example, urine and/or feces, to be deposited in second aperture 104 while a user sits upon second cushion 96. The voided waste material moves through aperture 104 into front portion 92 and/or back portion 94. The voided waste material moves through front portion 92 and/or back portion 94 and into second portion 78. The voided waste material moves through channel 82 and into passageway 116. The voided waste material moves through passageway 116 and into cavity 123. Once the voided waste material is deposited in cavity 123, collection container 122 can be removed from wheelchair 20 and replaced with a second, clean collection container 122. In some embodiments, bracket 125 is positioned under lip 124 at a first end 130 of collection container 122 and hook 128 is under lip 124 at second end 132 of collection container 122 to prevent collection container 122 from touching floor F. In some embodiments, seat 44 forms a portion of a piece of furniture, such as, for example, a chair that lacks wheels to accommodate users that are not in wheelchairs, yet may not always be able to stand and walk to a bathroom to void waste material, such as, for example, urine and/or feces. It is envisioned that such devices may be useful for seniors as well as children and infants, who are not fully potty trained. It is therefore beneficial to provide seat 44 in stationary items of furniture. In such embodiments, seat 44 may be fixed to a frame of a stationary item of furniture, such as, for example, a chair. In some embodiments, a cushion of the chair is removed and seat 44 is replaced with the cushion. First cushion 52 is positioned relative to seat 44 such that strips 64a, 64b engage strips 55a, 55b to fix first cushion relative to seat 44 and first aperture 58 is in communication with throughhole 48. Funnel 66 is positioned in first aperture 58 such that bottom surface 74 engages upper surface 60 and second end 70 extends through throughhole 48. Second cushion 96 is positioned relative to first cushion 52 such that strips 110a, 110b engage strips 108a, 108b to fix second cushion 96 relative to first cushion 52. Drainage member 112 is coupled to funnel 66 such that passageway 116 is in communication with channel 82.
