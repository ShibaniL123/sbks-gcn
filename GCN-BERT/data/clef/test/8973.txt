Synthesis of compound 51-b
Under N2 atmosphere, at -78°C, a solution of 2.5M n-butyl lithium in n-hexane (2.05mL, 5.1mmol) was added to a solution of diisopropylamine (0.72mL, 5.1mmol) in anhydrous THF (20mL). The mixture was warmed to room temperature, stirred for 1h, cooled again to -78°C. The mixture was added to methyl isobutyrate (0.59mL, 5.1mmol), stirred for 1h, followed by adding compound 51-c (300mg, 1.02mmol) and further stirred for 1h. The mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature, stirred for 2hrs, followed by adding saturated NH4Cl aq. solution (20mL), being extracted with EA (50mL×2). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica column chromatography (PE:EA = 3:1) to give yellow oil 51-b (300mg, yield 91%).
