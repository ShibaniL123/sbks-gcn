A BRASSIERE OR GARMENT ACCESSORY The present invention relates to a garment accessory over a confined part of a user's body and in particular to a brassiere accessory. The accessory is used with a garment, typically a brassiere, by a wearer to adjust the support provided to individual breasts by a brassiere cup or the like, to modify the presented shape of one or both breasts and/or the relative positions of each breast. The invention also includes methods of using such an accessory. With a garment such as a coat or a top or a dress or a pair of trousers or jeans the accessory could then allow an adjustment of a gap or tension in the garment for individual user's requirements and taste. Women frequently want to enhance their breast cleavage, for example, when wearing a low cut dress or a breast-revealing or defined garment such as a blouse. Typically women have needed to purchase a specialist brassiere to allow such adjustment, for example: a brassiere where a bridge portion between the cups may be length-adjusted. Such solutions require deviations from normal brassiere design that may make the garment uncomfortable for everyday use. Also, as women typically need a collection of brassieres of differing colour and style whilst the choice of such adjustable specialist brassieres in varying colours and styles may be quite limited. Many women have breasts of slightly different shape or size (so-called asymmetric breasts). Prior-art brassieres typically have provided adjustable shoulder straps to allow a wearer to modify the support provided to individual breasts. Such adjustment can be in order to try and make the breasts appear symmetrical but such measures frequently do not provide a complete solution and/or result in an uncomfortable brassiere. It will also be understood that some women have had surgery which may cause a lack of symmetry in their breasts whilst still as well as in motion with different responses to the weight of each breast by the straps. In view of the above, there is a need to provide an accessory that can be attached to a wide variety of conventional brassieres such that breast cleavage can be adjusted and/or asymmetric breasts can be disguised so as seen as more symmetrical and even. An objective of the present invention is to provide an accessory that can be readily attached to and detached from various brassieres or a similar garments such 5 that with a brassiere the accessory can provide additional breast support to allow a wearer to comfortably adjust breast cleavage and/or disguise asymmetric breasts. In accordance with aspects of the present invention there is provided a brassiere or garment accessory (10) comprising: first and second portions (12, 14) having attachment means that allow releasable attachment to any user-selected i o part of a first and second portions (C1 , C2) of said brassiere (B) or a garment respectively; and further comprising tension means (16) that in use operably cooperates with said first and second portions (12, 14) to pull (by means of a tension force F) or hold these portions together and the connected portions (C1 and C2) of the brassiere or garment directly towards each other; so that in use by appropriate 1 5 positioning of the said first and second portions (12, 14) on the first and second portions on the brassiere or garment (C1 and C2) a wearer of the combined brassiere (B) or garment with the accessory (10) may adjust the shape of one or both of her breasts or underlying body parts adjacent a garment and/or their relative positions. 0 The accessory may be of a fixed length or variable length. The accessory may be arranged to be substantially flat or overlay part of the garment through the attachment means. 5 Preferably, in either of the above aspects, the first portion and the second portion are individual items and the releasable tension means comprises means that allow these individual items in use to be directly connected and disconnected to provide said tension force (F). Preferably, the individual items are (in use) connected side-by-side. 0 Alternatively, the first and second portion may form part of a single (integral) item and thus may not (in use) be connected and disconnected with the tension means possibly defined by the size and/or shape and/or configuration of the single item. Preferably, in either of the above aspects, the first portion attachment means or second portion attachment means comprise a pin that in use fully penetrates the fabric of the first cup and/or the second cup or garment. Preferably, in either of the above aspects, the first portion attachment means or second portion attachment means comprise a loop fastener configured so that it can detachably engage a separate profiled stud such that the fabric of at least one of the cups or parts of the garment are held between the separate stud and the loop. Preferably, the first and/or second portion (individual items) or the accessory as a whole further comprises a decorative item(s) and/or surfaces. For example, the front face portions may further comprise a decorative surface. The accessory may be fabricated, at least in part, from a plastics material so that the component parts exhibit at least some flexibility. In another aspect the invention comprises a method of disguising asymmetric breasts using an accessory according to the present invention and comprising the following steps: (a) Attaching separated said first and second portions of the accessory to said first and second cups of a brassiere or garment using said attachment means; (b) Applying a direct tension (F) between said first and second portions or attachment means using said tension means; and (c) During step (a) positioning said attachment means asymmetrically (on adjacent cups) such that more support is provided to a first cup with a first breast than to a second cup with a second breast, thereby compensating for a wearer's asymmetric first and second breasts. In another aspect the invention comprises a method of compensating for uneven sized breasts using an accessory according to the present invention comprising the steps of: (a) Attaching separately said first and second portions of an accessory to said first and second cups of a brassiere or garment using respective first and second attachment means; (b) Applying a direct tension (F) between said first and second portions or attachment means using said tension means of the accessory; and (c) Positioning said attachment means asymmetrically (on adjacent cups) such that less support is provided to the first cup (supporting a larger breast) than to the second cup (supporting a smaller breast) by: positioning said second attachment means lower down the second cup and further from the centre of the brassiere than said first attachment means on the first cup; and thereby compensating for a wearer's uneven sized breasts. Aspects of the present invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein: Figure 1 shows a front view of an accessory according to the present invention attached to a conventional brassiere; Figure 2 shows a plan view corresponding to Figure 1 ; Figure 3 shows the accessory of Figure 1 attached to a brassiere so as to correct/disguise a user's asymmetric breasts; Figure 4 shows a front view (as worn) of an accessory according to the present invention having different attachment means to that shown in Figure 1 ; Figure 5 shows an accessory according to the present invention where the tension means differs from that shown in Figure 1 , attached to a conventional brassiere; Figure 6 shows a plan view corresponding to Figure 5; Figure 7 shows an accessory similar to that of Figures 5 and 6, but asymmetrically attached to the brassiere cups so as to compensate for one breast of a user being smaller than the other; Figure 8 is a schematic illustration of an accessory in accordance with aspects of the present invention having an adjustable length; Figure 9 is a schematic illustration of an accessory in accordance with aspects of the present invention having spread fastener means; Figure 10 is a schematic illustration of an accessory arrangement in accordance with aspects of the present invention having two lateral elements and/or an upright accessory element; Figure 1 1 is a series of schematic illustrations a) to e) of respective accessory formats in accordance with aspects of the present invention with the accessory formed by two or more accessory elements or parts; Figure 12 provides schematic illustrations of an accessory in accordance with aspects of the present invention used with regard to trousers or jeans with gap on a wearer between portions of the garment either side of a zip or the like; and, Figure 13 provides schematic illustrations of an accessory in accordance with aspects of the present invention used with regard to a dress on a wearer with gap between portions of the garment either side of a zip or the like. Accessories in accordance with aspects of the present invention will be used mainly with brassieres and the like where a compressive confinement of a garment about a user's bust and particularly breasts can be used by a tension member passively or actively to control presentation of the breasts. Thus, the accessory might also be used across a gap in a blouse or dress or jeans or a coat or a top or a corset or other garments. The description and use of a brassiere is provided as an example of a suitable garment. Figures 1-3 show an accessory according to a first embodiment of aspects of the present invention. Figure 1 shows the accessory (10) attached to a conventional brassiere (B) that has a first cup (C1 ) or garment part, a second cup (C2) or garment part and a bridge portion (D) across a gap between the cups C1 , C2 that is permanently connected to the first and the second cups (conventional shoulder straps and/or around-the-back strap(s) are not shown). The bridge D tends to be towards the rear of the brassiere B and to the bottom side to provide support and location against a user's chest. The accessory (10) comprises: a first portion (12) or accessory element having attachment means (20) that allow releasable attachment to any user-selected or specified part of the first cup (C1) of the brassiere (B); a releasable second portion (14) or accessory element also has attachment means (22) that allow releasable attachment to any user-selected or specified part of a second cup (C2) of said brassiere B. The first and second portions (12, 14) are detachably connected by a releasable tension means or member (16) that in use can operably co-operate with the first and second portions (12, 14) to actively pull (by means of a tension force F) these portions (12, 14) and the connected cups (C1 and C2) directly towards each other. Alternatively the tension means or member may be a robust means to connect the portions or element 12, 14 together as an integral combination so that with a preset or individually set length the cups are passively brought towards each other in tension by the compressive confinement of the user's breasts in the brassiere. In use by appropriate positioning of the said first and second portions (12, 14) or attachment means (20, 22) on the first and second cups (C and C2) a wearer of the combined brassiere (B) and accessory (10) may adjust the shape of one or both of her breasts and/or their relative positions. It will also be understood that the releasable tension means in some embodiments may not provide active tension itself but rather be structurally robust or stable as described above so that the natural bias of compressive confinement of the breasts forced together will create tension in the tension means. In such circumstances the tension means may be a solid member with attachment means at ends of the member or a two or more parts or elements in combination with means to robustly secure the members or elements together in a fixed relationship or so that the members/elements may be adjusted together on a slide or ratchet to vary the length between the ends attached to the cups and so tension across those cups. The first portion (12) and the second portion (14) are individual items and the releasable tension means or member comprises means that allow these individual items to in use to be directly connected and disconnected to provide said tension force (F). In use, a wearer typically attaches the first portion (12) to a selected part of the garment first cup (C1) using the attachment means (20). In this embodiment the attachment means (20) comprise a pin (see item 24 of Figure 2) that in use fully penetrates the fabric of the first cup (C1 ). The wearer then typically attaches the second portion (14) to a selected part of the garment second cup (C2) using the attachment means (22). In this embodiment the attachment means (22) also comprises a pin (See item 26 of Figure 2) that in use fully penetrates the fabric of the first cup (C2). This type of attachment means is particularly suitable for use with brassieres and garments that are made of relatively thick material or are padded. However, it will be appreciate that some wearers may not wish to have a pin extending through towards their breast or where the brassiere may be damaged by such pins so alternative means of mostly flatly attaching the accessory are described later on. The wearer then connects the first and second portions (12, 14) together using the releasable tension means (16). Figure 1 illustrates releasable means (16) that comprise interlocking portions (30, 32); for example, the releasable tension means may comprise a hook (on the first portion) and an eye (on the second portion). The connection or joining acts as the tension member or means between the first and the second portions and so results in a tension force (F) that pulls the wearer's breasts closer together; thus increasing cleavage. Typically, the first and the second portions have ornamental/decorative front faces (not shown). This makes the accessory attractive and thereby advantageously allows it to be visibly worn. Alternatively, the accessory (10) may be worn under a garment such as a blouse or the top of a dress to be publically seen or not. When a user wishes to disguise or compensate for asymmetric breasts the user will typically attach the first and second portions asymmetrically to the first and second cups (C1 , C2). Figure 3 shows the accessory of the first embodiment so attached. In this case the first portion (12) is attached to a lower point on the first cup (C1 ) than the second portion (14) to the second cup (C2). This results in more support being provided to the first cup (C1 ) than to the second cup (C2). Such positioning helps disguise and compensate for asymmetric breasts as seen where the wearer's right hand breast (in use supported by the first cup C1 ) is slightly lower than her second breast. It will be appreciated switching positioning on the cups C1 , C2 will be provide compensation for asymmetric breasts where the left breast is slightly lower than the right breast or vice versa. Figure 4 shows a second embodiment of the invention where the accessory (10) again comprises first and second portions (12, 14); with a tension member or tension means (16) similar/equivalent or the same as described above; but where the attachment means (20) and (22) comprises a loop (42, 44) configured to releasably engage a separate and detachable profiled stud (46, 48). These loops (42, 44) are entirely detachable from the profiled studs (46, 48). This attachment means (20, 22) is described in more detail below (for a third embodiment). The first portion (12) and the second portion (14) are individual items and the releasable tension means or member comprises means that allows these individual items to in use be directly connected and disconnected to provide said tension force (F) drawing the cups or parts of a garment towards each other. Figure 5 shows a third embodiment of aspects of the invention where the accessory (10) again comprises a first portion (12) having attachment means that allow releasable attachment to any part (as selected by a user) of a first cup (C1 ) or garment part of said brassiere (B); a second portion (14) having attachment means that allow releasable attachment to any part (as selected by a user) of a second cup (C2) or garment part of said brassiere; and further comprising an extendable tension means (16) that in use operably co-operates with said first and second portions (12, 14) to provide a direct active tension force (F) acting along a straight line or substantially straight line between said first and second portions (12, .14); so that in use by appropriate positioning of the said first and second portions (12, 14) on the first and second cups (C1 and C2) a wearer of the combined brassiere (B) and accessory (10) may adjust the shape of one or both of her breasts and/or the relative positions of garment parts across a gap sustained by a wearer's breasts or other body part. In figure 5 the tension means (16) comprises a first elongate member (50) attached or readily attached/detached at or near a first end to the first portion (12) and a second elongate member (52) attached/attachable at or near to a first end to the second portion. In this case the required tension force (F) is applied by connecting the second end portions of the first and second elongate members (50, 52) to each other; either directly (for example by tying) or by means of a connector (56). When used such a connector may typically comprise a conventional garment strap connector. Preferably, the connector will (in use) allow the tensioned length of the elongate members (50, 52) to be adjusted and so the tension between the garment parts or cups allowing user defined alteration in gap configuration and breast or other body part shape. Each of the attachment means (see Figures 5 and 6) comprises: a loop member (42, 44) - in its simplest form a wire loop member (not illustrated), attached to or forming part of the first and second portions (12, 14) respectively; and (when not in use) a completely separate profiled (when viewed from side) stud member (46, 48) preferably with an integrally formed larger diameter base portion (54, 56). The user attaches the first and second portions (12, 14) to the brassiere cups by positioning the stud member (46 or 48) on the inside (as worn) of the brassiere cup (C1 or C2) and then using the loop member (42 or 44) to engage both the portion of the brassiere cup surrounding the top end of the stud and also the stud therein (see Figure 6). The base portions (54, 56) help prevent the attachment means (12, 14) damaging the brassiere material. This type of attachment means is particularly well suited for brassieres that are made of thin or lightweight fabric/material. The attachment means (12, 14) of the accessory (10) illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 6 are positioned symmetrically on the brassiere or garment cups (C1 , C2); used in this way the accessory (10) enhances breast cleavage when attached to the cups. Figure 7 shows an accessory (10) very similar to that illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 but in this instance the attachment means (12, 14) are positioned asymmetrically on the cups (C1 , C2) with the first attachment means (12) being positioned higher up and nearer the edge of the cup C1 than the second attachment means is positioned on the second cup (C2). When a user positions the attachment means in this manner it largely disguises one breast (in this example the breast supported by cup C1 ) of a user being somewhat larger than the other (supported by cup C2). It will be understood that aspects of the present invention relate to provision of an accessory for use with garments such as a brassiere or the like with a gap which can be drawn together to defined and position underlying breasts. As outlined above the accessory could be of a substantially fixed length when assembled from two or more parts fastened together or have an adjustment mechanism such as a slip ratchet or hook and fleece fastener or press studs. It could also be of variable length so accessories for current user requirements or tastes could also be achieved by providing accessories with accessory elements with common means for association into the accessory as required so there would be a set of elements which combination chosen by the user to create the as used accessory on the garment to achieve the desired tension. It will also be understood that being an accessory for a garment that appearance, individuality and aesthetic appeal will be important so providing sets of mutually compatible accessory elements for individual choice will be desirable. Figure 8 provides a schematic side illustration of one way to provide dynamic or active adjustment of an accessory 100 in accordance with aspects of the present invention. The accessory 100 for a garment comprises two tubes or one tube 101 and a solid core centre 102 in a concentric telescopic arrangement so allowing adjustment of length. This can be prior to attachment to the garment or whilst the accessory is being worn on a garment to allow active in-situ adjustment for personal requirements or comfort in different situations. Between the tubes 101 , 102 some form of means for relative movement and retention of position will be provided so there may be a screw thread or a friction association or ratchet or similar features at the interface 103 to hold position. With a brassiere it will be appreciated that the attachment means to secure the accessory to the cups ideally should not locally pull the material of the cups to create an unsightly distortion in the cup as seen. In such circumstance the attachment means will ideally act over an area of the cup rather than at a narrow point. This may be achieved with a hook and fleece pad attachment but this may limit the user to specified individual locations of the attachment means and ends upon the garment or cups. One approach as illustrated in figure 9 provides a narrow attachment means in the form of a pin 1 10 or similar robust fastener with a collar 1 1 1 possibly inside and/or outside of the cup or garment part to smooth and spread the tension load and so reduce localized distortion. Each attachment pin 1 0 will be provided at the ends of an accessory 1 12 which may have fixed length or be adjustable in length. In any event provision of load spreading pads or the like will assist with the pivot and swivel about the attachment as the garment parts or cups are brought together. Broad fasteners attached over a wide area will tend to rush and crimple the garment part when the actuator creates tension so narrow attachment may be advantageous to allow swivel but a collar pad will stop local pull distortion at the attachment site. Flat or close association of the attachment means with the garment is helpful to avoid unsightly crimping and rushing of the garment material as seen about the attachment site. It will be understood that generally a single accessory in accordance with aspects of the present invention will be provided between cups or garment parts. However, it will also be understood that two or more accessories between brassiere cups could be provided for purely aesthetic reasons but more importantly to provide more adjustment possibilities as required. In figure 10 an accessory 130 is illustrated between garment parts 131 , 132 in the form of brassiere cups. The accessory 130 as illustrated comprises two lateral accessory parts 130a, 130b and one upright part 30c which may be integrally formed or separate parts secured together as required. It will be understood that the lateral accessory parts 130a, 130b can be of different length, thickness/width and material response such as elasticity so that along with user specified fastening positions on the cups 131 , 132 individual presentation of the cups and so breasts can be achieved with more range and flexibility than with a single lateral accessory part or element as described previously. By providing two or more lateral accessory parts or elements it will be understood that this will allow an upright or vertical accessory part or element 130c to be secured to the lateral elements 130a, 130b. In addition to providing more capability for decoration it will also be understood that the part 130c will keep location between the lateral accessory parts 130a, 130b and alter the angle of attachment of the elements 130a, 130b to the cups 131 , 132. As indicated above accessories in accordance with aspects of the present invention will generally provide a tension in a line between points of attachment to the garment parts. However, it will be appreciated that the line of tension need not be provide by a linear or straight component or components so as illustrated in figure 1 1 a) to e) various alternative configurations are possible. In figure 1 1 a) a spiral or helix accessory 140 is provided between fastener ends 141 , 142. The spiral or helix will have a spring like action which will create the desired tension force as required. The length of action of the spiral or helix accessory can be limited by a range tether (shown in broken line) so that tension is created whilst also providing some suspension which may render the assembly more comfortable to wear. An over sleeve or tube may also be provided for range limitation and aesthetic reasons. In figure 1 b) a bent or bowed accessory 50 is illustrated formed of a suitable material to flex in use. The accessory can be bent upwards or downwards as desired such that in use the desired reaction can be achieved for flexing and comfort. In figure 1 1c) and figure 1 1 d) two accessory elements or parts 160a), 160b): 170a), 170b) are respectively provided which are secured or at least associated together to provide an accessory in accordance with aspects of the present invention. The parts 160a), 160b): 170a), 170b) are bent so allow easier flexing in use whilst a tension force is created as a means to bring garment parts, brassiere cups together along a line between the ends. The parts 160a), 160b) will flex outwardly about middle parts and this outward flexing may act to shift a decorative element suspended between which may twinkle in light or activate an LED light etc. The parts 170a), 170b) will tend to flex about the intermediate association of the parts 170a), 170b) so that end will separate or come together so again creating a tension force but with some suspension for softer action and so comfort. In either event the parts 160a), 160b): 70a), 70b) will provide ends which have a broader contact range of attachment to the garment part or brassiere cup so again more comfort potentially compared to a straight linear bar or block as an accessory. 5 As described above accessories in accordance with aspects of the present invention can be provided in a number of accessory configurations to achieve both a functional effect as well as aesthetic appeal. Thus, as illustrated in figure 11 e) a bow tie effect can be provided in an accessory 180 from two triangular or conical I 0 elements 180a, 180b with narrow ends overlapping to define in combination the accessory 180. The accessory 180 may also be presented as a diamond shape with the broad sides inward together and the narrow parts abutting or overlapping for functional and aesthetic effect. ] 5 Embodiments of aspects of the present invention have been described above mostly in relation to a brassiere but accessories in accordance with aspects of the present invention can also be used in relation to other garments particularly when user or wearer body parts are confined so tension can be generated by the accessory by being fixed and robust and/or by tension straps or elements built in to 20 the accessory itself. Figure 12 and figure 13 respectively illustrate accessories in accordance with aspects of the present invention used in relation to trousers or jeans in figure 12 and a dress in figure 13. The problems with some garments is that people come in a range of sizes but at least off the peg garments are standardized so that this and the inherent fluctuation that most people have with regard to weight 5 mean that garments which extend over confined parts of a wearer's body variously gape around zips and slits. Accessories in accordance with aspects of the present invention can accommodate such variations whilst maintaining comfort, security and providing additional aesthetic accoutrements in the vicinity. 0 In figure 12a) a pair of trousers or jeans 200 are shown with a zipper or fly 201 between parts or portions 202a, 202b of the jeans 200 which should come together when putting the jeans 200 on by a wearer. As discussed above either for comfort or because the standardized shaping is not that of the real wearer the portions 202a, 202b do not conveniently come together so there is a gap or possibly an overlap. An accessory 203 in accordance with aspects of the present invention can then extend between the portions 202a, 202b to effectively fill in and retain the portions 202a, 202b together as desired by a wearer. As described previously the accessory 203 can be decorative as well as functional in providing tension between the portions for security of the garment in the form of trousers or jeans about the person as desired by the user. Figure 13 describes a dress 300 having a back seam or closure 301 which includes a zip or buttons so that the dress can be worn by a user. It will also be understood that the seam or closure could also be a slit or opening extending up from the cleavage of a user with or without a zip or buttons or the like. In any event due to user shape the closure 301 has opposed garment portions 302a, 302b which either have a gap or overlap when a wearer wears the dress 300. In accordance with aspects of the present invention an accessory 303 extends between the portions 302a, 302b to retain the portions in tension due to underlying confinement of the user's body parts so that greater comfort and security is provided plus an opportunity for decorative embellishment. As will be appreciated accessories in accordance with aspects of the present invention will generally be provided in the form of a kit of parts with assemblies or combinations of parts variously made for user/wearer preferences in terms of comfort, development of cleavage, adjustment and positioning about the breasts or user's body and aesthetics. In such circumstances a base or initial kit may be provided with a number of parts and then through mutual compatibility further parts or kits purchased or acquired can be used to build a repertoire of accessories which can be for a number of occasions and with different colours or style of garments. It will also be understood by providing a kit of matching parts that the user or wearer can change the size and configuration of the accessory as their body shape changes will weight loss or gain and social activity. The parts of the accessory typically may be connected by hook and loop associations or directly lock with each other on a temporary basis. However, it will also be understood that semi-permanent and permanent accessories may be made by the user or wearer by the connections being such that once formed they are permanent so that accessory kit in such circumstances becomes more of a craft or hobbyist type arrangement in which the parts are acquired so that individualized accessory items are provided for aesthetic appeal but with the underlying tension functions of the present invention to present breast and other body parts under a garment such as a brassiere. Accessories can be made of a range of materials including plastics materials, metals, wood and similar as well as expensive jewelry materials and combinations thereof. It will be appreciated interchangeability of components may be desirable to allow individual accessories to be created by a user or bespoke constructions created by a craftsman or jeweler for an individual. The attachment means needs to be attractive and mostly non-intrusive so generally smooth or flat against the garment or wearer's body part. A number of attachment means are possible in combinations or alone so clips, pins, hook and fleece and similar attachment regimes may be used. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any number of combinations of the aforementioned features and/or those shown in the appended drawings provide clear advantages over the prior art and are therefore within the scope of the invention described herein. (1) An accessory (10) for a brassiere or garment, the accessory comprising: a first portion (12) having attachment means to allow releasable attachment to any user- selected part of a garment on one side of a gap; a second portion (14) having attachment means that allow releasable attachment to any part of the garment on the other side of the gap; and further comprising a releasable tension member of selected length which operates between said first and second portions (12, 14) to hold or to pull the portions and the connected parts of the garment either side of the gap directly towards each other; the attachment means being configured for engagement against and upon a respective surface area part of the garment for flat close presentation of the said first and second portions (12, 14) on the garment so the gap is adjusted in a line there between the first and second portions. (2) An. accessory as claimed in claim 1 wherein the tension member is extendable and/or contractible to provide a direct tension force (F) acting along a line or substantially straight line between said first and second portions (12, 14) or attachment means (20, 22); so that in use by appropriate positioning of the said first and second portions ( 2, 4) on the garment a wearer may adjust the shape of one or both of her breasts and/or their relative positions and/or a garment. (3) An accessory (10) according to Claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the first portion (12) attachment means or second portion (14) attachment means comprises a pin that in use fully penetrates the fabric of the garment. (4) An accessory (10) according to any of Claims 1 , 2 or 3 wherein the first portion and the second portion are individual elements. (5) An accessory (10) according to Claim 4 where the releasable tension member (16) comprises means that allow said individual elements to in use be directly connected and disconnected to provide said tension force (F). (6) An accessory (10) according to Claim 4 or claim 5 wherein the individual items are (in use) connected side-by-side or in line with each other. (7) An accessory (10) according to any preceding claim wherein the first portion (12) attachment means and/or the second portion (14) attachment means comprise a loop fastener that in use engages a separate stud such that the fabric of at least one part of the garment is held between the separate stud and the loop. (8) An accessory (10) according to any of Claims 4 to 7 wherein the first and/or second portion have decorative item(s) to act collectively with the other portion. 9.

An accessory substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings. 1 1. A method of compensating for asymmetric breast shapes using an accessory according to any preceding claim comprising the steps of: (a) Attaching separately said first and second portions (12, 14) to first and second parts of the garment such as a brassiere for location about a user's breasts using said attachment means (20, 22); (b) Applying a direct tension (F) between first and second portions or attachment means (20, 22) using said tension member (16) against compressive resistance within the garment provided by confinement such as in use of a user's breasts within the brassiere or a user's body parts in a garment; (c) Positioning said attachment means asymmetrically on adjacent parts of the brassiere across the gap such that extra support is provided to a first side to the brassiere for a first breast across the gap than to a second part of the brassiere for a second breast on the opposite side of the gap, thereby compensating for asymmetry between the first breast and the second breast. 12. A method of compensating for uneven sized breasts using an accessory (10) according to any of Claims 1 to 9 comprising the steps of: (a) Attaching separated said first and second portions (12, 14) to first and second cups of a brassiere or garment using said attachment means (20, 22); (b) Applying a direct tension (F) between first and second portions or attachment means (20, 22) using said tension means (16); (c) Positioning said attachment means asymmetrically (on adjacent cups) such that less support is provided to a first cup supporting a larger breast in use than to a second cup supporting a smaller breast in use relative to the larger breast by: positioning second attachment means lower down the second cup C2 and further from the centre of the brassiere than said first attachment means on the first cup C1 ; and thereby compensating for a wearer's uneven sized breasts sizes.
