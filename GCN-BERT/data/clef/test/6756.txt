Step 4
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-hydroxy-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1,2, 3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
3-(2-(isobutylamino)propyl)-2-methylphenol 92c (3.7 g, 0.017 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL of methanol, then (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl)acrylate 1e (5.68 g, 0.025 mol) and acetic acid (2.04 g, 0.03 mmol) were added. The reaction solution was warmed up to 60Â°C and stirred for 12 hours, then cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-hydroxy-2-isobutyl-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroi soquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 92d (2.5g, yield 34%) as a yellow oil.
