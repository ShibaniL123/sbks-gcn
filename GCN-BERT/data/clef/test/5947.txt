This application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/656,322 filed Jan. 22, 2007, which is a Divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/311,666 filed Dec. 17, 2002 which claims the befit of International Application No. PCT/RU2001/000239, filed Jun. 19, 2001, all of which are hereby incorporate herein by reference in their entireties. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to medicine and can be employed for treating various diseases and for producing pharmaceutical preparations possessing no side effects. DESCRIPTION OF THE BACKGROUND ART The use of antibodies for treating pathological syndromes is well known (SU 1331508 A, A 61 K 39/00, 1984; SU 1730144 A1, C 12 N 7/00, 1992). Also known are pharmaceutical preparations based on antibodies (serums, immunoglobulins) applied in therapeutic doses. (see, for example, Register of Pharmaceutical Agents of Russia, Encyclopedia of Drugs, 7th edition, 2000, pp. 358-359). However, the range of application of these preparations is for the most part limited to etiological treatment of infectious diseases, and their use may be associated with undesirable side effects. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention is aimed at enhancing the efficacy of treatment of pathological syndromes by the use of antibodies in activated forms for fundamentally new indications—to control a pathological syndrome; it is also intended for producing pharmaceutical substances without marked side effects. For solution of the given problem, the method for treating a pathological syndrome includes administration of activated forms of ultra-low doses of antibodies to an antigen, wherein said activated forms are obtained by repeated consecutive dilution combined with external treatment, and said antigen is a substance or a pharmaceutical agent implicated in or exerting influence upon the mechanisms of formation of the pathological syndrome; said antigen can also represent a substance (or drug) that is, upon its introduction into the body, with non-medical purposes included, can act as direct cause of the pathological syndrome. To this end it is expedient to use ultra-low doses of antibodies in activated forms prepared by homeopathic technology of potentiation (dynamization). Activated forms of ultra-low doses of antibodies to a substance or a pharmaceutical agent can be also introduced together with this very substance or pharmaceutical agent implicated in or exerting influence upon the mechanisms of the pathological syndrome or directly causing the pathological syndrome. Besides, the objective is also accomplished by a pharmaceutical agent containing activated forms of ultra-low doses of monoclonal, polyclonal or natural antibodies to an antigen, wherein said activated forms are produced by repeated consecutive dilution and external treatment predominantly based on homeopathic technology, and said antigen is a substance or a pharmaceutical agent exerting influence upon regulation of the impaired function. At that, antibodies used in activated (potentiated) forms of ultra-low doses are raised against antigens of exogenous or endogenous origin, against autologous antigens, fetal antigens; anti-idiotypic antibodies are used too. The drugs (pharmaceutical agents) obtained in accordance with the present invention constitute a novel class of pharmacological preparations, distinctive in combination of specific pharmacological activity, stable therapeutic action free from side effects, ecological purity and low prime cost. EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The pharmaceutical preparation can be prepared in the following way. 1. Obtaining of Antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies specifically binding to compounds of various classes: proteins, polynucleotides, oligosaccharides, glycolipids, etc. and interacting with low-molecular substances (haptens) are obtained through active immunization of animals. For this purpose, animals are given a series of antigen injections according to a specially designed pattern, the antigen being either an individually isolated high-molecular substance, or a synthetic conjugate (for haptens). This procedure results in obtaining a monospecific antiserum with high content of antibodies apt for further processing. If necessary the antibodies present in the antiserum are purified. Fractionating by salt precipitation or ion exchange chromatography is used for this purpose. Monoclonal antibodies of different specificity interacting both with low-molecular haptens and with epitopes of high-molecular substances are obtained by means of hybridome technology. At that, the initial stage of the process includes immunization based on the principles already developed for preparation of polyclonal antiserums. Further stages of work envisage yielding antibody-producing clones of hybrid cells, produced antibodies being of identical specificity. Their isolation is carried out with the same methods as for polyclonal antiserums. Natural antibodies to exogenous antigens and biological regulators of various origins are isolated from human blood serum by the method of affinity chromatography. To this end, a carrier with a covalently bound antigen, either a hapten or a high-molecular compound is used as an immunosorbent. Chromatography yields antibodies with narrow specificity and affinity. Methods of obtaining antibodies are described, for example, in Immunological Methods, under the editorship of G. Frimel, Moscow, Medicina Publishing House, 1987, p. 9-33). Isolated antibodies to a substance or a pharmaceutical agent are consecutively repeatedly diluted and exposed to external treatment until ultra-low or low doses are obtained, for example, in accordance with homeopathic technology of potentiation (dynamization) (see V. Shvabe, Homeopathic Pharmaceutical Agents. A Manual on Description and Preparation, Moscow, 1967, p. 12-38). At that, the concentration is proportionally reduced through consecutive dilution of 1 volumetric part of the initial substance (antibodies) in 9 volumetric parts (for decimal dilutions, D) or in 99 volumetric parts (for centesimal dilutions, C) of a neutral solvent until the required dose (potency) is obtained; each dilution is followed by multiple vertical mechanical shaking; for each dilution separate vessel is preferable. External treatment in the process of dilution can also be performed by sound generator or other mechanical or electromagnetic action. The pharmaceutical preparation thus yielded is used for the most part in dosage forms and dilutions common for homeopathic practice, such as alcoholic or aqueous solutions or tablets (granules) obtained by saturating the excipient of the formulation with potentiated solution or by direct introduction of the latter into liquid dosage form of the preparation. An example of obtaining a pharmaceutical preparation in form of activated polyclonal antibodies (antiserum) to morphine is given below. 1. Obtaining Morphine-Ovalbumin Conjugate. Solution of 50 mg (0.001 mmol) ovalbumin in 5.0 ml of distilled water was mixed with 2.0 ml dimethylformamide containing 15.0 mg (0.039 mmol) of morphine 6-hemisuccinate and while the mixture was cooling the solution of 15 mg (0.055 mmol) of water-soluble carbodiimide in 3 ml of distilled water was added to it by drops. The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 hours at 4° C. The yielded conjugate was isolated by gel chromatography on Sephadex G25 column and exposed to lyophilization. The quantity of conjugated morphine was calculated from UV-spectra of the original protein and the yielded conjugate by changes in absorption at 280 nm. According to UV-spectra, the synthesized conjugate contained 12-15 moles of hapten per mole of protein. 2. Obtaining a Monospecific Antiserum to Morphine-Ovalbumin Conjugate Immunization of Viennese Blue rabbits weighing not more than 2 kg was performed in cycles with a 10-day interval between them. The maximal number of injections was four. The conjugate was injected into the area of periarticular lymph nodes of front and hind paws in the dose of 1 mg per immunization. To this end the antigen was previously diluted in 1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant. The total volume of immunization mixture was 2 ml. Subsequent immunizations were performed using incomplete Freund's adjuvant, adhering to the above-mentioned proportions of antigen and adjuvant. A test blood sample was drawn from marginal ear vein of the animal 10 days after immunization. The rabbit blood serum was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 minutes at room temperature; after that chloroform was added as a preservative its final concentration reaching 13%. The antiserum obtained was tested for specific antibodies to morphine by means of enzyme immunoassay, the antibodies being detected with conjugate of enzyme-labeled anti-species (anti-rabbit) antibodies. The obtained antiserum contained specific antibodies active in the dilution 1:1000-1:25000. Further on, γ-globulin fraction was isolated from the yielded antiserum To this end the protein was precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate with subsequent rinsing of the precipitate with 30% saline solution, centrifugation and dialysis against phosphate buffer. The fraction thus prepared contained specific antibodies to morphine and was then used for producing the pharmaceutical preparation. 3. Obtaining the Activated Form (Ultra-Low Dose) of the Antibodies to Morphine. Antiserum γ-globulins (0.5 ml) was placed into E-61 vessel and mixed with 4.5 ml of distilled water; the mixture was shaken 10 times yielding 5 ml of the first centesimal dilution. The first centesimal dilution (0.05 ml) was placed into E-62 vessel with 4.95 ml of distilled water; the mixture was shaken 10 times yielding 5 ml of the second centesimal dilution. The centesimal dilutions from the third to the twenty-ninth were prepared in a similar fashion. The thirtieth centesimal dilution was prepared by solving the twenty ninth one in 20% solution of ethanol. The yielded alcoholic solution was used for treatment purposes. Examples of use of activated forms of ultra-low doses of antibodies conventionally designated as potentiated (dynamized) antibodies (by analogy with terminology used in homeopathic literature) for treatment of various pathological syndromes are given below. EXAMPLE 1 Potentiated Antibodies to Hypnotic Medications A. Patient I., aged 46, a high school instructor, had long been suffering from insomnia manifested by difficulties in falling asleep. The patient had a history of hepatitis (hepatitis and impaired metabolism of xenobiotics in the liver resulting from it probably accounted for the aftereffects of the preparation). For the last six months the patient had been taking 7.5 mg of IMOVAN at bedtime 2-3 times a week; in the morning he suffered from drowsiness and dizziness. The dose reduced to ½ tablet did not produce the desirable somniferous effect. The treatment with antibodies to IMOVAN C200 in tablets was started after discontinuation of IMOVAN intake. Two weeks later dizziness and morning drowsiness disappeared. The patient's sleep became normal. B. Patient P., aged 62, complained of a sleeping disorder: awakening at 2-3 a.m. The patient had been using barbiturate derivatives as somniferous medications but abandoned these drugs because of their decreasing efficiency. The patient was recommended to take 10 drops of a 25% alcohol solution of potentiated monospecific antiserum to MIDAZOLAM (dormicum, flormidal, 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine hydrochloride) at bedtime. Three days after the beginning of the treatment the patient stated that he was easier falling asleep; the sleep duration extended to 7. A continued intake of the preparation was recommended. C. Patient Ch., aged 42, was admitted to hospital in the condition of moderate alcohol intoxication. Next morning the patient complained of tremor and disorders in coordination of movements. After a single dose of 15 ml of an aqueous solution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to NITRAZEPAM (radedorm, 1,3-dihydro-7-nitro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one) C30 the patient fell asleep. This suggested a conclusion that the preparation was efficient in restoration of sleep in the process of arresting alcohol abstinence syndrome. D. Patient R., aged 48, a-driver by profession, presented complaints of sleeping disorders due to overfatigue. An intranasal administration of 0.5 ml of a potentiated aqueous solution C20 of antibodies to ZOLPIDEM (N,N,6-trimethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)imidazolo[1,2-a]pyridine acetamide) at bedtime was suggested for controlling his insomnia: At a new visit 5 days later the patient stated normalization of his sleep. Examination did not reveal any depression of reflexes or muscle tone. This suggested a conclusion that this preparation can be prescribed to the patients whose professional activities require precise coordination of movements. E. Patient M., aged 54, complained of drowsiness and disorders in coordination of movements and presented a long-time history of the use of somniferous medications. After a 7-day course of treatment with potentiated solution of monoclonal antibodies to ZOPICLON (imovan) (6-(5-chloro-2-pyridinyl)-6,7-dihydro-7-oxo-5H-pyrrolo-[3,4-b]-pyrazine-5-ylic ester of 4-methyl-1-piperazine carboxylic acid) C50 in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day the enhancement of motor activity and sleep normalization were observed. EXAMPLE 2 Potentiated Antibodies to Anesthetic Drugs A. Patient M., aged 36, complained of nausea after the operation (appendectomy). For anesthesia THIOPENTAL SODIUM (monosodium salt of 5-ethyldihydro-5-(1-methylbutyl)-2-thiooxo-4,6-(1H,5H)-pyrimidinedione) had been used. An oral intake of 20 ml of a C30 homeopathic dilution of the antiserum to thiopental 3 times a day was prescribed, which made it possible to attenuate nausea. B. Patient P., aged 28, complained of cramps in his lower extremities and hypertonicity of the gastrocnemius muscles. An oral intake of 15 ml of a C200 dilution of potentiated antiserum to SODIUM OXYBUTIRATE (sodium salt of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) at bedtime was prescribed. The examination conducted 5 days later showed diminution of muscular tonicity. C. Patient M., aged 6, was admitted to the otorhinolaryngologic unit for a postoperative check-up after tonsillectomy. An oral administration of a C30 solution of potentiated antibodies to KETAMINE [+−2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone hydrochloride] made it possible to reduce the sensitivity of the child's mucosa and to perform an examination. D. Patient A., aged 47, complained of hiccup and tachycardia after administration of ETHOMIDATE (ethyl ester of (R)-1-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-imidazole-5-carboxylic acid). A single oral dose of 50 ml of a homeopathic C30 solution of monoclonal antibodies to ethomidate was administered. Thirty minutes later hiccup disappeared and the cardiac rhythm was back to normal. E. Patient D., aged 68, was admitted to a surgical hospital for a scheduled operation on benign prostatic hyperplasia. Three years earlier he had undergone an operation for urolithiasis under HALOTHANE (1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloro-2-bromoethane) anesthesia. The postoperative period was complicated by liver function disorders manifested by dyspepsia, hyperbilirubinemia, and positive liver function tests. The patient presented a history of poor tolerance of other anesthetics. Therefore, slow intravenous infusion of 3 ml of potentiated antibodies to HALOTHANE dissolved in a 5% glucose solution was used for anesthetic purposes. The operation and the postoperative period showed no complications. EXAMPLE 3 Potentiated Antibodies to Anticonvulsant Drugs A. Patient B., aged 19, has been suffering from generalized epilepsy (grand mal seizures combined with psychomotor symptoms) since the age of 5. TEGRETOL (5-carbamoyl-5H-dibenz(b,f)azepine) chosen by the trial-and-error method had proved to be the most efficient anticonvulsant drug for the patient; she had been receiving a dose of 0.2 mg (1 tablet) 3 times a day for 2-years. The patient's mother consulted the attending doctor at to multiple bruises having appeared on the patient's body in the course of the last 10 days without any preceding mechanical trauma. Total blood test revealed a depressed white blood (2.9×103/μl) and platelet count (100×103/μl). The treatment with C30 potentiated monoclonal antibodies to the dibenzoazepine group forming the basis of the drug molecule was started whereas TEGRETOL was discontinued. Two weeks later the blood pattern was back to normal, no epileptic seizures were registered. EXAMPLE 4 Potentiated Antibodies to Antiparkinsonian Drugs A. Patient Z., aged 37, developed parkinsonian symptoms after vernal encephalitis. The patient had been taking daily 10 mg (4 tablets) of BROMOKRYPTINE (2-bromo-α-ergokryptine) with good effect but complained of excessive fatigue, headaches, and constipation. The treatment with potentiated antibodies to 2-bromo-α-ergokryptine (a C1000 dilution) in a daily dose of 1 tablet taken in the morning was started. Three weeks later the bowel function was back to normal and headaches subsided; however, complaints of excessive fatigue persisted. B. Patient E., aged 72, was on LEVODOPA (3-hydroxy-1-tyrosine) for Parkinson's disease. He complained of nausea and vomiting. Antiemetic drugs of the phenothiazine group with smaller doses of LEVODOPA lead to the exacerbation of his main disease. The use of a C200 dilution of polyclonal potentiated antibodies to LEVODOPA in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day improved the patient's tolerance to the preparation. EXAMPLE 5 Potentiated Antibodies to Neuroleptics A. Patient E., aged 42, was admitted to a psycho-neurological dispensary in a condition of psychomotor agitation due to alcohol intoxication. Fifteen minutes after intravenous administration of 1 ml of a C30 aqueous solution of potentiated antiserum to HALOPERIDOL (4-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-1-piperidinyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-butanone decanoate) in a 5% glucose solution the agitation arrested and the patient went to sleep. B. Patient L., aged 50, consulted her physician for disordered coordination of movements. The examination revealed inhibited reflexes in her low extremities, namely the knee-jerk and the Achilles tendon reflexes. She presented a long-time (1.5 months) history of FLUPHENAZINE (moditene) intake. The discontinued use of the preparation was combined with an intranasal administration of a C30 aqueous solution of monoclonal antibodies to fluphenazine (4-[3-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-10H-phenothiazine-10-yl]propyl]-1-piperazinylethanol) and a once-a-day slow intravenous administration of a dose of 1 ml. Four days later the patient's gait was back to normal and the muscle tone of her low extremities increased. C. Patient R., aged 62, complained of restlessness and groundless night fears. Earlier she sought for physician's advice for insomnia and used to take radedorm for it. Oral administration at bedtime of the antiserum to AZALEPTINE (clozapine, leponex) (8-chloro-11-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-5H-dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepine) in a form of 10 ml of a C200 homeopathic solution was prescribed. Seven days later phobias disappeared and the sleep became normal. D. Patient Ch., aged 45, complained of tremor and disordered coordination of movements. He had a long-time history of neuroleptic drugs intake (haloperidol, aminazine) for schizophrenia. Oral administration of 5 ml of a C30 dilution of homeopathic solution of monoclonal antibodies to RISPERIDONE (3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)piperidino]ethyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one) twice a day by intramuscular injections was prescribed. Repeated examination 7 days later revealed absence of tremor and a tendency to normalization of the patient's gait. No psychotic disorders were observed. E. Patient S., aged 29, suffered from depressive-paranoid form of schizophrenia. He had been taking neuroleptic drugs of the phenothiazine series for some years; the best clinical effect was noted with TISERCINE (2-methoxy-10-(3-dimethylamino-2-methylpropyl)-phenothiazine hydrochloride). During last 4 months the patient himself and his relatives drew their attention to the aggravation of extrapyramidal disorders and impaired bowel function (constipation). Total blood rest revealed depressed white blood count reaching the lower bound of normal (3.8×103/μl). The use of a C1000 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to PHENOTHIAZINE in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day for 20 days (with discontinued tisercine intake) resulted in a marked relaxation of extrapyramidal disorders and normalization of the bowel function; the patient's white blood count increased to 4.7×103/μl. No psychotic disorders were present. The patient's sleep, appetite and mood were within normal limits. F. Patient F., aged 19, suffered from oligophrenia in the form of idiocy; aggressive behavior. She received a maintaining dose of HALOPERIDOL (4-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-1-piperidinyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-butanone decanoate) (20 mg daily) and displayed marked extrapyramidal disorders. The lowering of the dose resulted in the enhancement of the patient's aggressiveness. The use of a C30 dilution of polyclonal potentiated antibodies to butyrophenone in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day improved the tolerance of HALOPERIDOL and made it possible to reduce the dose to 5 mg a day and subsequently to maintain the patient in a satisfactory condition by administering the potentiated preparation alone. EXAMPLE 6 Potentiated Antibodies to Minor Tranquilizers A. Patient V., aged 50, a research worker, has been receiving a daytime tranquilizer, MEZAPAM, for his obsessive-compulsive neurosis. He complained of drowsiness (probably caused by impaired detoxifying function of his liver). The use of a C30 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to the benzodiazepine nucleus made it possible to replace the tranquilizer. The patient's condition became satisfactory; no neurotic disorders were noted. B. Patient E., aged 71, complained of restlessness and insomnia. Oral administration of a C200 preparation of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to DIAZEPAM (7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one) in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was prescribed. Four days later the district physician noted normalization of sleep along with fewer complaints of restlessness. C. Patient S., aged 30, registered in a psycho-neurological dispensary, complained of the onset of restlessness, anxiety, and insomnia after the withdrawal of PHENAZEPAM. Oral intake of the homeopathic solution of antiserum to 2H-1,4-benzodiazepine twice a day was prescribed. After two days of treatment the normalization of sleep and mood were noticed. The general state of health was satisfactory and no anxiety was observed. D. Patient I., aged 39, complained of fatigability, disorders in coordination of movements, and restlessness. Examination revealed no organic disorders of the central nervous system. After the diagnosis of neurasthenia was established a course of treatment with a C12 homeopathic solution of polyclonal anti-bodies to PHENIBUT (γ-amino-β-phenylbutyric acid hydrochloride) was suggested. After 2 days of oral intake (1 tablet twice a day) of the preparation tremor subsided and sleep became normal. EXAMPLE 7 Potentiated Antibodies to Antidepressants A. Patient V., aged 36, complained of the worsening of mood and sleeping disorders in form of early awakening along with difficulties in falling asleep. The patient also stated irritability and tremor without objective reason. An intranasal administration of 5 drops of a C30 homeopathic solution of antiserum to FLUOXETIN (PROZAC) (+−)-N-methyl-γ-[4-(trifluormethyl)phenoxy]benzolpropanamine) 3 times a day was recommended. Upon a new examination 5 days later the patient stated the betterment of his mood along with a tendency to normalization of sleep. The physician's recommendation was to continue the course of treatment. B. Patient K., aged 39, complained of insomnia, tremor, restlessness, and impaired ability to work. He received a course of treatment with a C1000 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to FLUVOXAMINE ((E)-5-methoxy-1-[4-(trifluormethyl)phenyl]-1-pentanone-O-(2-aminoethyl)oxime) in an oral dose of 1 tablet 4 times a day. After 3 days of regular drug intake the normalization of sleep was observed along with the improvement of mood and control of restlessness. C. Patient Sh., aged 56, complained of restlessness, feeling of fear, and sleep disorders. An intranasal administration of 1 ml of a 2% C30 solution of antiserum to AMITRIPTYLINE (3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[a,d]-cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N,N-di-methyl-1-propanamine) 3 times a day was recommended. Upon a new examination 3 days later the patient stated the normalization of sleep along with the reduction in the frequency and intensity of his fits of phobia. He was advised to continue this treatment; high efficacy of the drug in this particular case was noted. D. A young man aged 18 had been suffering from enuresis since his childhood. AMITRIPTYLINE was found to have a good effect upon him. After three weeks of treatment the patient's relatives noticed his drowsiness; the patient himself complained of visual disorders (impaired accommodation) and bouts of arrhythmia from time to time. A C50 dilution of potentiated monoclonal anti-bodies to the tricyclic group, constituting the nucleus of tricyclic antidepressants was prescribed in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day. The symptoms of side effects disappeared whereas the curative action persisted. E. Patient Ch., aged 32, a manager, presented a vast number of complaints among which the dominating were constant tiredness, poor sleep with no refreshing effect, reduced ability to work, depression, constipation along with joint and muscle aches. This condition had been lasting for more than half a year. A thorough clinical and laboratory examination revealed no psycho-neurological or somatic lesions that would account for such syndromes. The diagnosis of a chronic fatigue syndrome was established. A month of combined therapy including physiotherapy, vitamin therapy, and antidepressant IMIPRAMINE intake resulted in a mild positive effect. The treatment with a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to IMIPRAMINE in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was begun. A week later a marked improvement in the patient's condition was noted; his ability to work increased and the number of complaints declined. F. Patient K., aged 29, was admitted to a psycho-neurological hospital with an established diagnosis of manic-depressive psychosis in the phase of exacerbation. During examination the patient complained of the lack of motivations and tearfulness; the patient was not active physically. He used to take amitriptyline and diazepam for a long time. An oral intake of a C1000 solution of the antiserum to MOCLOBEMIDE (aurorix) (p-chloro-N-(2-morpholinoethyl)-benzamide) in the form of 5 ml of the aqueous solution 2 times a day was prescribed. A new examination 4 days later showed that the patient became more compliant; improved mood and enhanced liveliness were reported. A conclusion was drawn that the therapy was efficient. G. Patient C., aged 49, suffered from depression and sociophobia; he had been receiving daily 225 mg of MOCLOBEMIDE (aurorix) (1.5 tablets in three doses). Despite his attending-physician's warnings the patient sometimes broke his diet. Twice after eating a cheese sandwich and a pizza with cheese he had episodes of hypertension, his blood pressure reaching 190/110 mm Hg. With moclobemide discontinued, a C30 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to moclobemide was administered in a dose of 1 tablet once a day. Further on, the treatment was well tolerated and depression symptoms subsided rapidly. H. Patient S., aged 44, developed fluctuations of mood, tearfulness, and low vital activity caused by the climacteric period. Her psychiatrist estimated these symptoms as manifestations of a depressive syndrome. The use of traditional antidepressants caused somnolence and lethargy interfering with her professional duties. The prescription of a C12 dilution of potentiated antiserum to CERTRALINE purified by affinity chromatography in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day resulted in a rapid improvement of the patient's general state and stabilization of her mood. EXAMPLE 8 Potentiated Antibodies to Antiemetic Drugs of Central Action A. Patient Zh., aged 64, developed nausea and vomiting during the course of radio- and chemotherapy for peripheral lung cancer. The prescription of MOTILIUM controlled manifestations of dyspepsia but caused weakness, somnolence and intestinal cramps. With MOTILIUM discontinued, the administration of 1 ml of a C6 dilution of potentiated antibodies to MOTILIUM in the form of intramuscular injections twice a day resulted in the disappearance of neurotoxic and spastic reactions. The use of the preparation was continued with a positive clinical effect. EXAMPLE 9 Potentiated Antibodies to Central-Action Muscle Relaxants A. Patient B., aged 25, developed contractures of his lower extremities after a spinal trauma. MYDOCALM (1-piperidino-2-methyl-3-para-tolylpropanone-3 hydrochloride) in a dose of 300 mg a day was prescribed. After a favorable initial effect the patient noticed a gradual increase in the muscular tension in his lower extremities along with systemic arterial hypotension (105/60 mm Hg) after 2 months of the treatment. The prescription of a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to MYDOCALM in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day resulted in the normalization of arterial blood pressure (120/70) as well as in the reduction of muscular tension. The antibody therapy made it possible to reduce the dose of MYDOCALM by 25%. EXAMPLE 10 Potentiated Antibodies to Choline Esterase Inhibitors A. Patient P., aged 20, with an established diagnosis of congenital myasthenia took UBRETIDE (3-oxy-1-methylpyridinium-hexamethylene-bis-(N-methylcarbamate) dibromide) (the maintaining dose was 1 tablet every other day). She started complaining of excessive salivation and abdominal cramps. The use of a D6 dilution of potentiated antibodies to UBRETIDE in a daily morning dose of 1 tablet improved the patient's tolerance of UBRETIDE without reducing its efficacy and later made it possible to switch to therapy with the potentiated preparation only. EXAMPLE 11 Potentiated Antibodies to Psychostimulants and Nootropic Drugs A. Patient M., aged 58, complained of memory disorders and insomnia. An oral intake of 20 drops of an alcohol solution of antibodies to NOOTROPIL (pyracetam) (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinylacetamide) in a potency of C200 at bedtime was prescribed. During her second visit 7 days later the patient reported of an extended duration of sleep along with less difficulties in falling asleep. The recommendation was to continue the course of treatment. B. Patient M., aged 43, was admitted to hospital in the state of alcohol withdrawal. The next day he started complaining of restlessness and tremor. A C30 dilution of potentiated antiserum to AMINALON (gammalon) (4-aminobutyric acid) in a dose of 1 tablet 6 times a day was prescribed. The reduction of tremor and the improvement of mood were noted. After 2 days of therapy the patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition. C. Patient S., aged 72, complained of tachycardia and sleeping disorders; she presented a long-time (3 weeks) history of SYDNOCARB (3-(α-methylphenyl)-N-phenyl-carbamoylsydnonimine) intake. The intranasal administration of 10 drops of a C15 solution of monoclonal antibodies to SYDNOCARB 3 times a day was prescribed. An examination after 5 days of treatment revealed the absence of tachycardia; the patient reported of less difficulties in falling asleep. D. Patient V., aged 65, with an established diagnosis of asthenic syndrome as a remote consequence of a cranio-cerebral trauma had been taking MOLSIDOMINE (ethyl ester of N-carboxy-3-morpholino-sydnonimine) in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day (6 mg per diem) to prevent fits. She sought her physician's advice for headaches and worsening of sleep. After MOLSIDOMINE withdrawal the treatment with C30 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to the sydnonimine group in a dose of 1 tablet in the morning was started. The favorable effect of the treatment has been lasting for 6 months. E. Patient D., aged 38, complained of fatigability, weakness, and headaches. The oral intake of 10 ml of a C40 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to CAFFEINE (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) 3 times a day was prescribed. At his second visit to the physician 7 days later the patient pointed to easier awakening and the disappearance of headaches. He was recommended to continue the course of treatment. F. Patient P., aged 35, a journalist by profession, presented symptoms of caffeine addiction: he had to drink up to 12-15 cups of strong coffee to keep himself active. The patient was emotionally labile, inclined to overestimating his own personality, and complained of poor sleep. He also had a pronounced tremor of his hands. The use of a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to CAFFEINE (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day resulted in the reduction of the amount of consumed coffee to 4-5 cups, the improvement of sleep, the disappearance of tremor, and better mood. Now the patient is active and manifests high working efficiency. G. Patient R., aged 78, is on regular treatment with PYRACETAM (nootropil) (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinylacetamide) in a daily dose of 1.6 g for Alzheimer's disease. The general effect of the treatment being favorable, the patient's relatives noticed enhancement of the patient's sexual activity manifested by his inappropriate behavior. The substitution of pyracetam by a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to PYRACETAM made it possible to get rid of sexual disinhibition while preserving the nootropic effect. H. Patient G., aged 4, suffered from mental retardation due to a birth trauma. A 4-week course of everyday injections of CEREBROLYSINE (a complex of peptides isolated from pig brain) resulted in some improvement of the child's cognitive activity. During repeated courses of treatment cerebrolysin was substituted by a C50 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to it (in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day). The patient's memory became much better as well as her abilities to develop and maintain skills. EXAMPLE 12 Potentiated Antibodies to Preparations Improving Cerebral Circulation A.

Within the framework of combined therapy he was receiving orally at bedtime 20 ml of a C30 dilution of potentiated antiserum to PHENOBARBITAL (5-ethyl-5-phenyl-2,4,6(1H, 3H, 5H)-pyrimidinetrione). At his new visit to the physician 10 days later the normalization of sleep was noted along with a reliable reduction in the frequency of convulsive reactions. D. Patient I., aged 45, with an established diagnosis of generalized form of epilepsy had to give up taking LAMOTRIGINE (6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazine-3,5-diamine) because of nausea. The prescription of a C30 homeopathic solution of monoclonal antibodies to LAMOTRIGINE in the form of 10 intranasal drops 3 times a day instead of LAMOTRIGIN made it possible to eliminate nausea and proceed with the course of treatment. There have been no generalized epileptic fits in the course of 3-months' observation. E. Patient U., aged 39, with an established diagnosis of epilepsy with rare absences was on PHENYTOINE (5,5-diphenyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione) treatment. She complained of dizziness and tremor for which reason and the use of the preparation was discontinued. Instead the oral intake of 20 ml of a D6 dilution of a potentiated antiserum to phenytoine 3 times a day was prescribed. Two days later the patient felt better and her tremor disappeared. No absences were registered within 8 weeks of observation. F. Patient P., aged 49, complained of pain and tension in her gastrocnemius muscles. She gave a history of sciatic neuralgia. In order to reduce the patient's muscular tension the physician prescribed an oral intake of 20 ml of a C30 homeopathized solution of monoclonal antibodies to BACLOPHEN (β-(aminomethyl)-4-chlorobenzenepropanoic acid) 3 times a day in combination with anti-inflammatory therapy. At the new visit 7 days later she stated that her muscular rigidity and pain subsided. EXAMPLE 15 Potentiated Antibodies to Antiparkinsonian Drugs A. Patient D., aged 76, with an established diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome was taking a course of treatment with LEVODOPA (3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine). As the treatment was not very efficient, the additional oral intake of a C15 dilution of monoclonal antibodies to LEVODOPA was prescribed in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day. The elimination of tremor was registered 3 days later, which made it possible to conclude that the therapy became more efficient. Three months later the patient was completely switched to therapy with antibodies. The tremor is insignificant. The general condition of the patient is satisfactory. B. Patient K., aged 69, with an established diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome due to atherosclerosis of cerebral vessels complained of nausea after the intake of SELEGILINE (DEPRENYL) ((R)—N,α-dimethyl-N-2-propenylbenzene ethanamine). The intranasal administration of 10 drops of a D24 dilution of homeopathic solution of antibodies to (R)—N,α-dimethyl-N-2-propenylbenzene ethanamine 3 times a day made it possible to eliminate nausea and to continue the course of treatment with antibodies as monotherapy. EXAMPLE 16 Potentiated Antibodies to Preparations Used Predominantly for the Treatment of the State of Dependence A. Patient B., aged 41, had been taking a course of treatment in order to get rid of his habit of smoking.

The patient stated the lessening of his attraction to smoking after 4 days of the treatment with the preparation. B. Patient D., aged 19, was admitted to hospital on a suspicion of drug addiction. Two hours after the oral administration of 3 ml of a C50 homeopathic solution of antibodies to NALOXONE (5-α)-4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)morphinan-6-one hydrochloride) the development of the withdrawal syndrome was registered, which was regarded as the naloxone-like effect. The further treatment with potentiated antibodies within the framework of combined disintoxication therapy made it possible to arrest the state of abstinence within 4 days. C. Potentiated Antibodies to Disulfiram (Antabuse, (tetraethylthio-peroxydicarbodiamide). Patient E., aged 56, was admitted to the in-patient unit of a hospital with low blood pressure (80/50 mm Hg), suffering from nausea. He presented a history of alcohol intake against the background of ESPERAL (DISULFIRAM) treatment. Five hours after the intranasal administration of 2 ml of a C30 solution of potentiated antibodies to DISULFIRAM the normalization of the patient's blood pressure and the control of nausea were achieved; however, vegetative disorders reappeared when the alcohol test was performed. EXAMPLE 17 Potentiated Antibodies to Narcotic Analgesics A. Patient Ch., aged 22, was admitted to the in-patient unit with signs of heroin withdrawal. In order to control his pain syndrome intramuscular injections of 1 ml of a C50 dilution of polyclonal antiserum to TRAMAL (trans-(+−)-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-3(-metoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol hydrochloride) were given twice in the course of the first hour as monotherapy. The arrest of the pain syndrome was virtually achieved. Conventional disintoxication therapy was prescribed. B. Potentiated Antibodies to Butorphanol (Moradol) (17-cyclobuthylmethyl) morphinan-3,14-diol). Patient R., aged 24, was admitted to a narcological in-patient unit with an opiate withdrawal syndrome; the patient had been taking various opiates for long time (6 months). The oral intake of 30 ml of a C200 homeopathized solution of monoclonal antibodies to MORADOL 3 times a day lessened the intensity of the pain syndrome and the attraction to drugs. C. Potentiated Antibodies to Promedol.

Objective findings: the muscular tension in the left arm was lowered. The intranasal administration of 0.5 ml of a C50 solution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to PHYSOSTIGMINE 3 times a day was prescribed within the framework of combined therapy. After 3 weeks of the treatment normalization of the muscular tension and reflexes was observed. B. Potentiated Antibodies to Proserine (3-[[dimethylamino)carbonyl]-oxy]-N,N,N-trimethylbenzolaminium bromide). Patient Ch., aged 60, after appendectomy suffered from the onset of intestinal paresis in the postoperative period. The oral intake of a C200 dilution of the antiserum to PROSERINE in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was prescribed. After 4 days of the treatment the patient's gastrointestinal tract motility was back to normal. EXAMPLE 19 Potentiated Antibodies to Anti-Glaucoma Drugs 19A. Patient Ya., aged 70, had had a long-time history of glaucoma. The patient had been taking ACETAZOLAMIDE (5-day courses of 250 mg every 6 hours) to good effect. The preparation's mechanism of action involves carbonic anhydrase blocking; on a prolonged use its efficacy is reduced due to compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, it was found necessary to discontinue the use of the preparation from time to time. During these interruptions of the treatment the attacks of glaucoma became more frequent but the patient did not tolerate any other anti-glaucoma drugs. The prescription of a C6 dilution of potentiated antibodies to ACETAZOLAMIDE in a dose of 1 tablet a day resulted in the restoration of the patient's sensitivity to the preparation; his intraocular pressure did not go beyond the upper bound of normal; the frequency of attacks of glaucoma was markedly reduced. ACETAZOLAMIDE intake was discontinued. The term of follow-up was 4 months. EXAMPLE 20 Potentiated Antibodies to Drugs Used for Migraine A. Antibodies to Dihydroergotamine.

He presented a long-time (1.5 month) history of the intake of INDOMETHACINE (1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indole-3-acetic acid). Gastroscopy revealed erosive gastritis. The homeopathized solution of an antiserum to indomethacine (a C30 potency) in the form of 1 tablet 3 times a day was prescribed. At a new examination 7 days later the patient noted that the pain had disappeared. C. Potentiated Antibodies to Cyclooxygenase. Patient F., aged 49, had been suffering from rheumatoid polyarthritis for 12 years. The use of NSAIDs of all groups including MOVALIS (a preparation with a relatively selective effect upon cyclooxygenase-2) was extremely problematic due to concomitant hyperacidic gastritis. With the background treatment with a D12 dilution of a potentiated form of antibodies to cyclooxygenase-1 in a oral dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day the patient tolerated MOVALIS well. The pain in his joints subsided and the joint motility regained. The endoscopic examination showed the remission of hyperacidic gastritis. D. Potentiated Antibodies to Ibuprofen (α-methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl) benzeneacetic acid). Patient L., aged 56, complained of pain and limited motility of her ankle joint. The oral intake of IBUPROFEN in combination with the intranasal administration of 0.5 ml of a C12 dilution of potentiated antibodies to α-methyl-4-(2-methylpropyl) benzolacetic acid twice a day was prescribed.

In addition to halazolin, the patient started receiving orally 10 ml of an aqueous solution of potentiated antibodies to PARACETAMOL 4 times a day. Twelve hours later his body temperature was back to normal and rhinitis subsided. EXAMPLE 23 Potentiated Antibodies to Pharmaceutical Agents Influencing the Function of Respiratory Organs A. Potentiated Antibodies to Phenoterol (1-(3,5-dioxyphenyl)-2-(para-oxy-α-methyl-phenetylamino)-ethanol). Patient K., aged 22, suffering from asthmatic bronchitis used PHENOTEROL (berotec) in an aerosol form as his main therapeutic agent. The patient stated the reliability and efficiency of the preparation but complained of hand tremor and heart palpitations associated with the medication. The use of a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to phenoterol in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day improved the patient's tolerance for the preparation without affecting its efficacy. Gradually the patient was switched to the potentiated preparation as monotherapy. No asthmatic episodes were registered within 5 weeks of observation. Potentiated Antibodies to Atrovent. B. Patient A., aged 26, suffered from polyvalent allergy including intolerance to soybeans and peanuts. He had been successfully receiving ATROVENT (in the form of an inhalation solution) for frequent attacks of bronchial asthma. After a single attempt to use ATROVENT in the form of an inhalation aerosol the patient developed a severe anaphylactic reaction. The latter was arrested by means of three intranasal administrations of 0.5 ml of a D24 dilution of antibodies to atrovent with 20-minutes intervals. Later on the patient started receiving 1 tablet a day of a D12 dilution of antibodies to atrovent every morning as monotherapy. He was feeling well and had no attacks of bronchial asthma in the course of three months. C. Patient A., aged 45, had been taking THEOPHYLLINE for a long time for the attacks of bronchial asthma until he noted the loss of efficiency of the preparation. The oral intake of a C30 dilution of a potentiated solution of antibodies to THEOPHYLLINE (1,3-dimethylxanthine) in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day enhanced the efficacy of the therapy, which allowed the dose of theophylline to be reduced. D. Patient D., aged 36, had been suffering from bronchial asthma since the age of 19. As his attacks occurred at night, he split his daily dose of 600 mg of THEOPECK into ⅔ in the evening and ⅓ in the morning. The patient complained of excessive irritability and the worsening of sleep. An attempt to reduce the dose of the preparation did not result in better sleep but nocturnal asthmatic fits became more frequent. Once the treatment with a C30 dilution of homeopathized antibodies to theophylline in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day had been started, the patient's sleep returned to normal within 3 weeks. The dose of theophylline was reduced to 300 mg, the asthmatic fits became rare. E. Potentiated Antibodies to Menthol (2-isopropyl 5-methylcyclo-hexanol-1). Patient Ch., aged 39, complained of cough and dryness in his throat. The recommendation was to take a tablet of potentiated antibodies to MENTHOL (a C12 dilution) at the onset of a coughing fit.

The treatment was continued with a positive clinical effect. C. Patient Yu., aged 55, suffered from chronic gastritis and esophagitis. He had been taking MOTILIUM (the active principle is DOMPERIDONE, an antagonist of dopamine receptors) for 3 months in a dose of 10 mg 15-20 minutes before meals on his own initiative under the influence of commercial advertising. He sought for medical advice because of gynecomastia he had noticed. Motilium was discontinued and a C1000 dilution of potentiated antiidiopathic antibodies to DOMPERIDONE was prescribed for 2 months in a dose of 1 tablet a day. The symptoms of gynecomastia disappeared and dyspeptic problems never resumed. D. Potentiated Antibodies to Metoclopramide (Reglan, Cerucal) (4-amino-5-chloro-N-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-2-metoxybenzamide). Patient D., aged 38, complained of nausea and belching after meals. A course of treatment with an oral preparation containing a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to METOCLOPRAMIDE (REGLAN, CERUCAL) in a dose of 2 tablets before meals was prescribed. Four days later the patient reported the disappearance of nausea. A conclusion about the efficiency of the preparation was drawn. EXAMPLE 27 Potentiated Antibodies to Antitussive Drugs A. Potentiated Antibodies to Codeine ((5α,6α)-7,8-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-6-ol). Patient B., aged 47, complained of fits of dry cough. The diagnosis was: chronic bronchitis; the intranasal administration of a C200 dilution of an aqueous solution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to CODEINE in a dose of 5 drops during a fit was recommended. Twenty-four hours after the beginning of the treatment the elimination of cough was registered. B. Potentiated Antibodies to Libexin (Prenoxdiazine) (1-[2-[3-(2,2-diphenylethyl)-1,2,4-oxydiazol-5-yl]ethyl]piperidine). Patient T., aged 41, had been taking LIBEXIN tablets for her cough. She complained of dryness in her mouth and throat. LIBEXIN was discontinued. The suggestion was to take orally a C50 dilution of a potentiated antiserum to 1-[2-[3-(2,2-diphenylethyl)-1,2,4-oxydiazol-5-yl]ethyl]piperidine in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day. The administration of the homeopathic preparation eliminated the undesired symptoms within 2 hours. The examination two days later showed a satisfactory general condition of the patient and the absence of cough. EXAMPLE 28 Potentiated Antibodies to Various Groups of Antihypertensive Drugs Potentiated Antibodies to Sympatholythics. A. Potentiated Antibodies to Reserpine Patient B., aged 36, had been taking a course of treatment with ADELPHAN for arterial hypertension. After 3 weeks of the treatment she started complaining of dizziness. The examination revealed that her blood pressure had dropped to 105/60 mm Hg. ADELPHAN was discontinued. The oral intake of a C12 dilution of potentiated antiserum to RESERPINE in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day was prescribed. Two days later her dizziness subsided and the blood pressure rose to 115/70 mm Hg. B. Patient P., aged 72, suffered from hypertensive disease, Stage II b. She had been taking RAUNATINE (1 tablet 2 times a day) for a long time to good effect. The patient complained of dizziness and stuffiness in her nose not associated with a common cold. A C50 dilution of potentiated antibodies to RESERPINE was prescribed; this agent lessened her dizziness and completely eliminated stuffiness in her nose. Later on, she had been taking the preparation for 3 months in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day. Her blood pressure stabilized at a level of 140/90 mm Hg. Potentiated Antibodies to α-Adrenolytic Drugs. C. Potentiated Antibodies to Prazosin (Minipress) (1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-(2-furanylcarbonyl)piperazine). Patient Ch., aged 53, complained of headaches after the intake of PRAZOSIN for hypertensive disease. The prescription of a C30 dilution of a potentiated antiserum to (1-(4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-quinazolinyl)-(2-furanylcarbonyl) piperazine) in a dose of 1 tablet together with the intake of the PRAZOSIN resulted in the lowering of the patient's blood pressure. Later on, he started the administration of the antibodies as monotherapy; the blood pressure did not rise above his optimal level of 150/90 mm Hg. D. Patient I., aged 64, with an established diagnosis of arterial atherosclerosis (predominantly of the vessels of his lower extremities) and hypertensive disease, Stage IIb, had been taking PRAZOSIN in a dose of 8 mg a day (16 tablets). The patient complained of nausea and constant drowsiness. An attempt to reduce the dose on his own initiative resulted in a rise of the blood pressure and reappearance of the pain in his legs. The administration of a C12 dilution of potentiated antibodies to PRAZOSIN in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day made it possible to eliminate the undesirable manifestations and to reduce the dose of PRAZOSIN to 10 mg a day. Two months later the patient switched to the maintaining dose of 1 tablet a day of a C50 dilution of potentiated antibodies to PRAZOSIN. E. Patient Shch., aged 69, has been receiving 1 tablet of OMNIC (400 mg after breakfast) for benign hyperplasia of the prostate. The patient developed symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. The treatment with a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to OMNIC in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was begun. Orthostatic symptoms disappeared 2 days later whereas the therapeutic effect of the preparation was preserved: the patient felt better, the volume of the residual urine diminished and the frequency of urinations reduced. Potentiated Antibodies to Clofeline (2,6-dichloro-N-2-imidazolidinylidenbenzamine). F. Patient E., aged 58, complained of drowsiness after the administration of CLOFELINE she had been taking for hypertensive disease. The recommendation was to combine the intake of CLOFELINE and a C12 solution of monoclonal antibodies to 2,6-dichloro-N2-imidazolidinylidenbenzamine in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day. After two days of the treatment the patient stated the improvement of her mood and an enhanced motor activity. CLOFELINE was gradually discontinued. Now the patient receives only the potentiated drug; the arterial blood is stable. G. Patient Yu., aged 59, had a 10-years' history of essential hypertension. A regular intake of CLOFELINE in a dose of 0.6 mg a day produced a favorable effect on the course of his illness. He sought for medical advice at his district out-patient clinic because of dryness in the mouth. Several weeks of the administration of a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to CLOFELINE in a dose of 15 drops of an aqueous solution 4 times a day resulted in the elimination of the undesirable manifestations. The patient was switched to the potentiated preparation alone as the maintaining therapy. Potentiated Antibodies to Isomers of Nebilet. H. Patient R., aged 63, with an established diagnosis of hypertensive disease, Stage IIa, was on NEBILET treatment (the drug contains two isomers; both are biologically active but their metabolization rate varies in different people). The patient complained of nightmares, which had not been experienced before the NEBILET administration. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the patient belonged to the group with a slow type of metabolism (high difference in the concentrations of L- and D-enantiomers in the plasma). The administration of a D24 dilution of potentiated antibodies to L-isomer in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day resulted in the normalization of sleep along with the conservation of a good hypotensive effect. I. Patient P., aged 67, has been taking LABETALOL (400 mg a day) for hypertensive disease. The patient complained of heavy breathing. A C15 dilution of potentiated antibodies to RR-isomer in an oral dose of 10 ml two times a day was prescribed. After two days of treatment the patient's condition improved and functional tests showed the improvement of bronchial conduction. Potentiated Antibodies to Inactive Isomers of Labetalol. J. Patient A., aged 57, with an established diagnosis of hypertensive disease and ischemic heart disease took LABETALOL and complains of heavy breathing and dizziness. The prescription was: a mixture of a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to inactive isomers in a dose of 1 sachet of powder a day. The patient's condition improved and the dose of the drug was reduced from 400 mg to 50 mg a day. K. Patient Ya., aged 61, with an established diagnosis of hypertensive disease and ischemic heart disease took APRESSIN (HYDRALAZINE) (1-hydrazinophthalazine hydrochloride) 250 mg a day in 4 doses. She complained of headaches, hot flashes, and nausea. An attempt to reduce the dose did not result in the desired effect. The recommendation was start taking a D8 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to the hydrazine group of the APRESSIN molecule; this group is capable of inhibiting the inactivation of endogenous vasodilating factors (NO in particular). After two days of treatment with this preparation in a dose of 1 tablet before meals the patient noticed the improvement of her condition. The treatment with APRESSIN was continued; its dose was reduced without any attenuation of its pronounced therapeutic effect and two months later APRESSIN was discontinued. The patient was put on monotherapy with the antibodies. Potentiated Antibodies to Calcium Channel Blockers. Potentiated Antibodies to Norvask (Amplodipine) (3-ethyl-5-methyl ester of 2-[(2-aminoethoxy)methyl]-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-methyl-l-3,5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid). B. Patient Ch., aged 59, took NORVASK for hypertensive disease. He complained of headache after the intake of the preparation. The prescription was: the intranasal administration of 1 ml of a C1000 dilution of potentiated antiserum to 3-ethyl-5-methyl ester of 2-[(2-aminoethoxy)methyl]-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-methyl-3,5-pyridine dicarboxylic acid once a day in the form of 10 drops to be taken 3 times a day. The next day his headache disappeared. The patient kept taking the two medications together. Six months later the patient was put on monotherapy with the potentiated preparation. Potentiated Antibodies to the Antagonists of ACE and of Angiotensin-2 Receptors. Potentiated Antibodies to Captopril ((S)-1-(3-mercapto-2-methyl-1-oxopropyl)-L-proline): M. Patient L., aged 40, complained of periodical headaches and episodes of hypertension. The oral intake of a C50 homeopathic solution of potentiated anti-bodies to CAPTOPRYL in a dose of 5 ml 2 times a day was recommended. Within 10 days of the treatment a decrease in the frequency of headaches was noticed. Potentiated Antibodies to Losartan (Cozaar) (2-butyl-4-chloro-1-[[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl]methyl]-1H-imidazole-5-methanol). N. Patient G., aged 46, complained of tremor. He had a history of LOSARTAN intake for his hypertensive disease. The recommendation was to take a D24 dilution of potentiated antibodies to 2-butyl-4-chloro-1-[[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl]methyl]-1H-imidazole-5-methanol in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day. After three days of the treatment the tremor disappeared. Later on, in order to keep his blood pressure stable the patient received only potentiated antibodies. O. Patient E., aged 42, with an established diagnosis of essential arterial hypertension had been taking MOXONIDINE in a dose of 300 mg a day. The patient complains of dryness in his mouth and drowsiness. The treatment with a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to MOXONIDINE produced a positive effect. Later on, the patient was put on preventive treatment with antibodies to MOXONIDINE in a dose of 1 tablet a day. P. Patient M., aged 58, with an established diagnosis of essential arterial hypertension, Stage 11b had been taking ENALAPRIL (1-[N—[S]-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-L-alanyl]-L-proline-1′-ethyl ester), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) on her physician's advice in a dose of 20 mg once a day. She complains of cough and dyspepsia. The patient used to take medications for the treatment of the intestinal microflora disorder on her own initiative with no positive results. The bacteriological testing of her intestinal microflora yielded no pathological findings: ENALAPRIL was discontinued. The new therapy scheme included the addition of a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to ENALAPRIL in a dose of 1 tablet once a day. The patient's bowel function normalized and the cough ceased. Q. Patient Z., aged 47; with an established diagnosis of hypertensive disease had been taking VALSARTAN in a dose of 80 mg a day. She complained of incessant cough and pharyngitis. Neither X-ray examination nor phthisiologist's and otolaryngologist's consultations revealed any pathology. The administration of C30 potentiated antibodies to VALSARTAN in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day eliminated the side effects of the preparation. After that the dose of VALSARTAN was reduced first to 40 mg a day and later to 20 mg a day with a stable hypotensive effect. Potentiated Antibodies to Diltiazem. R. Patient C., aged 54, with an established diagnosis of hypertensive disease, ischemic heart disease, angina decubitus had been taking DILTIAZEM in a dose of 40 mg 4 times a day with good clinical effect. Rare attacks of angina: about once a week. After 1.5 month of treatment the patient noticed the slowing of the pulse rate (from 72 to 48-52 beats/min); the ECG indicated the extension of the P-Q interval from 0.12 to 0.20 s. The treatment with a D24 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to DILTIAZEM in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was prescribed. The patient's pulse rate reached 60 beats/min, the P-Q interval shortened to 0.15 s, without angina attacks becoming more frequent. The dosage of DILTIAZEM was reduced to 20 mg 2 times a day. Potentiated Antibodies to Spasmolytic Drugs. Potentiated Antibodies to Dibazole (2-(phenylmethyl)-1H-benzimidazole). S. Patient Z., aged 41, complained of headache and nausea. The diagnosis of hypertensive disease was established and the oral intake of a C12 homeopathic solution of polyclonal antibodies to DIBAZOLE in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day was recommended. Ten days later the patient reported feeling better and not suffering from headaches. EXAMPLE 29 Potentiated Antibodies to Substances Taking Part in Natural Regulation of the Blood Pressure A. Patient S., aged 46, had been sent to hospital within several years because of hypertension crises. Once a crisis had been arrested the patient was put on the maintaining therapy with captopril. In order to enhance the hypotensive effect a C12 dilution of potentiated antibodies to RENIN in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day was added to the treatment. Combined therapy made it possible for the first time in many years to lower the patient's blood pressure to 140/100 mm Hg. The patient's condition is satisfactory. B. Patient H., aged 38, suffered from therapy-resistant essential hypertension. The closest to optimal drug for the patient was ENALAPRIL, which made it possible to stabilize the blood pressure at 160/110 mm Hg. The treatment protocol with an added intake of a D24 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME (in a dose of 15 drops of alcohol solution 3 times a day) made it possible to lower the patient's systolic pressure to 120-130 mm Hg. The patient had not presented any complaints for 2 months. C. Patient D., aged 19, had been suffering from therapy-resistant arterial hypertension for 6 months. The use of a C12 dilution of potentiated antibodies to ANGIOTENSIN II in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day made it possible to stabilize the patient's condition: no complaints, the blood pressure reached 120/75 mm Hg. EXAMPLE 30 Potentiated Antibodies to Diuretic Drugs Potentiated Antibodies to Furosemide (5-(aminosulfonyl)-4-chloro-2-[(2-furanylmethyl)]aminobenzoic acid). A. Patient D., aged 67, had been taking a course of treatment with FUROSEMIDE for edemata caused by cardiac failure. She complained of nausea and the lack of appetite. Furosemide was discontinued. The recommendation was to start the oral intake of a C30 aqueous solution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to 5-(aminosulfonyl)-4-chloro-2-[(2-furanylmethyl)]aminobenzoic acid 2 times a day in a dose of 20 ml. A new examination 7 days later revealed the improved appetite, the absence of nausea and edemata. Potentiated Antibodies to Hypothiazide (6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide-1,1-dioxide). B. Patient N., aged 64, with established diagnosis of hypertensive disease had been taking HYPOTHIAZIDE. The patient noticed a decrease in the efficacy of the preparation; hence, HYPOTHIAZIDE was discontinued. The recommendation was to start the oral intake of a C200 dilution of a potentiated antiserum to HYPOTHIAZIDE in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day, which made it possible to pre-serve the diuretic effect after HYPOTHIAZIDE had been discontinued. EXAMPLE 31 Potentiated Antibodies to Cardiotropic Drugs Potentiated Antibodies to Nitrates. Potentiated Antibodies to Nitrosorbide (1,4,3,6-dianghydrido-D-glucitol dinitrate). A. Patient Sh., aged 52, suffering from hypertensive disease complained of headache after the first intake of NITROSORBIDE. In addition to the conventional treatment, the oral intake of a C20 dilution of potentiated antiserum to NITROSORBIDE was prescribed in a dose of 10 ml 3 times a day. Seven days later the patient reported an improved tolerance to NITROSORBIDE and the lessening of pain. Potentiated Antibodies to Nitroglycerol. B. Patient U., aged 71, had been taking NITROSORBIDE (40 mg a day, 4 tablets) for 5 weeks for ischemic heart disease and angina of effort along with NITROGLYCEROL as needed (up to 8-10 tablets a day). Within the last week the dose of NITROSORBIDE was increased to 6 tablets, and that of NITROGLYCEROL, to 15-16 tablets as the angina attacks grew more frequent. The prescription was to take a C6 dilution of potentiated antibodies to NITROGLYCEROL in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day. After 5 days of treatment a marked reduction in the frequency of attacks was achieved, which made it possible to reduce the dose of NITROSORBIDE to 4 tablets and that of NITROGLYCEROL to 1-2 tablets a day. Potentiated Antibodies to Cytochromes a+a3. C. Patient G., aged 39, was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of hypertensive disease, ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure due to myocardial infarction; he had been treated with intravenous infusions of SODIUM NITROPRUSSIDE (sodium nitrozylpentacyanoferrate) in a dose of 100 mg a day for 4 days. By the 5th day the hypotensive effect of the preparation had significantly decreased as sodium cyanide accumulating as a result of SODIUM NITROPRUSSIDE metabolism played an important part in the pharmacological effect of the preparation. (Cyanides act as blockers of the mitochondria respiratory chain at the level of Cytochrome a+a3). The administration of a C200 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to CYTOCHROMES a+a3 in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day restored the efficacy of SODIUM NITROPRUSSIDE. Potentiated Antibodies to β-Adrenoblockers. Potentiated Antibodies to Atenolol (4-[2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methylethyl) amino]propoxy]benzeneacetamide). D. Patient E., aged 32, complained of episodes of tachycardia caused by overfatigue. Electrocardiography revealed no organic lesions. ATENOLOL was discontinued. The oral intake of a C12 dilution of a potentiated antiserum to ATENOLOL was prescribed. The intake of the preparation in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day resulted in a decrease both in the intensity and duration of episodes of tachycardia 5 days after the beginning of treatment. Potentiated Antibodies to Anaprilin (Propranolol) (1-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2-propanol). E. Patient I., aged 54, sought for medical advice for periodic heavy breathing. She presented a history of a regular intake of ANAPRILIN (PROPRANOLOL). The intranasal administration of a C12 dilution of a potentiated solution of monoclonal antibodies to 1-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-3-(1-naphthalenyloxy)-2-propanol in a dose of 0.5 ml 2 times a day was prescribed as monotherapy. A new examination 7 days later showed an improvement of the respiratory function. A conclusion about the efficacy of the homeopathic preparation was drawn. F. Patient A., aged 57, developed bradyarrhythmia with Morgagni-Adams-Stokes attacks after myocardial infarction. To prevent attacks she took ORCIPRENALINE (½ tablet 6 times a day) and complained of nausea, dryness in her mouth, and the tremor of her hands. The treatment with a D3 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to ORCIPRENALINE (in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day) made it possible to eliminate the unpleasant sensations; the attacks of arrhythmia stopped recurring. Potentiated Antibodies to Cardiac Glycosides. Potentiated Antibodies to Digitoxin ((3β5β)-3-[(O-2,6-dideoxy-β-D-ribo-hexapyranosyl-(1-4)-O-2,6-dideoxy-β-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl)-(1-4)-2,6-didesoxy-β-D-ribo-hexapyranosyl)oxy]-14-hydroxycard-20(22)-enolide). G. Patient B., aged 68, had been taking a course of treatment with DIGITOXIN for cardiac failure complained of nausea associated with the intake of the preparation. The additional prescription was the oral intake of a C200 dilution of a potentiated preparation of polyclonal antibodies to ((3β,5β)-3-[(O-2,6-dideoxy-β-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl-(1-4)-O-2,6-dideoxy-β-D-ribo-hexopyranosyl)-(1-4)-2,6-dideoxy-β-D-ribo-hexapyranosyl)oxy]-14-hydroxycard-20(22)-enolide) in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day. After two days of the treatment the patient noticed the disappearance of nausea. The intake of the homeopathic preparation made it possible to improve the patient's tolerance of DIGITOXIN and to reduce gradually its dose to ¼ of a tablet 2 times a day. H. Patient Ch., aged 31, with an established diagnosis of chronic cardiac failure caused by rheumatic heart disease had been taking the maintaining dose of DIGITOXIN 0.75 mg a day (3 tablets). She suffered from permanent nausea and periodical vomiting. An attempt to reduce the dose of DIGITOXIN resulted in the enhancement of manifestations of cardiac failure, edema in the first place. With DIGITOXIN discontinued, the patient started receiving a D6 dilution of potentiated antiidiotypic antibodies to DIGITOXIN (in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day). Two weeks later the patient's condition was satisfactory: the blood pressure became stable and no manifestations of cardiac failure were observed Potentiated Antibodies to Antiarrhythmic Drugs. Potentiated Antibodies to Disopyramide (α-[2-[bis(1-methylethyl) amino]ethyl]-α-phenyl-2-pyridine acetamide). I. Patient S., aged 35, complained of restlessness and tachycardia. The oral intake of a C200 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to RYTHMILEN (DISOPYRAMIDE) (α-[2-[bis(1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl]-α-phenyl-2-pyridine acetamide) in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day was prescribed. At the new examination the patient presented no complaints for tachycardia. Potentiated Antibodies to Rhythmonorm. J. Patient Zh., aged 45, has been taking RHYTHMONORM (Propaphenone) (2[2-hydroxy-3-(propylamino)propoxy]-3-phenyl-propiophen-one), an antiarrhythmic drug of the IC class) in a dose of 150 mg 3 times a day for ventricular extrasystoles. The planned blood test revealed leukopenia (3.8×103/μl) and thrombocytopenia (170×103/μl). Rhythmonorm was discontinued. The administration of a C50 dilution of potentiated antibodies to PROPAPHENONE in a dose of 1 tablet in the morning within 10 days resulted in the normalization of the patient's blood picture with preserved antiarrhythmic effect. Potentiated Antibodies to Sotalol (N-[4-[1-hydroxy-2-[(1-methylethyl) amino]ethyl]phenyl]methane sulfonamide) K. Patient D., aged 28, complained of night episodes of pulse intermittence, mild pain in the left part of her thorax. Electrocardiography revealed no organic lesions of the myocardium. After the preceding therapy had been cancelled, the patient started the oral intake of a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to SOTALOL (N-[4-[1-hydroxy-2-[(1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl]phenyl]methane sulfonamide) in a dose of 1 tablet at bedtime. During the following 10 days there were no attacks of arrhythmia or pain. Potentiated Antibodies to Verapamil (α-[3-[[2-(3,4-dimetoxyphenyl)ethyl]methylamino]propyl]-3,4-dimetoxy-α-(1-methylethyl)benzene-acetonitryl). L. Patient K., aged 34, complained of headache, tachycardia, and overfatigue. The examination revealed elevated blood pressure (140/90). The recommendation was to take nasal drops of a C200 aqueous solution of potentiated antibodies to VERAPAMIL (α-[3-[[2-(3,4-dimetoxyphenyl)ethyl]methylamino]propyl]-3,4-dimetoxy-α-(1-methylethyl)benzeneacetonitryl) in a dose of 0.5 ml at bedtime. The patient reported feeling better, his blood pressure dropped to the normal level after two days of the treatment. It was recommended to continue the course of treatment. M. Patient Z., aged 55, with an established diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, angina of effort, atrial extrasystoles, and tachycardia (90 beats/min) had been taking 240 mg of ISOPTIN daily in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day. The patient complained of constipation not associated with the regimen faults or diet changes. The intake of potentiated antibodies to ISOPTIN LM 50 in a dose of 1 tablet 2 times a day resulted in the normalization of the bowel function without interfering with the basic therapeutic effect of ISOPTIN. Later on, the dose of ISOPTIN was gradually reduced and finally ISOPTIN was discontinued. The patient's condition remained satisfactory for two months against the background of therapy with antibodies. N. Patient D., aged 63, with the diagnosis of progressive chronic cardiac failure was treated at the cardiology unit of a clinical hospital (intravenous infusion of 30 mg of MILRINONE daily in a dose of 10 ml 3 times a day). As the patient's myocardial contractive capacity and hemodynamic indices were gradually improving, there appeared complaints of heartache. ECG revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. The treatment with a C12 dilution of potentiated antibodies to MILRINONE in a-dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was started. Heartache disappeared, the ECG pattern returned to normal, and the treatment with MILRINONE was continued. Gradually the preparation was discontinued and the patient was switched to the treatment with antibodies alone in a dose of 1 tablet a day. The patient's condition is satisfactory. O. Patient S., aged 58, had been taking MILRINONE for 1.5 years for chronic cardiac failure. In the course of the period of treatment the daily dose had to be increased from 10 to 30 mg because of the developing resistance to the preparation. After the prescription of a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to the enzyme PHOSPHODIESTERASE in a dose of 1 sublingual tablet once a day to be taken in the morning the patient's condition markedly improved: the ECG signs of myocardial overload and ischemia became less pronounced and peripheral edema disappeared. Three months of a regular intake of potentiated antibodies made it possible to reduce the daily dose of MILRINONE to 10 mg. Potentiated Antibodies to Cordaron. P. Patient S., aged 50, had been suffering from stable angina of effort with paroxysms of ciliary arrhythmia for 2 years. From the onset of his illness the patient had been taking CORDARON in a dose of 600 mg a day (3 tablets). After a year of the treatment an increase in the frequency of paroxysms of ciliary arrhythmia was registered. Paroxysms occurred every day; an increase in the dose of CORDARON as well as the administration of other antiarrhythmic drugs was inefficient. No physical or emotional strain accounted for the paroxysms; the paroxysms cease spontaneously. This condition seemed indicative of a thyroid function disorder; the patient was examined by an endocrinologist who established the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis of a moderate severity. The patient's thyroid profile looked as follows: TTH 1.29 mlU/l (the normal range is 0.45-6.2), total T4 180.3 nmol/l (the normal range is 39-155), T33.2 nmol/l (the normal range is 1.2-3.1). The treatment with a C24 dilution of potentiated antibodies to CORDARON in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was started. Within a month the euthyroid state was achieved. Now the patient takes CORDARON in a dose of 100 mg a day (¼ of a tablet 2 times a day), paroxysms of ciliary arrhythmia are rare (about once a week). EXAMPLE 32 Potentiated Antibodies to Hypocholesterolemic Drugs Potentiated Antibodies to Probucol. A. Patient K., aged 62, with the diagnosis of-coronary sclerosis, angina of effort, and hypercholesterolemia had been taking PROBUCOL for 2 months along with antianginal drugs (in a dose of 500 mg 2 times a-day at mealtime). The patient complained of dyspepsia, meteorism in the first place, the onset of which dated back to one month after he had started taking the preparation. The administration of a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to PROBUCOL in a dose of 1 tablet a day controlled the patient's intestinal disorders. The daily dose of PROBUCOL was reduced by 50%. Potentiated Antibodies to Nicotinic Acid. B. Patient L., aged 58, had been taking NICOTINIC ACID in a dose of 4.0 g a day for atherosclerosis of peripheral vessels (especially pronounced in the lower extremities). The patient complains of hot flashes and redness of the face. The intake of a C12 dilution of potentiated antibodies to nicotinic acid in a-dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day improved the patient's tolerance of the preparation and made it possible to reduce its dose to 1.0 g a day. Potentiated Antibodies to Pravastatin. Patient F., aged 57, suffered from ischemic heart disease and primary hypercholesterolemia. He had been taking PRAVASTATIN for 3 months in a dose of 20 mg at bedtime along with NITROGLYCEROL (up to 5-6 tablets a day for angina attacks). In the course of the last 10-15 days he noticed the development of muscular weakness. The biochemical analysis of the patient's blood revealed transaminase levels elevated to the upper bound (ALT 50 lU/l, AST 45 lU/l). The administration of a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to PRAVASTATIN in a dose of 1 tablet once a day resulted in the improvement of the patient's condition of health, his blood transaminase level lowered (ALT 26 lU/l, AST 21 lU/l). Angina attacks became less frequent and the patient's intake of nitroglycerol tablets reduced to 1-2 tablets a day. Potentiated Antibodies to Etofibrate. D.

The recommendation was to take drops of a solution (a D24 dilution) of an antiserum to the antibiotic CEFEPIM ([[7-([[2-amino-4-thiazolyl) (metoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-methylpyrrolidinium hydroxide) 3 times a day. Five days later the inflammatory reaction subsided and tonsillitis disappeared. D. Patient Zh., aged 33, was directed to the proctology unit of a clinical hospital with an established diagnosis of perianal abscess. Within the framework of therapy the patient was receiving AMOXYCLAV (a combination of semisynthetic penicillin amoxycillin and clavulonic acid, an inhibitor of β-lactamases), 1 tablet 3 times a day. The patient used to take various antibiotics on his own initiative and without system, including phenoxymethylpenicillin. Along with the amelioration of his general condition (the lowering of the body temperature, the lessening of pain, and the reduction of the white blood count), the patient started complaining of nausea. Following his doctor's advice, the patient began to take AMOXYCLAV at meals; however, nausea persisted. A 7-days' course of the treatment with a C6 dilution of potentiated antibodies to 6-aminopenicillanic acid (common for all penicillins) in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was carried out. The tolerance of the preparation improved; the patient presented no complaints, no indications for surgical treatment were seen; as the blood count and the body temperature were back to normal, the patient was discharged from hospital under local polyclinic observation. Recommendations for the regimen and further treatment were given. E. Patient V., aged 34, suffered from severe bilateral polysegmentary pneumonia with a II-III degree of respiratory failure, chronic alcoholism, chronic hepatitis, secondary immunodeficiency. The patient started receiving MAXINIM (cephalosporin of the IV generation) in a dose of 1.0 gram intramuscularly every 12 hours. At the 3rd day of the treatment the patient's condition ameliorated, dyspnea and cough subsided, and the body temperature went down. However, the paint started complaining of nausea, his functional liver tests showed elevated values of ALT and AST. The treatment protocol was completed with a C50 dilution of potentiated antibodies to MAXINIM in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day. The patient's condition kept improving, the nausea disappeared, and the ALT and AST values dropped to the upper bound of normal. F. Patient K., aged 46, was taking RULIDE for acute prostatitis in a dose of 150 mg twice a day. After three days of the treatment the symptoms of prostatitis subsided but the patient started complaining of dizziness and distorted smell and taste of food. The treatment with a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to RULIDE in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day was started and within three days the taste and odor perception was back to normal and dizziness disappeared. G. Patient G., aged 25, suffered from the exacerbation of chronic adnexitis after criminal abortion, polynarcomania, and secondary immunodeficiency. She was treated with CIPROBAY (125 mg 2 times a day). After 6 days of the treatment the patient felt better; however, she started having fainting spells and hot flashes. A C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to CIPROBAY in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day was prescribed. Within the days the patient's complaints disappeared, her condition became satisfactory. H. Patient Sh., aged 44, had been treated with CIPROFLOXACIN for the exacerbation of chronic suppurative obstructive bronchitis. The choice of the drug had been based on the results provided by the antibioticogram; the repeated use if this medication had been giving clinical success. However, in this case no positive bronchological dynamics was achieved after 2 weeks of treatment. The antibiotic was discontinued and the treatment with a C6 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to CIPROFLOXACIN in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day began. Within ten days all symptoms of bronchial obstruction disappeared, no suppurative mucus was seen during bronchoscopy. A conclusion was drawn on the anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory effects of potentiated antibodies. I. Patient I., aged 42, was staying in a phthisiologic hospital with an established diagnosis of infiltrative tuberculosis of the upper lobe of the right lung in the phase of disintegration and dissemination, with bacterioexcretion. After three months of the treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, and streptomycin positive clinical and X-ray dynamics was achieved. However, the subsequent two months of the treatment with the antibacterial drugs did not bring any significant improvement of the patient's condition: infiltration and a cavern in the upper lobe of the right lung persisted and showed no tendency for a further reduction; the release of bacteria persisted as well. The in vitro resistance to antibiotics was not found at the initial stage of examinations or five months later. The treatment with a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to ISONIAZID, RIFAMPICIN, and STREPTOMYCIN in a dose of 1 tablet of each preparation daily made it possible to achieve positive X-ray dynamics within two months; the release of bacteria stopped. J. Patient Ch., aged 36, was staying at the infectious hospital for amebic dysentery. After four days of the administration of ORNIDAZOLE (1.0 g per diem) the patient started complaining of somnolence and dizziness. The additional treatment with a C12 dilution of potentiated antibodies to ORNIDAZOLE in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day resulted in the elimination of the undesirable effects within subsequent four days. EXAMPLE 41 Potentiated Antibodies to Chelating Agents A. Patient D., aged 44, was undergoing a course of treatment with DOXORUBICIN (75 mg administrated intravenously once in 3 weeks) at the in-patient unit of an oncological dispensary for III degree breast cancer. For the prevention of myocardiopathy the patient was receiving CARDIOXANE intravenously 30 minutes before the injection of the cytostatic drug. The patient tolerated DOXORUBICIN well enough with a background treatment with CARDIOXANE; however, her hemoglobin level dropped to 70 g/l. It was suggested to include the administration of a C30 dilution of potentiated antibodies to CARDIOXANE in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day in the treatment protocol. Within subsequent three months the remission of the main disease was achieved and maintained; no signs of cardiac failure were observed and the hemoglobin level was 95-100 g/l. EXAMPLE 42 Potentiated Antibodies to Anti-Gout Drugs A. Patient Kh., aged 49, with the diagnosis of hypertensive disease and chronic gout had been taking 1.5 g of PROBENECIDE daily for the prevention of gout exacerbation caused by a diuretic (hypothiazide) he was receiving for his hypertension. The patient complained of nausea, weakness and painful sensation in his gums. The treatment with a C12 dilution of potentiated antibodies to PROBENECIDE in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day was started and three days later the patient started feeling better. The treatment with hypothiazide and PROBENECIDE was continued; the PROBENECIDE dose was reduced by 50% with no negative effect on the therapeutic action. B. Patient V., aged 51, had been taking (on his physician's advice) IMODIUM (LOPERAMIDE) for chronic-diarrhea caused not by infection (presumably by heavy metal salts). The patient stated that the overall effect of the drug was positive but complained of dizziness. The treatment with a C50 dilution of potentiated antibodies to the piperidine group of IMODIUM in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day was started and after five days of the therapy with antibodies the unpleasant sensations ceased (with a persisting therapeutic effect of the drug). EXAMPLE 43 Potentiated Antibodies to Autologous Antigens Potentiated Antibodies to DNA Antigens. Patient P., aged 24, with clinical diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus accompanied by kidney affection (nephrotic type glomerulonephritis) and heart injury (myocarditis), subacute course, III degree of activity had been taking prednisolone (50 mg daily) and curantyl (200 mg daily). Because of the lessening of the effect of prednisolone she was began to receive potentiated polyclonal antibodies to native DNA isolated from lymphocytes of the patient's peripheral blood. Antibodies were obtained by immunization of a rabbit with subsequent purification of the antiserum and its potentiation based on homeopathic technology. The intake of a C1000 dilution of potentiated antibodies to autoantigens of DNA in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day resulted in a marked inhibition of the activity of the autoimmune process within two weeks. The laboratory findings were as follows: ESR decreased from 50 to 16 mm/h, the titer of the antinuclear factor lowered. Catamnesis: 6 months of the intake of potentiated antibodies gave clinical and laboratory remission. EXAMPLE 44 Potentiated Antibodies to Rhesus (Rh) Factor Patient S., aged 28, Rh− (her husband was Rh+) was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of an 8-weeks pregnancy. This was her fourth pregnancy. She had a history of normal first pregnancy ending with normal delivery, the second pregnancy was interrupted by medical abortion at the term of 10 weeks, and the third pregnancy ended with antenatal death of the fetus because of the Rh conflict at the term of 38 weeks. In order to prevent the Rh conflict and to maintain the current pregnancy she started to take a C200 dilution of polyclonal potentiated antibodies to Rh factor beginning with the 8th week in a dose of 1 tablet twice a week. Catamnesis: the therapy favored uncomplicated pregnancy, which ended with labor at term. The baby (Rh+) was healthy without symptoms of hemolytic disease. EXAMPLE 45 Potentiated Antibodies to Substances Causing Intoxication and/or dependence Potentiated Antibodies to Opiates. A. Patient S., aged 28, had an almost uninterrupted 5-year history of intravenous self-injections of crude homemade acetylated opium (sultyga). He was admitted to a narcological unit 24 hours after the last injection. The patient was irritated and gloomy and complained of intense pains in his extremities, chills, and insomnia. The oral intake of 10 drops of a C200 dilution of a potentiated aqueous solution of natural antibodies to morphine hydrochloride every 15-30 minutes was prescribed. The antibodies had been isolated by affinity chromatography from the serum of a patient with chronic morphine dependency. The therapy resulted in a quick disappearance of vegetative disorders and the lessening of the intensity of the myalgia. Six hours after the beginning of the therapy the patient went to sleep. Two days later the withdrawal symptoms virtually disappeared. A conclusion was drawn on the sufficiency of monotherapy with antibodies to morphine in the case of the opiate withdrawal syndrome. B. Patient K., aged 21, was admitted to a narcology unit with typical manifestations of the opiate withdrawal syndrome. Questioning revealed that she had been abusing crude homemade extract of poppy seed straw (koknar) in the form of intravenous self-injections in the course of two years. A combined therapy with a C1000 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to morphine in a dose of 1 tablet once in 2 hours and a C200 dilution of potentiated antibodies to codeine in a dose of 1 tablet in the morning and 1 at bedtime was prescribed. Within 48 hours all manifestations of the withdrawal syndrome were completely arrested. C. Patient I., aged 42, was emergently admitted to a narcology unit with the diagnosis of codeine overdosage. The patient was somnolent and had periodic bouts of nausea. The examination revealed depressed reflexes, bradycardia, and moderate hypotension. The patient was put on a slow intravenous infusion of 200 ml of an isotonic solution containing polyclonal potentiated antibodies to opiates of the phenotrene group mixed in the following proportions: 1 ml of a C200 dilution of antibodies to morphine; 1 ml of a C1000 dilution to codeine; 1 ml of a C50 dilution to thebaine; 1 ml of a C30 dilution to pseudomorphine; 1 ml of a C12 dilution of antibodies to neopine. Within two hours after the beginning of the treatment the symptoms of intoxication completely disappeared. D. Patient D., aged 16, had been inhaling heroin at least three times a week in the course of the last 1.5 months. On his parents' accord he was hospitalized in a restricted admission unit for 24 days. Two days after admission he became irritable, developed sleeping disorders, and complained of attraction to the drug when talking to his physician. The prescription was: a C1000 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to HEROIN in a dose of 1 tablet 6 times a day. Three weeks later the patient reported even mood and satisfactory sleep and appetite. During individual talks with a psychologist he denied having attraction to the drug. It was recommended to keep taking antibodies to heroin in a dose of 1 tablet a day. Two months after his discharge from hospital he (according to his mother's information) has never been noticed taking drugs. E. Patient Kh., aged 24, had been injecting intravenously some crude homemade heroin preparations for three years. He was admitted to a narcology unit in a state of sopor. In view of the inefficiency of potentiated antibodies to heroin during his previous treatment, it was recommended to start the oral administration of a mixture of aqueous solutions of monoclonal antibodies to the following synthetic and semisynthetic opiates: a C50 dilution of antibodies to dionine (ethylmorphine); a C1000 dilution to promedol: a C30 dilution to phentanyl. Thirty minutes later the patient became fully conscious and oriented in time. H is reflexes were moderately depressed. He told the physicians that he had self-injected a dose of an unknown drug at the discotheque. Potentiated Antibodies to Barbiturates and Other Soporific Drugs. F. Patient B., aged 32, was admitted to an intensive care unit in the status epilepticus. According to his relatives, he had been taking various drugs of the barbiturate group both orally and intravenously in the course of the last years. The intravenous infusion of the following mixture of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to barbiturates was prescribed: a C50 dilution of antibodies to barbamyl (amytal sodium); a C200 dilution to nembutal (ethaminal sodium); a C1000 dilution to fanodorm (cyclobarbital) in a dose of 1 ml each. Within 15 minutes after the beginning of the therapy the status epilepticus was controlled, the patient lapsed into a stunned condition. During further observation at the hospital the patient was irritated and suffered from insomnia and dysphoria from time to time. He tried to get hold of soporific drugs. An interview revealed that he had also been taking drugs of the ureide group (bromural) and noxyron besides barbiturates. In view of this the patient was advised to take a C50 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to bromural in combination with a C200 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to noxyron 1 tablet alternately every two hours. The patient's condition seriously improved: there was no dysphoria, he became less torpid, and his sleep was back to normal. He stopped searching for soporific drugs and was discharged in a satisfactory condition. Potentiated Antibodies to Cannabinoids. G. Patient S., aged 24, was admitted to a psychiatric unit with pronounced depressive disorders. He had had a long history of hashish use (up to 5-8 joints a day). As the treatment with antidepressants proved inefficient, the oral intake of 10 ml of an aqueous solution containing the following mixture of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to cannabinoids: a C50 dilution of antibodies to canabidiol; a C30 dilution to cannabinol; a C200 dilution to (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol. After 10 days of the treatment the patient's mood became even and his sleep was back to normal. Two weeks after the beginning of the treatment with anti-bodies the patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition. H. Patient D., aged 14, had been using drugs for 6 months. She used to chew the so-called bang (hashish tar). She was willing to be treated and his district narcologist prescribed potentiated monoclonal antibodies to cannabinoids in a dose of 1 tablet every morning according to the following scheme: a C50 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol during the first two weeks of the month and potentiated monoclonal antibodies to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid during the last two weeks. Six months of medical observation showed that the patient had given up drug abuse. The patient is socially adapted and continues her studies. Potentiated Antibodies to Cocaine and Its Metabolites. I. Patient S., aged 28, had been using crack (a mixture of cocaine with baking soda) for 1.5 years. He was admitted to a therapeutic unit with the diagnosis of cachexy caused by chronic hepatitis of an unknown origin. Two weeks of health-improving therapy and hepatotropic treatment did not produce any significant effect. In order to control asthenic symptoms the treatment was supplemented with tablets of a C50 dilution of monoclonal potentiated antibodies to cocaine (in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day). After three weeks of the treatment the preparation was substituted by tablets containing polyclonal antibodies to cocaine metabolites: a C50 dilution of antibodies to benzoylecgonine and a C200 dilution of antibodies to ecgonine. The treatment resulted in the normalization of the patient's mood and sleep; he gained 18 kg of weight. Two months after the beginning of the therapy the patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition. J. Patient O., aged 17, was brought to the narcological restricted admission unit by her parents. In the course of the last two months she had been self-injecting cocaine solutions intravenously. An interview with a psychologist revealed signs of a psychic dependence on this drug. The prescription was: a C50 dilution of polyclonal antibodies to a cocaine metabolite, norcocaine, in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day during the first 10 days of hospital stay. The same pattern was applied to her second 10 days of hospital stay (a C200 dilution of polyclonal antibodies to methylecgonine) and to the third 10-days' period (a C1000 dilution of polyclonal antibodies to hydroxycocaine) in the third decade of her hospital stay. The treatment with homeopathic doses of antibodies to cocaine metabolites resulted in a considerable improvement of the patient's condition of health: her mood became even and her sleep was back to normal. A test before discharge one month later revealed no signs of psychic dependence. Catamnesis four months later: the patient is socially adapted and has not been noticed using drugs. Potentiated Antibodies to Benzodiazepines. K. Patient S. aged 38, had a 20-year long history of the abuse of tranquilizers and psychotropic drugs of the benzodiazepine group. Against the background of the drug abuse the patient developed a psychoorganic syndrome with predominant astheno-apathic symptoms and the patient was granted the 2nd degree of disability. The scheme of nootropic treatment prescribed by the district physician involved a long-term intake of polyclonal potentiated antibodies to a number of benzodiazepines, namely, a C50 dilution of antibodies to chlozepid; a C50 dilution to diazepam; a C200 dilution to oxazepam; a C200 dilution to nitrazepam; a C1000 dilution to lorazepam. As a result a C1000 dilution of polyclonal potentiated antibodies to clonazepam proved to be the best choice for the patient. He had been taking them every day in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day for 14 months, which resulted in the improvement of his intellectual capacities and memory. Now his behavior is well ordered; the patient is capable of taking care of himself; his mother reports that he hasn't been using any sedatives during this period. Potentiated Antibodies to Phenylalkylamines and Other Stimulants. L. Patient C., aged 26, was admitted to a psychiatry department with the diagnosis of psychosis caused by ephedron abuse. Among the symptoms anxiety, alertness, alarming expectations, and paranoid attitude prevailed. The intravenous administration of a C50 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to ephedron in a dose of 1 ml twice within the first hour of treatment was prescribed. After 1.5 hours of the therapy psychotic disorders disappeared. The patient's attitude to his delusional episode is critical. M. Patient Kh., aged 41, engaged at diplomatic service was admitted to a intensive care unit because of a long period (about 18 hours) of somnolence. According to his wife's information, the patient used to indulge alone in an intravenous administration of some stimulants but definitely not cocaine. The prescription was: a slow intravenous infusion of physiological saline solution containing 1 ml of a C50 dilution of potentiated antibodies to amphetamine and 1 ml a C30 dilution of polyclonal potentiated antibodies to methamphetamine. Within fifteen minutes the lethargic symptoms were arrested. The patient was fully conscious and well oriented. He told the physician that he had administered a single dose of amphetamine intravenously. N. Patient T., aged 17, administered himself ephedrine intravenously three times in the course of the last month for the first time in his life. On his own initiative he went to seek for narcologist's advice, as he was afraid of becoming an addict. The prescription was: the intake of a combined preparation containing polyclonal antibodies to ephedrine and polyclonal antibodies to norephedrine in a potentiated form (dilutions C50 and C200, respectively) in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day. For half a year the patient paid regular visits to his physician twice a month and reported no episodes of ephedrine use during this period. O. Patient L., aged 25, sought for narcologist's advice on his own initiative. After 1.5 years of imprisonment he had become addicted to chifir (an extra strong tea brew) and used it at least 1-2-times a day. C50 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) in a dose of 1 tablet twice a day. During his subsequent visits the patient stated that he had been drinking chifir very rarely (not more often than once a week) but could not give it up altogether. Potentiated Antibodies to Hallucinogens (Psychedelic Drugs). P. Patient K., aged 28, was brought to the psychiatric department from a hotel where he had attracted the hotel staffs attention by his inadequate behavior: he was contemplating something, used to freeze suddenly and stand motionless; he was poorly oriented in the situation around him. In response to physician's questions the patient answered that he used to take pieces of blotting paper impregnated with LSD, sublingually. A single dose (1 ml) of a C200 dilution of a solution containing potentiated polyclonal antibodies to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was administered. Fifteen minutes after the administration of the preparation the psychotic disorders were arrested. Q. Two A. brothers, aged 16 and 19, with the diagnosis of poisoning with dried ink fungi were admitted to a psychiatric unit. As the quantity of potentiated preparation available at that moment at the unit was insufficient, one of the patients received intravenously 1 ml of a C200 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to psilocin and the other, 1 ml of a C50 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to psilocybin. Within an hour the condition of both patients returned to normal, their excitement and unrestraint disappeared, and they both went to sleep. A conclusion was drawn on high efficiency of both preparations. R. Patient D., aged 19, was admitted to a neurology unit for manifestations of catalepsia. In view of the fact that the patient had been taking the drug phenycyclidine (PCP), she underwent hourly intramuscular administrations of 1 ml of a D3 dilution of the solution of potentiated antibodies to phenycyclidine. Within three hours the cataleptic syndrome was completely arrested. S. Patient A., aged 38, has the 2nd degree of disability because of paranoid schizophrenia. For fifteen years he had been taking high daily doses of haloperidol in combination with parcopan or cyclodol for the prevention of narcolepsia and had already developed physical dependence on them. The attending physician started reducing gradually the dose of cyclodol ending up with replacing it completely with a C30 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to cyclodol in a dose of 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet at bedtime every day. The patient keeps taking haloperidol and doesn't have any neuroleptic symptoms; no requests for cyclodol prescription. Potentiated Antibodies to Alkaloids of Tobacco. T. Patient I., aged 29, consulted a narcologist for tobacco smoking. Because the neuropharmacological preparations he used to take earlier had not succeeded to rid him of the bad habit, the physician prescribed a C200 dilution of a potentiated antiserum to nicotine in a dose of 1 tablet 3 times a day. Catamnesis 3 months later was as follows: in the course of the first weeks of the therapy with antibodies the patient's craving for tobacco was enhanced and he smoked more often. Later on, the situation changed, his craving receded, he was able to gradually reduce the number of smoked cigarettes and finally to give up smoking altogether. Potentiated Antibodies to Alcohol. U. Patient B., aged 35, was admitted to a narcological hospital with pronounced symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. A C200 dilution of potentiated monoclonal antibodies to ethanol in a dose of 1 sublingual tablet every 15 minutes was prescribed. Within two hours of the therapy the patient's condition significantly improved: the tremor, hyperhydrosis, and weakness disappeared, the patient went to sleep. Twenty-four hours later he was discharged. Conclusion: potentiated antibodies to ethanol have a therapeutic effect in the case of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. EXAMPLE 46 Potentiated Antibodies to Antigens of Fetal and Primordial Tissues and Tissue Cultures A. Patient A. was a newborn baby 27 days old. He was born with symptoms of perinatal encephalopathy. As immunoenzyme diagnostic methods had revealed elevated levels of embryotropic neurospecific antigens in mother before this pregnancy, it was decided to administer to the baby a C200 dilution of a potentiated polyclonal antiserum to bovine fetal brain-specific non-species-specific protein (antigen), 14-3-2 (brain-specific enolase), in an oral dose of 5 drops of an aqueous solution to be administered 3 times a day. In the course of the treatment neurological symptoms subsided gradually; the reflexes of oral and spinal automatism restored and muscle hypertonus receded. The baby became calmer and started active breast sucking. A conclusion was drawn on the efficiency of potentiated antibodies to the said fetal antigen controlling normal morphogenesis of the central nervous system in the treatment of perinatal encephalopathy. B. Patient D., aged 4, with an established diagnosis of mental retardation had been receiving a C1000 dilution of monoclonal potentiated antibodies to primordial antigen nestin, a protein marker of neuron stem cells, in a dose of 5 drops of an aqueous solution once a day in the morning for six months with the purpose of enhancing the child's intellectual capacities. After six months of the treatment a neuropsychological examination showed that D's intellect and memory were up to the standard age level; the child's kindergarten tutor reported that the boy comprehended and learned the material well in class. C. Patient I., aged 8, with an established diagnosis of Down's syndrome had been receiving a C200 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to A-fetoprotein to be taken in a dose of 1 tablet a day for the first 12 months and in a dose of 1 tablet once in 3 days for subsequent 6 months. The neuropsychological examination by Bailey's method revealed a marked enhancement of the patient's intellect 1.5 years later. The patient's behavior is well ordered; he is adapted to being with other children. D. Patient S., aged 18, suffered from myasthenia of an unknown origin. In view of the inefficiency of conventional drugs the treatment was supplemented by the oral intake of a C30 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to the culture of neuronal stem cell of the tera-1 line enriched with the protein extract of the embryonic tissue in a dose of 1 ml 3 times a day for 6 months. The combined treatment resulted in an increased tolerance of physical strain, receded bulbar symptoms, diplopia, and ptosis, which made it possible to reduce the daily doses of corticosteroid drugs several times. E. Patient M., aged 42, suffered from the astheno-neurological syndrome accompanying the remote period of vernal encephalitis. As conventional therapy proved its inefficiency, it was decided to prescribe the oral intake of a C200 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to embryonic neocortex (the antiserum was obtained by immunization of rabbits with tissues from the occipital zone of the brain cortex of 15-day old embryos of Wistar line rats) in a dose of 1 ml twice a day, for 6 months. In the course of treatment the patient's asthenic symptoms became less pronounced, his ability to work was restored, though disseminated microsymptoms persisted in his neurological status. F. Patient K., aged 39, suffered from chronic alcoholism, grade II. He went to seek for narcologist's advice declaring his desire to start a sober life and asking for a new method of treatment because those he had already tried were of little effect. The prescription was: a regular intake of a C1000 dilution of polyclonal potentiated antibodies to homogenized hippocampi of embryos of Wistar line rats (hippocampi of several dozens of syngenic fetuses were used for immunization) in a dose of 1 tablet once a day. The remission had been lasting for 8 months, in the course of this period of medical observation no episodes of consuming alcoholic beverages have been registered, the patient states the absence of craving for alcohol. G. Patient A., aged 8, suffered from liver cirrhosis of an unknown etiology. As the conventional therapy had no significant effect, the oral intake of a C4 dilution of polyclonal potentiated antibodies to homogenized liver of the human fetus was prescribed in a dose of 1 ml 3 times a day. During four months of the therapy a clinical improvement of the patient's condition was observed, manifestations of general intoxication symptoms and liver failure subsided. The patient's emotional tone rose, the paleness of skin, the icteric hue of the scleras, and spider-like hemangiomas disappeared; the size of the liver diminished. A conclusion was drawn on high efficiency of this mode of treatment. EXAMPLE 47 Potentiated Antibodies to Tissues or Tissue Cultures A. Patient O., aged 8, suffers from a malignant course of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The intranasal administration of a C50 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to a culture of insular cells of the pancreas of newborn rabbits in a dose of 1 ml 3 times a day was prescribed with therapeutic purposes. After three months of the therapy the course of illness became stable, the blood glucose level went down, and the disposition to ketoacidosis receded. There were no comas or hypoglycemic episodes during the period of the treatment and the amount of insulin intake was reduced by 50%. B. Patient P., aged 35, suffered from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (mild course). As the patient was unwilling to take insulin, the recommendation was to start the oral intake of 1 ml of a C50 dilution of an aqueous solution of polyclonal potentiated antiserum to insular cells of the pancreas of a newborn calf once a day. As a result of the monotherapy with this preparation, the patient was feeling well. Her blood glucose level was within normal limits. The patient did not take insulin any more. C. Patient V. aged 56, suffered from obstructing atherosclerosis of coronary arteries and angina decubitus. In view the inefficiency of conventional therapy the prescription was to take intranasally a C30 dilution of potentiated polyclonal antibodies to the homogenized heart of a newborn rabbit in a dose of 3 drops of an aqueous solution 5 times a day. After six months of the therapy the intensity of pain was reduced, the patient had pain much more seldom and only after a sufficiently strong physical strain; his blood lipid formula became normal and the dose of nitrate drugs was reduced approximately by 50%. Thus, an analysis of the examples given above shows that the activated form of ultra-low doses of antibodies to an antigen (a substance or a pharmaceutical agent) does not produce the well-known immunological effect of binding the antigen and inhibiting its activity; on the contrary, it reproduces the antigen's activity in a modified form, which results in a partial or complete reduction of the pathological syndrome, in the regulation of whose mechanisms of development said antigen is involved. In this case such antigen-associated side effects as toxicity, addiction, and tolerance are absent. In addition, activated antibodies in ultra-low doses potentiate (reinforce) the effect of an antigen (a pharmaceutical agent) on their combined or simultaneous administration, which makes it possible to reduce the dose of the pharmaceutical agent and to minimize its side effects. The administration of activated forms of ultra-low doses of antibodies to a substance or a pharmaceutical agent favors the reduction of the intensity of the pathological syndromes (acute or chronic intoxication, post-intoxication disorders, dependence) caused by this substance or pharmaceutical agent. Experimental studies of activated forms of ultra-low doses of antibodies make it possible to determine their therapeutic properties even in situations where the biological activity of the initial antigen remains unknown. 1.
