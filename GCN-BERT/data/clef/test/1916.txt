Tmnroved Tortilla Toaster Background of the Invention [001] This non-provisional application draws priority from United States Provisional Application serial number 61/785,976 filed on 14 March 2013. [002] The tortilla is a basic food in Hispanic homes in the United States and around the world. Typically made of com or flour, the tortilla is served warm at every meal. Typically in the United States a tortilla is flat, round and six-inches in diameter. Conventionally, a tortilla is heated in a skillet on each side. Heating in a skillet, the surface of the tortilla in contact with the skillet is toasted and it acquires a bit of a skin. The tortilla is typically then flipped and the other side of the flat tortilla is warmed and it too acquires a bit of a skin. Typically, a family eats six to twelve tortillas at a meal. [003] Warming enough tortillas for a meal presents a problem. The skillet warming method requires a minimum of one minute per side. Only four tortillas can be warmed in a typical skillet. Some persons tasked with warming tortillas have tried to use the microwave oven to warm the tortilla but microwave cooking does not result in the desired consistency as the tortillas become too moist. Moreover, in the microwave a tortilla is warmed from the inside out. In the skillet, a tortilla is toasted from the outside with heat permeating the interior. [004] Inventor found a number of patents on devices to warm tortillas. Inventor reviewed the following patents: U.S. patent 7047871 to Christoffel U.S. patent 8069776 to Glucksman U.S. patent 6546844 to Trevino U.S. patent 5584231 to DeLeon U.S. patent 2562535 to Leonard U.S. patent 6205911 to Ochoa U.S. patent 5765471 to Monard U.S. patent 4976195 to Cavazos U.S. patent 7094991 to Naranjo U.S. patent 6116150 to Greenfield U.S. patent 5309826 to Ortiz None of these patents respond to problems in the inventive manner addressed by inventor. Summary of the Invention [005] The invention is an improved tortilla toaster able to be stationed on a tabletop and able to heat six standard six-inch tortillas in about 90-seconds and, with a barrel or drum pivot of the heating area, deliver the warm, toasted tortillas onto a plate or tray without risking a bum to the hands of the user. The improved tortilla toaster also reduces risks of shock or electrocution because, unlike a bread toaster with exposed electric wires where a person wielding a utensil might stick said utensil in a toaster and make contact with the electric wires, the improved tortilla toaster has no exposed electric wires. As discussed below, heat is provided by Nichrome wires wrapped around a mica board and that mica board is sandwiched between two other mica boards devoid of electric wires. [006] As shown in the accompanying drawings, the improved tortilla toaster is able to accept up to six six-inch com or flour tortillas. The improved tortilla toaster has a base with a left end cap and a right end cap. There is drum-shaped or half-barrel-shaped outer oven wall with a left pivot pin and a right pivot pin. The left pivot pin rests in a socket in the interior of the leg of the left end cap. The right pivot pin rests in a socket in the interior of the leg of the right end cap. Inside the outer oven is a drum-shaped or half -barrel-shaped inner oven wall. Mounted in the inner oven wall are seven heating modules. On the extreme left and right sides is a thermal brake to prevent heat melting either end cap. In the preferred embodiment, the end caps could be made of metal or plastic. For reasons of cost, the end caps would likely be formed of molded plastic. Each heating module is comprised of a mica heating plate wrapped with Nichrome wire with a mica thermal diffuser on either side of said heating plate with a steel cage guard on either side of said mica thermal diffuser and an assembly retainer that holds the above identified pieces together. All internal parts of the improved tortilla toaster are food grade products. The cage guards are food grade steel or stainless steel. AC power is from the wall (or any AC source of similar character to typical home AC power) and the cord enters the device in the base of the device. The cord connects in the right end cap to the DPST (“double pole single throw”) Contact installed on the right side outer enclosure plate. When the tortilla toaster is set so that the front and back sills are approximately parallel to the ground, then the DPST Contact on the right side outer enclosure plate makes contact with the DPST Contact mounted on thermal brake. AC Power is then distributed from the DPST Contact on the thermal brake to wires that carry power to the control board and the heating modules. [007] A user may adjust a knob connected to a variable resister or potentiometer on the control board through the outer oven enclosure to adjust the time of the heating and toasting of the tortilla toaster cycle. The forward and rearward edge of the half-barrel or drum is fitted with a combination manual rotation lever and switch. [008] The improved tortilla toaster would typically be set on a counter or table or shelf or dashboard or seat approximately parallel to the ground. When the improved tortilla toaster is in use, then the forward and rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch are approximately parallel to the table top. When the improved tortilla toaster is not in service, then the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch is lower than the rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch. In the preferred embodiment, the oven assembly is weighted so that the forward combination manual rotation lever rests about 30° forward. The forward combination manual rotation lever and switch and oven assembly can further barrelpivot or drum-pivot forward to release the hot tortillas. [009] The steps for using the improved tortilla toaster are as follows: 1. At its resting position, the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch will rest about 30° lower than the rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch; 2. The user will load the desired number of slots in the improved tortilla toaster with one or more tortillas (a user could elect to load tortillas after the unit has reached operating temperature without compromising effectiveness of the toasting operation); 3. The user will barrel-roll the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch and rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch until they are approximately parallel to one another thereby turning on the improved tortilla toaster; 4. The improved tortilla toaster will heat the tortillas in the heater for the time set on the adjustment knob; 5. At the end of the cycle, the oven enclosure assembly will rotate forward to to rest position; 6. The user may further rotate the oven enclosure assembly until the hot tortillas slide from the improved tortilla toaster; 7. When the user releases the forward and rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch, then the barrel will pivot back to the near parallel position where the oven enclosure assembly rests; 8. Repeat with one or more additional tortillas. Objects of the Invention [010] The objects of this improved tortilla toaster invention include but are not limited to: [011] To provide for tabletop or reasonable equivalent heating of multiple tortillas simultaneously; [012] To provide for rapid risk-free emptying of the improved tortilla toaster that takes advantage of the tortilla shape and gravity; [013] To provide for simultaneous heating on both sides of the a tortilla; [014] To provide even heating of tortillas; and, [015] To provide heating of tortillas without the risk of electrocution. Description of the Preferred Embodiment [016] The preferred embodiment of the improved tortilla toaster is shown in the accompanying figures. Essentially, the improved tortilla toaster provides for heating up to six tortillas at one time. Rather than heat the tortilla on one side at a time as a user would in a skillet, the improved tortilla toaster provides for toasting and heating of two sides at one time. Unlike a bread toaster that uses an exposed wire heater to toast, the improved tortilla toaster uses mica thermal diffusers to even out heat and spread the heat to optimize toasting and heating a tortilla. Moreover, the improved tortilla toaster is engineered to operate off of a standard 15 Amperes line available in most homes in the United States. Method of Operation [017] The improved tortilla toaster operates off of both temperature and time to achieve optimal doneness. The heart of the control circuit is an 8-bit microcontroller PIC 18F13K22 (in Fig. 8 called ‘NUNI CONTROLLER’) which is configured as follows: 1. Insert tortillas in the improved tortilla toaster 2. Rock the housing backward to activate the heating cycle 3. When toasting is complete, the heating process stops and the toaster housing is released forward slightly to its original position 4. Rotate the toaster housing to present the tortillas for retrieval. [018] The controller is predicated on both the toasting temperature, and, once the temperature is reached, the user can select time (what a user might term “done-ness”) by adjusting the adjustment knob. Neither time nor temperature alone are suitable to achieve consistent tortilla toasting. The block diagram is included as Fig. 8. [019] When the user closes the switch contacts (by rotating the outer oven enclosure so that the cage guards are up), the heating modules are connected to the AC as well as the microcontroller which turns on the electromagnet that holds the outer oven enclosure in place in the parallel to the surface position described earlier. The microcontroller signals to the user that the tortilla toaster is heating by blinking an LED just adjacent the knob. [020] The user may exercise a personal preference loading the tortillas in the tortilla toaster before starting the heating cycle or after the tortilla toaster has come to temperature without a loss in efficiency or effectiveness. [021] The control circuit’s temperature measurement element (a Negative Temperature Coefficient Thermistor) is mounted in the inner oven to measure the oven temperature. In the Thermistor, the resistance changes in response to the temperature in the toaster with its resistance dropping to a well characterized resistance vs. temperature curve as the temperature rises. [022] The microcontroller selected for the tortilla toaster includes A to D (Analog to Digital) converter that’s built into the microcontroller. The A to D converter allows the microcontroller to convert a small voltage (analog) produced by the Thermistor into a binary number (digital). The voltage the Thermistor produces is proportional to the temperature inside the tortilla toaster. Hence, the number that the A to D converter obtains by measuring the voltage produced by the Thermistor is a numeric representation of the tortilla toaster’s internal temperature. This number is used by the microcontroller’s logic to determine the readiness of the tortilla toaster to start the toasting cycle. The microcontroller samples the tortilla toaster’s internal temperature nearly continuously. During this heating phase, the tortilla toaster indicates that it is coming to toasting temperature but not yet there by blinking an LED adjacent to the adjustment knob. However, if the Inner Oven Enclosure is already at toasting temperature, the microcontroller will skip the coming to toasting temperature phase. Since the microcontroller continuously monitors the internal temperature of the Inner Oven Enclosure, the microcontroller will know if it can transition into the toasting cycle without a heating delay. [023] Once the microcontroller determines that the critical toasting temperature is reached (through experimentation inventor determined a starting or “factory-set” value of about 50°C (about 122°F)) the logic tells the program that the Inner Oven Enclosure is officially “HOT” and the toasting timing or duration, set by the knob mounted on the front of the Outer Oven Enclosure, begins and this is signaled by the LED illuminating continuously instead of blinking. [024] The toasting duration is selected viarotary code switch which has 16 separate positions. A switch with fewer positionsbe used. The position of the switch is communicated to the microcontroller via 4The toasting duration (timing) is adjustable from a range that goes from 15-seconds toper the below table. Sw Position Duration sec 35 20 25 4 30 5 35 6 40 7 1C 45 50 ■ 55 10 60 11 65 12 70 13 75 14 80 15 85 16 90 The darker cells show the variability if aswitch were used. [025] Once the timer is decremented tothe logic turns of the electromagnet that hold the DPST Switch Contacts closed and themodules are therefore extinguished. As a result of the loss of holding force, the Inner Ovenand Outer Oven Enclosures should rotate to its resting position (about 30° forward)due to where the concentration of mass is located on the Inner Oven Enclosure and OuterEnclosure. The “Time and Temperature” based approach will produce consistenttortilla toasting outcomes. [026] Optionally, inventor, due to a surplus of drive pins on the microcontroller, might include a beeper alarm for the end of the toasting cycle but the alarm can be left out without undermining operation of the microcontroller. [027] Aside from the microcontroller, the components include a thermistor for measuring temperature in the Inner Oven Enclosure, a rotary code switch for selecting toasting duration, a transistor-like semi-conductor for energizing the electromagnet, an LED to indicate state of the device, and, optimally, a beeper, and an AC power supply. [028] This control board connects to the AC line via the DPST Switch contacts that are part of the rotating mechanism, so the controller board itself does not carry the heavy load of the heaters. The heaters are connected in parallel to the DPST Switch contacts. There is one DPST Contact Assembly that sits in the Right-Hand end cap which connects to the line-cord and there is a second, opposing DPST Contact Assembly that is carried on the rotating oven assembly that connects to the heaters and to the control board. When the DPST contacts are open (not in contact) then the tortilla toaster is not toasting. When the DPST contacts are closed, then the tortilla toaster is toasting. The only connection that the controller board makes (aside from connecting to the AC line) is to the electromagnet which holds the DPST Switch contacts closed during the toasting cycle. So the DPST Switch Contacts carry the complete load of the heaters and completely disconnects the toaster from the AC power when toasting is complete without even the controller connected to the AC line so that the tortilla toaster draws no electricity when it is not on. [029] The following sections more precisely disclose assembly and operation of the improved tortilla toaster.

When both the threshold temperature equals the factory set value and the toaster time equals the user-set values are “True” then the controller releases the electromagnet and the disconnects the AC power.

[048] Fig. 18 is an exploded view of the improved tortilla toaster comprised of the left exterior end cap, the left interior end cap, left outer oven enclosure plate, the left thermal brake, the oven assembly with its heating modules in place, right outer oven enclosure plate, the right thermal brake, the right interior end cap, and the right exterior end cap. Detailed Description of the Drawings [049] The improved tortilla toaster 100, as shown in Fig. 1, is comprised of a left end cap unit 120 and a right end cap unit 140 which are formed with a flat bottom edge for resting on a flat surface such as a tabletop. As shown in Fig. 18, the left end cap is comprised of three pieces: left outer end cap 123, left inner end cap 124 and a left outer oven enclosure plate 125. Left outer end cap 123 and left inner end cap 124 are joined with molded clips or other attachment means. The left outer oven enclosure plate 125 fits in a recess in left inner end cap 124. The left outer enclosure plate 125 has a plurality of tabs 126. The left outer enclosure plate 125 has a hole in the approximate center of said plate. As shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 7a, and Fig. 17, the oven is comprised of left and right thermal brakes 170a, 170b which to which are secured with securing means a left pivot rod 350 and a right pivot rod 355 and an oven assembly 600. As shown in Fig. 7a, left inside end cap 120 has a left socket 530. The left pivot rod 350 is seated through said left outer enclosure plate 125 and into left socket 530. As shown in Fig. 18, the right outer enclosure plate 127 fits in a recess in right inner end cap 135. The right outer enclosure plate 127 has a plurality of tabs 128. The right outer enclosure plate 127 has a hole in the approximate center of said plate. As shown in Figure 7a, right end cap unit 140 has a right socket 535. The right pivot rod 355 is seated through said hole in said right outer enclosure plate 127 and into right socket 535. On both the left side and right side, the outer enclosure plates 125 and 127 have holes large enough to allow the left and right pivot rods 350, 355 to protrude through the plates without binding on them. [050] As shown in Fig. 17, the oven 600 is comprised of two barrel-like or drum-like structures, an outer oven enclosure 160 and an inner oven enclosure 360. The inner oven enclosure 360 nests within the outer oven enclosure 160. The outer oven enclosure 160 on the left side is secured to bracket 550 with rivets or other securing means. The left side of outer oven enclosure 160 with bracket 550 is secured to left outer oven enclosure plate 125 using a plurality of tabs 126. The outer oven enclosure 160 on the right side is secured to bracket 555 with rivets or other securing means. The right side of the outer oven enclosure 160 with bracket 555 is secured to the right outer oven enclosure plate 127 using a plurality of tabs 128. [051 ] At the heart of the improved tortilla toaster are heating modules as shown assembled in Fig. 4 and in exploded view in Fig. 5. Fig. 13 provides information on dimensions within the heating module. Fig. 7a shows the seven heating modules in the preferred embodiment of the invention. As you will read below, there are one-sided and two-sided heating modules. Of the seven heating modules, the first and seventh heating modules are one-sided heating modules since outer heating modules only have potential contact with a tortilla on one side. Heating modules in the middle five positions have potential contact with a tortilla on both sides of the modules. [052] A two-sided heating module 245, as shown in Fig. 5, is comprised of a left side cage guard 180, a first mica thermal diffuser 310, a mica board 330 wrapped with Nichrome ribbons 320, a second mica thermal diffuser 310, a right side cage guard 180 and the entire heating module 245 is held together with assembly retainer 250. A one-sided heating module 240 is the same as a two-sided heating module 245 except that the Nichrome ribbons are only present on one side of the mica board 330. The paddle-shaped mica board 330 is notched with a plurality of notches 342. As shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, mica board 330 has connection tab 300. Connection tab 300 has wire lay notches 270. Nichrome lead wire 290 feeds the Nichrome ribbons 320 that are wound around mica board 330 ending in wire lay notch 270 and wire loop Nichrome terminal 280. On either side of mica board 330 is mica thermal diffuser 310. The heating module of cage guard 180, mica thermal diffuser 310, mica board 330, mica thermal diffuser 310, cage guard 180 are held together with assembly retainer 250. As shown in Figs. 7a and 17, the improved tortilla toaster makes use of five two-sided heating modules 245 and two one-sided heating modules 240. [053] The inner oven enclosure 360, as shown in Fig. 17, is fabricated with seven regularly spaced bottom slots 565 and seven regularly spaced forward and rearward side slots 575. The left side thermal brake 170a is secured with rivets or other securing means and bracket 550 to the left edge of the inner oven enclosure 360. As shown in Figs. 7a and 17, a one-sided heating module 240 (active side facing to right side) is installed in the extreme left slot 565 such that connection tab 300 protrudes through the bottom of inner oven enclosure 360. Five two-sided heating modules 245 are installed in the center five bottom slots such that connection tab 300 protrudes through the bottom of inner oven enclosure 360. As shown in Figs. 7a and 17, a one-sided heating module 240 (active side facing to left side) is installed in the extreme right slot 565 such that connection tab 300 protrudes through the bottom of inner oven enclosure 360. The right side thermal brake 170b is secured to with rivets or other securing means and bracket 555 to the right edge of the inner oven enclosure 360. As shown in Figs. 7a and 17, an AC power cord comes from an electric source into the right end cap 137 and connects to the DPST Contact 650b mounted Right Plate 127. The DPST Contact 650a is mounted on the right thermal brake 170b. Wire leads run from the DPST Contact 650a to the one sided heating module 240 adjacent the right thermal brake 170b and connects at the wire lay notch 270. Another set of wire leads run from the wire lay notch 270 to the control board 380. The heating modules are powered with wires that run pier to pier from one heating module to the next connected at the wire lay notches 270 on each heating module 240, 245. Another set of wire leads run from the control board 380 to electromagnet 660 mounted on the thermal brake 170b. [054] As shown in Fig. 17, the inner oven assembly 585 is secured in the outer oven enclosure 160 using the left bracket 550 and right bracket 555. The retention tab 230 as shown in Figure 4 on each assembly retainer 250 on each heating module 240, 245 is locked into place by the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch 110 which is secured to the brackets 550, 555 and front edge of outer oven enclosure 160 with securing means and the rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch 220 which is also secured to the brackets 550, 555 and the rear edge of the outer oven enclosure 160. Six finger guards 130 are secured in the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch 110 and rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch 220. [055] As shown in Figs. 7, 17, and 18, the outer oven assembly 595 is mounted in the left end cap unit 120 and right end cap unit 140 by the left pivot rod 350 on the left thermal brake 170a nesting through the left outer oven enclosure plate 125 into the left socket 530 and the right pivot rod 355 on the right thermal brake 170b nesting through the right outer oven enclosure plate 127 into the right socket 535. Left and right torsion springs 540, 545 are installed on left and right pivot rods 530, 535 to control the rolling of the oven assembly 600. [056] The improved tortilla toaster, as shown in Fig. 13, is specifically configured. The thickness, Th, of the two mica thermal diffusers 310 along with the mica heating plate 330 is about 0.0785 inches. By experimentation, the inventor determined that the optimal distance from the outside of each mica thermal diffuser 310 to the cage guard 180, Ow, is about 0.100 inch. By experimentation inventor determined that the loading zone 190 between two opposing cage guards 180, Wsi0t, is about 0.435 inch. The distance from heating center of one mica heating plate 330 to the adjacent center of mica heating plate (known as the “Pitch”), Phh, is derived to be about 0.800 inch. The diameter of the hot zone, Dhz, was established by experimentation to be about 5.5 inches. The diameter of the mica heater assembly, DHtr, was established by experimentation to be about 6.0 inches. The diameter of the cage guard 180 (here called by the alternate name “wire cloth”) was determined by experiment to be about 6.5 inches. [057] The controls in the improved tortilla toaster are shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 7b, 8, 9a, 9b 14, 15, 17, and 18. Figs. 1, 2, 3, 7b, 8, 14, 15, 17, and 18 show the adjustment knob 150 mounted on the front of the outer oven enclosure 160. The knob 150 connects through the outer oven enclosure and attaches to the control board 380. The control board 380 is mounted on the inside of the outer oven enclosure 160 although the knob 150 includes a LED indicator light above it. On the wire diagram Figure 9b, the adjustment knob 150 connects to the Duration Rotary Switch on the control board 380. The Duration Rotary Switch has either 10 or 16 positions. The control board 380 is connected to a thermistor 625 that protrudes into or has access through an aperture to the inner oven 360 to measure the temperature in the inner oven 360. [058] The improved tortilla toaster is turned on by rotating the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch 110 or the rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch 220 so that they are about parallel to the table top on the improved tortilla toaster is resting. That rotation brings into contact DPST contacts 650a and 650b (connecting the improved tortilla toaster to AC line power) and moves the bent tab 400 to a position in contact with electromagnet 660. Connected to AC line power, the microcontroller marked PIC 18F13Κ22 on wire diagram Figure 9a, starts the heating process of the heating modules 240, 245. The electromagnet 660 when energized and bent tab 400 keep the improved tortilla toaster in the operating position with the front combination manual rotation lever and switch 110 and rear combination manual rotation lever and switch 220 approximately parallel to the ground or surface on which the improved tortilla toaster. Figure 9a is the toaster control electronics for the improved tortilla toaster. Figure 9b is the circuitry diagram for the improved tortilla toaster. The power lead 370 connects to the control board 380. [059] Fig. 11 shows the steps of using the improved tortilla toaster. Fig. 11a shows the improved tortilla toaster in its resting position where the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch 110 is rotated a bit and down such that the rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch 220 is a bit up. At this point, the user would load tortillas in the improved tortilla toaster. Fig. lib shows that by rotating the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch 110 or the rearward combination manual rotation lever or switch 220 so that they are parallel to the table top, the improved tortilla toaster engages and heats. Fig. lie shows how at the end of the time cycle (when the electromagnet 660 releases the bent tab 400 and the oven assembly pivots forward and right and left pivot rods 350, 355 cause the oven assembly 600 to rotate to its rest position) releases the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch 110 and rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch 220 would once again return to a rest position. In figure lid, the user may rotate the oven assembly by pressing down the forward combination manual rotation lever and switch 110 or by pulling over the rearward combination manual rotation lever and switch 220 for the heated tortillas to slide from the improved tortilla toaster. After removing the tortillas and with or without assistance from the user the oven assembly 600 would rotate back to its rest position (as shown in figure 1 la) as it is weighted to have a resting position of approximately 30° forward.
