The present invention relates to an improved and industriallyadvantageous process for the preparation of imatinib of formula I, FORMULA I or its mesylate salt of formula Ia, FORMULA la .CHaSO 3 H O H 3 with controlled level of genotoxic impurities. Further present invention relates to an efficient and reproducible process for the preparation of 0t-form of imatinib mesylate. BACKGOUND OF THE INVENTION Imatinib of formula I, functions as specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes and is chemically known as N-{5-[4-(4-methyl-piperazinomethyl)- benzoylamido]-2-methyiphenyl}-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine-amine. N. N H FORMULA I HN. O H It is indicated for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemia, for patients in chronic phase and in blast crisis, accelerated phase and also for malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. It selectively inhibits activation of target proteins involved in cellular proliferation. Imatinib also has potential for the treatment of other cancers that express these kinases, including acute lymphocytic leukemia and certain solid tumors. Imatinib is sold in U.S. by Novartis as Gleevec tablet containing imatinib mesylate equivalent to or 400 mg of imatinib free base. lmatinib and other related compounds were first disclosed in US patent 5,521,184, wherein imatinib is prepared by involving amine intermediate of formula II, as shown below in scheme: N., N 0 N N H HN, HN, Pyridine O H 3 C H 3 C Formula !I Imatinib is prepared by stirring a solution of amine intermediate of formula II with 1.14 meq (mol equivalent) of 4-(4-methylpiperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride in pyridine at room temperature for 23 hours to give crude product which is further slurried in dichloromethane/methanol and separated by column chromatography. In our hands, we have found that crude product prepared by the above process; contain approximately 17 to 18 % amine intermediate of formula I1 as an impurity which on chromatographic separation reduced to 0.08 % (800 ppm). Use of column chromatography makes the process not suitable to employ for industrial synthesis being time consuming and tedious process. Even after performing tedious and time consuming chromatographic separation, amine intermediate of formula II which bears structural alerts, and is positive in several genotoxicity system still remain in the product up to 800 ppm as an impurity, which is unacceptable from regulatory requirements for genotoxic impurities. Presence of amine intermediate of formula II as an impurity in the final product i.e. imatinib mesylate also yielded toxicological findings (hyperplasia, necrosis) in various organs in a 4-week study in rats. Such genotoxic compounds are believed to have potential to exert non-reversible changes in genetic material. According to regulatory authorities, such as FDA, EU authorities, and in guidelines issued by ICH (The International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use), a drug manufacturer must submit data demonstrating that the product intended for marketing complies with regulations with regard to the content of impurities. The content of an unidentified impurity cannot exceed 0.1% (1000 ppm) by weight, while the amount of a known impurity cannot exceed 0.15% (1500 ppm). The drug manufacturer usually submits analytical data to the regulatory authority demonstrating that content of each impurity is in accordance with regulations. The regulatory authority checks the submitted data in order to ensure that the drug is having acceptable amount of impurities and is suitable for marketing. But this level of0.1% (1000 ppm) or 0.15 % (1500 ppm) may be even unacceptably high for an impurity if it is genotoxic. According to a study carried out by Novartis, limit for this amine intermediate of formula II as an impurity in the final product can be 20 ppm based on technical feasibility. Further analysis results carried out on Gleevec tablet for quantification of amine intermediate shows its presence as 2-3 ppm. The control of impurities bearing a genotoxic potential in pharmaceutical products has received more and more attention over the past years. As genotoxic impurities are considered to be harmful for the patient administrating the drug like imatinib mesylate, so these should be controlled at minimum possible level. Therefore synthetic process should be capable of producing imatinib mesylate with low amount of amine intermediate of formula II as an impurity. There are several known processes reported for the preparation of imatinib and its mesylate salt but are either silent about the level of amine intermediate as an impurity in imatinib or yields the product with unacceptable amount of impurity. US patent 7,507,821 discloses preparation of imatinib by stirring a mixture of amine intermediate of formula II with 1.23 mole equivalent of 4-(4-methylpiperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride in pyridine at 50 °C for 4.5 hours to give imatinib which is slurried one or more times in ethyl acetate to yield imatinib of 97 % purity. Use of pyridine makes the process disadvantageous as it is difficult to remove residual traces from final product. US patent 7,550,591 discloses a process for preparation of imatinib by stirring amine intermediate of formula II and 1.11 mole equivalent (meq) of 4-(4-methylpiperazino methyl)benzoic acid in tetrahydrofuran and water for 20 minutes followed by addition of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyllaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and then further stirring for one hour to give imatinib which is then purified to give product having amine intermediate 0.01% (100 ppm). Presence of unacceptable amount of the genotoxic impurity i.e. amine intermediate of formula II makes the process not amenable for regulatory market. US patent 7,638,627 discloses a process for preparation of imatinib by suspending amine intermediate of formula II in dimethylformamide followed by addition of 1.28 meq of 4-(4-methylpiperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride dihydrochloride and heating at 70 °C for 15 hours to give imatinib trihydrochloride monohydrate followed by basification with aqueous ammonia to give imatinib. Process involves an extra step of generation of trihydrochloride salt and then its neutralization to give imatinib free base. US patent application 2008/0103305 discloses preparation of imatinib by adding 1.1 meq of 4-(4-methylpiperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride dihydrochloride to a solution of amine intermediate of formula II in pyridine followed by stirring at 15-20 °C for 1 hour and heating to 40 °C to give imatinib of purity more than 98 %. Use of pyridine makes the process disadvantageous as it is difficult to remove residual traces from final product and process silent about the presence or absence of genotoxic impurity. PCT publication WO 2008/24829 discloses preparation of imatinib by condensation of amine intermediate of formula II with 1.11 mole equivalent of 4-(4methylpiperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride dihydrochloride in the presence of anhydrous pyridine at 20 °C for 18 hours to give imatinib which was further purified with silica gel chromatography. PCT publication WO 2008/0117298 discloses preparation of imatinib by the reaction of amine intermediate of formula II with 1.22 meq of 4-(4-methylpiperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride dihydrochloride in the presence of base to form imatinib which is then washed with isopropanol, suspended in water followed by extraction with chloroform, distillation and treatment of residue with ethyl acetate give imatinib. PCT publication WO 2008/136010 discloses a process for the preparation of imatinib by reaction of amine intermediate of formula II with 0.57 meq of 4-(4methylpiperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride in chloroform and potassium hydroxide at 25-35 °C for 4 hours to give imatinib. Most of the prior art processes are silent about amount of genotoxic impurity i.e. amine intermediate of formula II in final product. It is observed that when amine intermediate of formula II is reacted with 4-(4-methylpiperazino methyl)benzoic acid or reactive derivatives or their salts with molar ratio of amine intermediate to benzoic acid or its derivative in the range of 1:1 to 1: 1.30, it finally results in imatinib mesylate having genotoxic amine intermediate of formula II more than 100 ppm, which is not acceptable. In addition to concern of genotoxic impurity, prior art processes for the synthesis of a-form of imatinib mesylate does not produce reproducible results. US patent 6,894,051 ('051) discloses preparation of imatinib mesylate in two crystalline forms such as a-crystal form and 13-crystal form. US '051 patent describes a-crystal form of imatinib mesylate characterized by needle shaped crystals and hygroscopic nature, which make it unsuitable for pharmaceutical formulation as solid dosage forms. Patent discloses a process for preparing the a-crystal form wherein imatinib base was suspended in ethanol; methane sulfonic acid was added and heated under reflux for 20 minutes and than filtered at 65°C. The filtrate was evaporated down to 50% and the residue filtered off at 25°C. The mother liquor was evaporated to dryness. Both residues were suspended in ethanol and dissolved under reflux with addition of water, cooling overnight to 25 °C, "filtration and drying yielded imatinib mesylate a form. The above mentioned process does not give reproducible results due to its cumbersome nature and always results in mixture of forms a and 13 form. Various other references like US patent 7732601, US patent application nos. 2006/0223816, 2007/0265288, 2008/0255138, 2008/0090833; PCT publication nos. 2006/048890, 2009/151899; an Indian application no. 216/KOLNP/2009 etc. discloses process for the preparation of a-form of imatinib mesylate. It has been noticed that polymorphic a form of imatinib mesylate when prepared as per the process reported in the prior art is not isolated in pure form it is contaminated with other forms such as 13 form or found to have residual solvent in unacceptable amounts. Further prior art processes are associated with one or more disadvantages such as use of pyridine, chromatographic techniques, low purity of imatinib, inconsistency in yielding a-form. In view of the above, there exists a need for an improved process for preparing imatinib mesylate which yields the product containing acceptable levels of genotoxic impurity, i.e., less than 20 ppm, as required by the regulatory authorities. There is also a need to develop an a reproducible and improved process wherein a form of imatinib mesylate is isolated consistently in pure form without contamination of other forms and have residual solvents in specified limits. Therefore, present invention fulfill the need in the art and provides a process for preparation of imatinib or its mesylate salt that circumvent disadvantages associated with prior art, proved to be advantageous from industrial point of view and also fulfill purity criteria's led by various regulatory authorities. Present invention also provides an efficient and reproducible process for the preparation of t-form of imatinib mesylate using new solvent system.

Reaction completion can be monitored by suitable chromatographic techniques such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and the like. Atter completion of reaction, imatinib can be isolated from reaction mixture by using a suitable technique known in the art. Preferably, imatinib can be isolated from reaction mixture after employing acid base treatment to the reaction mass. Reaction mass can be acidified with a suitable acid selected from hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, formic acid and the like followed by layer separation. Resulting aqueous layer can be washed with a suitable solvent selected from halogenated solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform and the like. Aqueous layer is then diluted with a suitable solvent selected from ether such as tetrahydrofuran; nitrile such as acetonitrile; ketone such as acetone; C1. 3 alcohol and the like or mixture thereof followed by basification with a suitable base to precipitate the desired compound.

Imatinib thus isolated can be optionally washed with an aqueous solution of suitable base and/or water. The order and manner of combining the reactants at any stage of the process are not important and may be varied. The reactants may be added to the reaction mixture as solids, or may be dissolved individually and combined as solutions. Further, any of the reactants may be dissolved together, or their solutions may be combined in any order. Amine intermediate of formula II can be added to intermediate of formula III or they can be added in reverse order or alternatively can be combined together. Mode of addition does not make any impaot on the yield and purity of the product. Preferably, amine intermediate of formula II can be added to a solution of intermediate of formula Ill in a suitable base and solvent to form imatinib. Intermediate of formula IIl can be first treated with a suitable base in a suitable solvent at a temperature of 10 to 40 °C for 0.5 to 2 hours, prior to the reaction with amine intermediate of formula II.

The solid product can be recovered by suitable techniques such as decantation, filtration by gravity or by suction, centrifugation and the like. Imatinib, prepared by the above process, is found to be highly pure and contain amine intermediate of formula II less than 50 ppm, preferably less than 30 ppm, more preferably 10 ppm. It is found by present inventor that using intermediate of formula III in amount more than 1.5 meq as compared to amine intermediate of formula II reduce level of amine intermediate in the final product. In order to satisfy the requirements of various regulatory bodies for minimal impurities in an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), it is important to synthesize imatinib using a process that minimizes the amount of impurities including genotoxic impurity, produced during the various synthetic steps. During optimization of the process, it has been found that molar ratio of the reactant is very critical reaction variable for obtaining the imatinib with acceptable level of genotoxic impurity i.e. amine intermediate of formula II, which is difficult to remove once it remain in imatinib. Imatinib free base may be converted to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of imatinib by methods already known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable acids used for the salt formation includes inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid; organic acid includes acetic acid, tartaric acid, formic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, methansulfonic acid and the like. Preferably, imatinib mesylate is prepared. Imatinib can be converted to imatinib mesylate by any method known in the art or by the method as described herein, lmatinib having less than 50 ppm of amine intermediate of formula II yield imatinib mesylate having less than 20 ppm of amine intermediate, preferably less than 5 ppm; more preferablyl.6 ppm.

According to another embodiment, present invention provides an efficient and reproducible process for the preparation of or-form of imatinib mesylate. Generally, process involves treatment of imatinib in dimethylsulfoxide with methanesulfonic acid at a temperature of 5 to 80 °C for few minutes to few hours, preferably 25 to 30 °C for 5 minutes to 1 hour.

The reaction mixture can optionally be filtered to remove any insoluble particulate present in the reaction mixture, when reaction mixture is completely soluble dimethylsulfoxide. Reaction mixture can be optionally cooled to 5 °C to ambient temperature. Methanesulfonic acid used for the reaction can be used as such or in solution with dimethylsulfoxide. Thereafter, a second solvent can be added to the resulting mixture with optional seeding. Second solvent can be selected from the group consisting of alcohol such as 2-propanol, l-propanol, butanol; ester such as ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, propyl acetate; ketone such as acetone, methylisobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone; aliphatic hydrocarbon such as n-heptane, cyclohexane; halogenated solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform; ether such as tetrahydrofuran, isopropyl ether; nitrile such as acetonitrile; aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide and the mixture thereof. Second solvent can be used as a single solvent or mixture of two or more in any proportion. Reaction mixture can be optionally seeded with a-crystalline form of imatinib mesylate. The seeding compound can be added after the addition of second solvent to the resulting mixture or it can be added prior to addition of second solvent to reaction mixture. In another alternate way, a mixture of second solvent with seeding compound can be prepared by mixing second solvent with seeding compound with optional stirring and then added to the reaction mixture. In another way, seeding compound and second solvent can be added simultaneously to the reaction mixture. As the order of adding second solvent and seeding compound does not have any impact on the quality as well as quantity of the resulting a-crystalline form of imatinib mesylate, so it can be added in any order or in mixture. After the addition of second solvent with optional seeding, reaction mixture can be stirred for few minutes to few hours at a temperature of 20 to 60 °C, preferably for to 55 °C. More preferably mixture can be stirred till the complete precipitation of the a-crystalline form of imatinib mesylate take place. Mixture can be optionally cooled to a temperature of 15 to ambient temperature and further stirred till for 1 to 15 hours, preferably 2 to 8 hours. The resulting product can be isolated from the reaction mixture by suitable techniques such as filtration, centrifugation or decantation and the like. t-Crystalline form of imatinib mesylate thus obtained can be optionally washed with a suitable solvent selected from the solvents as used for the process. Imatinib mesylate, prepared by the using the imatinib synthesized by the process of present invention, is found to be highly pure and contain amine intermediate of formula II less than 20 ppm, preferably less than 10 ppm, more preferably 1.6 ppm. lmatinib mesylate is having purity more than 99 % by HPLC, preferably 99.5 % by HPLC. The starting material amine intermediate of formula II can be procured from the commercial sources or can be prepared by the methods already known in the art. Similarly, intermediate of formula IlI can be procured from the commercial sources or can be prepared by the methods already known in the art or can be prepared by the method as described herein for the reference. Intermediate of formula Ill (wherein X is as defined above provided X is not -OH group) can be prepared by the activation of corresponding dihydrochloride salt of acid intermediate. Generally, process involves the reaction of acid intermediate of formula III (wherein in X is -OH) with a suitable activating agent at a temperature of 20 to 80 °C for 2 to hours.

Reaction can be carried out in a suitable solvent for providing reaction media and can be selected from aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene; halogenated" solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform and the like. Reaction can be advantageously carried out using a catatalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide when activating reagent used is thionyl halide. Atter the completion of reaction, desired intermediate can be isolated from the reaction mixture or can be used in situ for the further reaction. Intermediate of formula III (wherein X is as defined above provided X is not -OH group) can be isolated by employing suitable techniques such as filtration, centrifugation or decantation and the like. Major advantages of the present invention lie in high purity of imatinib and as well as of imatinib mesylate with minimum level of genotoxic amine intermediate. Another advantage of the present invention is that it provides a process for the preparation of imatinib mesylate having controlled level of amine intermediate, preferably less than ppm, more preferably less than 5 ppm. The present invention also avoids the formation of genotoxic impurities during the synthesis of imatinib in order to circumvent its carry forward to imatinib mesylate. Still another advantage of present invention is to provide an efficient and reproducible process for the preparation of aform of imatinib mesylate. Also the product obtained is having acceptable limits of residual solvent, a-form of imatinib mesylate of the present invention has 2% or less of other polymorphic forms of imatinib mesylate.
