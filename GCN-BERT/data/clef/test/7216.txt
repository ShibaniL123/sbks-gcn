Example 34
4-({[3-Methyl-2-phenyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)quinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
14 mg (0.028 mmol) of the compound from Example 75A were dissolved in 3.5 ml of a THF/methanol mixture (5:1), 0.028 ml (0.14 mmol) of a 5 M lithium hydroxide solution were added and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 1 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was adjusted to pH 1-2 by addition of 4 M hydrochloric acid and purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 9 mg (63% of theory, purity 95%) of the title compound
