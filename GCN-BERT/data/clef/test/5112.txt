Step 3
The compound 9 (7.5 g, 27.7 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (90 mL). NBS (5.18 g, 29.1 mmol) was added to the solution at -10°C. The mixture was stirred at - 10°C for 30 minutes. Water was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water and brine. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give the mixture 10 (5:1 mixture of the compound 10-a and the compound 10-b) (3.68 g, yield 62%).
