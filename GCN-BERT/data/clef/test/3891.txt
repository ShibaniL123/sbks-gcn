Step 5. 5-(2-Fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)-3-iodo-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine
NaH in mineral oil (95 mg, 2.4 mmol) was slowly added at 0° C. to a solution of 5-(2-fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)-3-iodo-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (0.80 g, 2.2 mmol) and [β-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl chloride (0.42 mL, 2.4 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL). After stirring at r.t. for 1 h, the reaction mixture was quenched with water, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (650 mg, 59%).
