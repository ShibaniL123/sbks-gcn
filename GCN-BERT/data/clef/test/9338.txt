Example 34
Synthesis of 6-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)-1-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one hydrochloride
To a 10-mL test tube, 6-((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-2,3,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-1H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indole-3-carbonyl)-1-methylpyridin-2(1H)-one (33 mg, 67 µmol) synthesized in Example 10, and ethyl acetate were added. The resulting mixture was extracted with 1 N hydrochloric acid, and the aqueous layer was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was dried at 60°C for 2 hours under reduced pressure to obtain the title compound (33 mg, 94%) as weakly brown amorphous substance.
