1,9-Dimethylphenothiazine (1,9-DMePT)
This compound was synthesized following a slightly modified version of a reported procedure.19 To an oven-dried pressure tube cooled under Na, bis(o-tolyl)amine (2.70 g, 13.7 mmol), sulfur (1.09 g, 34.2 mmol), iodine (0.0510 g, 0.402 mmol), and ODCB (2 mL) were added. The pressure tube was sealed with a Teflon cap, and the reaction mixture was immersed in an oil bath heated to 180Â° C. for 8 h. After removing the reaction flask from the oil bath, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. It was then diluted with ethyl acetate and water, and the precipitate was removed via filtration. The organic layer was separated from the aqueous layer and washed with brine. The organic layer was then dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The resulting crude material was purified by column chromatography over neutral alumina using a gradient of hexanes and ethyl acetate to elute the product, which was crystallized from ethanol (0.81 g, 26%).
