Botanical designation: Pelargonium peltatum. Cultivar denomination: ‘FIPELDANBURG’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Pelargonium plant, botanically known as Pelargonium peltatum, commonly referred to as Ivy Geranium, and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘Fipeldanburg’. The new Pelargonium plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in De Lier, The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program is to create new freely-branching and freely-flowering Pelargonium plants with large flowers and attractive leaf and flower coloration. The new Pelargonium plant originated from a cross-pollination made by the Inventor in September, 2006 in De Lier, The Netherlands of a proprietary selection of Pelargonium peltatum identified as code number 60011, not patented, as the female, or seed, parent with a proprietary selection of Pelargonium peltatum identified as code number 88873, not patented, as the male, or pollen, parent. The new Pelargonium plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within the progeny of the stated cross-pollination in a controlled greenhouse environment in De Lier, The Netherlands in March, 2007. Asexual reproduction of the new Pelargonium plant by vegetative terminal cuttings in a controlled greenhouse environment in De Lier, The Netherlands since July, 2007 has shown that the unique features of this new Pelargonium plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of the new Pelargonium have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environmental conditions such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘Fipeldanburg’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Fipeldanburg’ as a new and distinct Pelargonium plant: 1. Upright to outwardly spreading and uniformly mounding plant habit.2. Freely basal branching habit.3. Early and freely flowering habit.4. Semi-double burgundy-colored flowers.5. Good garden performance. Plants of the new Pelargonium differ primarily from plants of the female parent selection in flower color as plants of the female parent selection have pink-colored flowers. Plants of the new Pelargonium differ primarily from plants of the male parent selection in flower form as flowers plants of the male parent selection are single types with five petals. Plants of the new Pelargonium can be compared to plants of Pelargonium peltatum ‘Global Merlot’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 11,733. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in De Lier, The Netherlands, plants of the new Pelargonium differed primarily from plants of ‘Global Merlot’ in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Pelargonium had larger leaves than plants of ‘Global Merlot’.2. Flower umbels of plants of the new Pelargonium were denser than and not as open as flower umbels of plants of ‘Global Merlot’.3. Flowers of plants of the new Pelargonium were slightly darker in color than flowers of plants of ‘Global Merlot’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying colored photograph illustrates the overall appearance of the new Pelargonium plant showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photograph may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Pelargonium plant. The photograph comprises a side perspective view of a typical flowering plant of ‘Fipeldanburg’ grown in a container. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The aforementioned photograph and following observations, measurements and values describe plants grown during the summer in 10.5-cm containers in a glass-covered greenhouse in De Lier, The Netherlands and under cultural practices typical of commercial Pelargonium production. During the production of the plants, day temperatures ranged from 16° C. to 28° C. and night temperatures ranged from 14° C. to 18° C. Plants were ten weeks old when the photograph was taken and 20 weeks old when the description was taken. In the detailed description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 2007 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
