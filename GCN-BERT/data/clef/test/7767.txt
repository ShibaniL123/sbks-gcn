[Step 2] Synthesis of tert-butyl 3-((2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)(3-fluorophenyl) carbamoyl)azetidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 3-((2-fluoro-4-(methoxycarbonyl)benzyl)(3-fluorophenyl)carbamoyl)azetidine-1-carboxylate (0.700 g, 1.520 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and hydrazine monohydrate (1.475 mL, 30.403 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (50 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 12 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, and water was added to the concentrate, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (0.600 g, 85.7 %) as white solid.
