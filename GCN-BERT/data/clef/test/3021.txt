The next step involves the synthesis of 4-(5-bromo-4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5-chlorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. 5-chloro-4-(4-(2-octyldodecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole 7 (2.09 g, 3.396 mmol) was added to a 100 mL Schlenk flask followed by 50 mL of anhydrous THF. The solution was cooled to 0Â° C. before N-bromosuccinimide (1.269 g, 7.132 mmol) was added in portions. The reaction was stirred overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding saturated potassium carbonate solution and then extracted with hexane. The combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After the removal of solvent, the resulting mixture was subjected to column purification with hexane as the eluent. Red crystal (1.91 g, 72.7%) was obtained as product after recrystallization in isopropanol and drying under vacuum.
