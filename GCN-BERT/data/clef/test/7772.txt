TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to the technical field of biological medicine, and particularly to a method for inducing bacteria to enter into a viable but nonculturable state. BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY In a hostile environment, many bacteria will enter into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. This state is a dormant form of non-sporulating bacteria, and may improve the survival of bacteria in a hostile environment. Currently, over 60 species of bacteria are known to be capable of entering into the VBNC state, most of which are pathogenic bacteria. The bacteria in the VBNC state still have metabolic activities, while cannot grow or form bacterial colonies on non-selective media commonly used for the bacteria. Therefore, conventional methods for bacteria detection, such as plate counting method, cannot detect the presence of bacteria in the VBNC state. As such, it is probably to underestimate the number of bacteria in a sample detected, bringing potential security risks to people. Therefore, conducting researches on the characteristic and formation mechanism of the bacteria in VBNC state is vitally important for effectively killing them. However, it takes a long time to obtain the bacteria in VBNC state, which thus limits the study progress thereof. At present, the methods for inducing bacteria to enter into a viable but nonculturable state are primarily the method of oligotrophy combined with low temperatures. However, this method needs a long time for inducing, typically more than one month, thereby restricting the research progress of the bacteria in the VBNC state. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention aims at providing a method for inducing bacteria to enter into a viable but nonculturable state. The present invention provides a method for inducing a target bacterium to enter into a viable but nonculturable state comprising: subjecting the target bacterium to high pressure carbon dioxide treatment, so as to make it enter into the viable but nonculturable state. In the above method, the conditions of the high pressure carbon dioxide treatment are: a pressure of 5-7 MPa, a temperature of 25-37° C., and a time of 5-60 min. In the above method, the conditions of the high pressure carbon dioxide treatment are as follows: a pressure of 5 MPa, a temperature of 25° C., and a time of 40 min; or a pressure of 5 MPa, a temperature of 31 ° C., and a time of 30 min; or a pressure of 5 MPa, a temperature of 37° C., and a time of 25 min. In an example of the present invention, the target bacterium is subjected to a high pressure carbon dioxide treatment using high pressure carbon dioxide equipment. In an example of the present invention, the model of the high pressure carbon dioxide equipment is CAU-HPCD-1 (a high density of carbon dioxide sterilization equipment, disclosed in the patent ZL200520132590.X), and the specific steps are: 20 mL of bacteria liquid to be induced (bacteria suspension) was put into a glass bottle, and sealed with a sealing film; the bacteria liquid was put into a reaction kettle, and treated with HPCD at a pressure of 5 MPa and a temperature of 25° C., with the pressure being held for 40 min; and the kettle was immediately depressurized when the above treating parameters were achieved; the induced bacteria liquid was thus obtained. Prior to the high pressure carbon dioxide treatment, the above method further comprises the following step: washing and suspending the target bacterium to obtain the bacteria suspension. In the above method, a physiological saline is used for both the washing and the suspending, and the physiological saline is specifically a 0.85% (mass percent) NaCl aqueous solution. In the above method, the target bacterium is a target bacterium in exponential phase. In the above method, the target bacterium is Escherichia coli, and the Escherichia coli is specifically Escherichia coli O157:H7. After the high pressure carbon dioxide treatment, the above method further comprises the following steps: detecting the number of viable bacteria and culturable bacteria of the target bacterium after an inducing treatment; if the number of culturable bacteria is zero but the number of viable bacteria is not, the target bacterium enters into a viable but nonculturable state; wherein, the PI/SYTO 9 double staining method is used for detection of the number of viable bacteria of the target bacterium after the inducing treatment, and the plate counting method is used for the detection of the number of culturable bacteria of the target bacterium after the inducing treatment. Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for culturing bacteria. The method for culturing bacteria provided by the present invention comprises the steps of the above method.

EXAMPLE 1 Inducing Bacterium to Enter into a Viable but Nonculturable State I. Induction by High Pressure Carbon Dioxide. 1. Preparation of Bacterial Suspension. Escherichia coli O157:H7 (strain No. NCTC12900) in exponential growth phase was washed twice with 0.85% (mass percent) NaCl aqueous solution, and then resuspended in 0.85% (mass percent) NaCl aqueous solution, making the concentration of the bacteria be about 108 cfu/mL, as the bacteria liquid to be induced (bacteria suspension). 2. High Pressure Carbon Dioxide Treatment Experimental group: the bacteria liquid is subjected to the high pressure carbon dioxide treatment using a self-designed high pressure carbon dioxide sterilization equipment (model: CAU-HPCD-1, a high density of carbon dioxide sterilization equipment, disclosed in the patent ZL200520132590.X); the specific steps are: 20 mL of bacteria liquid to be induced (bacteria suspension) was put into a glass bottle, and sealed with a sealing film; the bacteria liquid was put into a reaction kettle, and treated with HPCD at a pressure of 5 MPa and a temperature of 25° C., with the pressure being held for 40 min; the kettle was immediately depressurized when above treating parameters were achieved; the induced bacteria liquid was thus obtained. Control group: the bacteria liquid to be induced was not treated with high pressure carbon dioxide, but only placed at 25° C. for 40 min. II. Detection Method for determining the number of viable bacteria: the PI/SYTO 9 double staining method was used; specific steps are: a proportioned dye mixture (volume ratio of PI:SYTO 9 was 1:1) was mixed with the induced bacteria liquid or the control in a ratio of 3:1000, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark after evenly mixed; after incubation, the bacteria were observed and counted under a fluorescence microscope (1000×), typically 10 fields were selected, and one sample was repeated twice. Method for determining the number of culturable bacteria: the plate counting method was used; specific steps: refer to the method of GB 4789.2-2010, the induced bacteria liquid was serially (1:10) diluted with 0.85% NaCl; 1 mL of diluted sample of each of 3 successive dilutions was aspirated into a sterilized dish, respectively, and 20 mL of TSA culture media were poured thereto and shaken well; after the culture media were solidified, the plates were turned upside down and cultured in an 37° C. incubator for 24 h, and then the numbers of bacterial colonies were recorded. The numbers of viable bacteria and culturable bacteria of experimental group and control group were detected using the above methods respectively, and thereby the number of bacteria in viable but nonculturable state (the number of viable bacteria−the number of culturable bacteria) was calculated. Whether the bacterium entered into the viable but nonculturable state was detected. When the number of culturable bacteria was zero but the number of viable bacteria was not, the bacterium was considered as being in the viable but nonculturable state. The results were as follows: the number of viable bacteria of the induced bacteria liquid of the experimental group was 106.79 cfu/mL; the number of culturable bacteria of the induced bacteria liquid was 0; the number of bacteria entering into the viable but nonculturable state was 106.79 cfu/mL. The number of culturable bacteria of the control group was still about 108 cfu/mL, which was basically considered as no bacterium entering into the viable but nonculturable state. Thus, it can be seen that, in the present methods, E. coli O157:H7 in the viable but nonculturable state was obtained when being induced with high pressure carbon dioxide for 40 min, while the method of oligotrophy combined with low temperatures currently used needs one month to obtain viable but nonculturable cells. Therefore, the methods of the present invention may induce bacteria to enter into the viable but nonculturable state rapidly. EXAMPLE 2 Inducing Bacterium to Enter into a Viable but Nonculturable State I. Induction by High Pressure Carbon Dioxide. 1. Preparation of Bacterial Suspension. The method was the same as that of step 1 of I in Example 1. 2. High Pressure Carbon Dioxide Inducement. The method was substantially the same as that of step 2 of I in Example 1, only changing the treatment temperature to 31° C., and the pressure holding time to 30 min; and the induced bacteria liquid was obtained. II. Detection The method was the same as that of II in Example 1. The results were as follows: the number of viable bacteria of the induced bacteria liquid of the experimental group was 106.89 cfu/mL; the number of culturable bacteria of the induced bacteria liquid was 0; thus, the number of bacteria entering into the viable but nonculturable state was 106.89 cfu/mL. The number of culturable bacteria of the control group was still about 108 cfu/mL, which was basically considered as no bacterium entering into the viable but nonculturable state. Thus, it can be seen that, E. coli O157:H7 in the viable but nonculturable state was obtained when being induced with high pressure carbon dioxide for 30 min in the methods of the present invention. As compared with Example 1, the time for inducing E. coli O157:H7 to enter into the viable but nonculturable state by high pressure carbon dioxide was more shortened in the present Example, and the number of bacteria in the viable but nonculturable state obtained was close to that of Example 1. EXAMPLE 3 Inducing Bacterium to Enter into the Viable but Nonculturable State Rapidly I. Induction by High Pressure Carbon Dioxide. 1. Preparation of Bacterial Suspension. The method was the same as that of step 1 of I in Example 1. 2. High Pressure Carbon Dioxide Inducement. The method was substantially the same as that of step 1 of I in Example 1, only changing the treatment temperature to 37° C., and the pressure holding time to 25 min; and then the induced bacteria liquid was obtained. The results were as follows: the number of viable bacteria of the induced bacteria liquid of the experimental group was 105.72 cfu/mL; the number of culturable bacteria of the induced bacteria liquid was 0; thus, the number of bacteria entering into the viable but nonculturable state was 105.72 cfu/mL. The number of culturable bacteria of the control group was still about 108 cfu/mL, which was basically considered as no bacterium entering into the viable but nonculturable state. Thus, it can be seen that, in the methods of the present invention, E. coli O157:H7 in the viable but nonculturable state was obtained when being induced with high pressure carbon dioxide for 25 min. As compared with Examples 1 and 2, the time for inducing E. coli O157:H7 to enter into the viable but nonculturable state by high pressure carbon dioxide was shorter in the present Example, while the number of bacteria in the viable but nonculturable state obtained was lower than that of Examples 1 and 2.
