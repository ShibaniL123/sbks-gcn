Liposome having inner water phase containing sulfobutyl ether cvclodextrin salt FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a liposome having inner water phase containing sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin salt, to methods for manufacturing the liposome and to the use thereof in preparing a medicament for the treatment of tumor diseases. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As a carrier of drugs, a liposome has the characteristics such as enhancing therapeutic efficacy, reducing adverse effects, target delivering, and delayed release. Especially where a liposome is used as the carrier of anti-tumor drug, the drug can be targetedly delivered to tumor area and thus has reduced toxicity and enhanced efficacy. There are many anti-tumor drugs in clinical application which can be categorized into 5 groups: cytotoxic agents, hormones, biological response modifier, monoclonal antibodies and other anti-tumor drugs. Among them, cytotoxic agents capture the biggest market share, and they can be categorized into 5 groups according to mechanism of action: (1) drugs acting on DNA chemical structure, such as alkylating agents and platinum compounds; (2) drugs modifying nucleic acid synthesis, such as methotrexate and fluorouracil; (3) drugs acting on nucleic acid transcription, such as doxorubicin and epidoxorubicin; (4) drugs acting on tubulin synthesis, such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids; drugs acting on topoisomerase, such as camptothecin; (5) other cytotoxic drugs. Among them, the drugs of groups (2) and (4) are of cell cycle-specific character, can only kill cells in specific period of malignant tumor cell proliferation cycle. Vinorelbine and topotecan are of the groups and are intensively investigated in the present invention. It is necessary to control the drug release from liposome with the aim of reducing toxicity and enhancing efficacy, where anti-tumor drug with cell cycle-specific character is prepared into liposome. In case of too fast drug releases from liposome, the following results will be incurred: (1) part of drug is released from liposome before reaching tumor area and is cleared from blood too quickly to reach tumor area; (2) in view that tumor cells are in different growth periods at the same time, the drug reaching tumor area can not kill cells out of specific periods, which induces greatly reduced exposure of the drug to tumor cells and has a poor therapeutic efficacy but induces toxic response of normal tissues. So it is important to control the drug release from liposome especially for the drugs with cell cycle-specific character. The release of liposomal drug is influenced by diversified factors including particle size, lipid membrane composition, inner water phase and methods of drug loading, inter alia. Methods of drug loading include active drug loading and passive drug loading. Passive drug loading is generally suitable for lipid-soluble drugs, while active drug loading is generally suitable for water-soluble drugs. Since vinorelbine and topotecan are both water-soluble weak alkalescent drugs, active drug loading is chosen to prepare their liposomes. Three methods of active drug loading are commonly used in the art: pH gradient method, ammonium sulfate gradient method and complexation gradient method. (1) pH gradient method: This method is invented by Canadian investigators in the 1980’s. They discovered that pharmaceutical alkaloids such as doxorubicin could be actively transported and specifically aggregated into liposomes in the presence of pH gradient. The first thing in the process of preparation is to choose inner water phase buffer and outer phase buffer, which is critical since the buffers directly determines the stability of drug in storage and the release of drug in vivo. A blank liposome is formed by hydration with inner water phase buffer. The thus-obtained blank liposome is further processed to reduce the particle size within a desired range. Next, outer phase of the liposome may be replaced by using the technical means such as cross flow dialysis, column chromatography and pH modulation, so as to form pH gradient between outer and inner transmembrane phases. The drug loading may be accomplished at an appropriate temperature after the transmembrane gradient is formed. Also the transmembrane pH gradient can be formed using an ionophore. During the preparation of the blank liposome, divalent ion salt, such as manganese sulfate, is encapsulated into the liposome, and then the outer phase of liposome is replaced by a buffer containing an ionophore, such as Α23187 and EDTA. The ionophore can specifically transport divalent ion to outside of membrane and transport H+ to inside of liposome. Use of the above method can also form pH gradient between inside and outside of the membrane. The mechanism of drug loading by pH gradient has been intensively investigated. Among 3 anthracycline liposome preparations available in the market, 2 preparations are prepared by active drug loading using pH gradient. (2) ammonium sulfate gradient method Ammonium sulfate gradient method is invented by Israeli investigators in early 1990’s. The preparation process in this method is similar to that in traditional pH gradient method. First, blank liposome is prepared by using ammonium sulfate buffer. Then, ammonium sulfate in outer phase of the liposome is removed by cross flow dialysis inter alia to form ammonium sulfate gradient between the inside and the outside of lipid membrane. Then drug loading is accomplished under the condition of heating. It is confirmed in initial research that the drug loading by ammonium sulfate gradient may be related to pH difference between the inside and the outside of the phospholipid membrane caused by transmembrane diffusion of free ammonia. However, it is shown by strict theoretical deduction that the drug loading using ammonium sulfate gradient method may be a complicated process of double-directional diffusion, and the formation of pH gradient may be merely one of the factors. The advantage of ammonium sulfate gradient method lies in that approximately neutral pH of the ammonium sulfate aqueous solution could not induce hydrolyzation of excess phospholipid molecules, because a relatively high temperature is required if saturated phospholipid is used to prepare the liposome. The lipid is apt to hydrolyze when traditional pH gradient method is used. Moreover, the in vivo drug release of the liposome prepared using ammonuim gradient method may be different. (3) complexation gradient method In this method, transition metal ion salt, such as copper sulfate or nickel sulfate is used in inner water phase buffer to prepare blank liposome. Next, metal ion outside the liposome is removed by cross flow dialysis among others to form the metal ion gradient between the inside and the outside of lipid membrane. Then drug loading is accomplished under the condition of heating. The mechanism of drug loading is that the drug forms a stable complex with transition metal ion in the inner water phase of liposome and is thus restrained within liposome. Sulfobutyl ether-P-cyclodextrin (SBE-P-CD) is an ionized derivative of p-cyclodextrin (P-CD) developed by Cydex of US in 1990’s, which is the product of substitution reaction of P-CD with 1,4-butane sultone. The substitution may occur at hydroxyl group of position 2, 3, 6 in glucose unit of SBE-P-CD. SBE-P-CD is an excellent pharmaceutical excipient having the advantages such as good water-solubility, low nephrotoxicity and low haemolysis, and is licensed by FDA as an excipient for injection. SBE-P-CD has been so far used for solubilization by inclusion of insoluble drug, and has been used widely in various dosage forms such as injection, oral formualtion, topical formulation inter alia. Chakraborty used SBE-P-CD to investigate liposomal preparation of amphotericin Β, with the aim of using solubilization by inclusion of insoluble drug by SBE-P-CD (Therapeutic and hemolytic evaluation of in-situ liposomal preparation containing amphotericin-B complexed with different chemically modified P-cyclodextrins. J Pharm Pharmaceut Sci. 2003 Vol.6, Νο.2). Wang Zhixuan & Deng Yingjie, et αℓ. (Advances in liposome entrapped drug cyclodextrin complex delivery systems, Journal of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 2006 Vol.23) review world-wide researches of liposome entrapped drug cyclodextrin complex, which is prepared by making insoluble drug into water-soluble cyclodextrin complex and entrapping the complex into inner water phase of liposome. It is difficult for insoluble drug to enter inner water phase of liposome, while complexation-inclusion by cyclodextrin increase water-solubility of the insoluble drug, and thus it is easy to entrap the drug into liposome. The main aim of making drug into liposome entrapped drug cyclodextrin complex is to increase the solubility of insoluble drug and thus the drug loading. As the first-line drugs in anti-tumor therapy, liposomal preparations of vinorelbine and topotecan have been intensively investigated. Now the drug loading of liposomal vinorelbine and topotecan have been investigated by many research groups. However, some problems rise such as the following: Inex company of Canada achieves the drug loading by using sphingomyelin and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 55:45 as lipid membrane, using magnesium sulfate solution as inner water phase to prepare blank liposome, then transporting magnesium ion out of the liposomal membrane via the ionophore Α23187 and transporting H+ to inside of liposome, and thus generating pH gradient. The thus-obtained liposomal vinorelbine has an encapsulation rate of more than 90%, and is stable when stored at 2-8 °C for one year (Optimization and characterization of a sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome formulation of vinorelbine with promising antitumor activity. Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2005 Vol.94 Νο.5.) A Canadian research group leaded by Bally uses 2 methods and obtains topotecan liposomes having high encapsulation rate. In the first method, DSPC and cholesterol are used as lipid membrane, manganese sulfate solution as inner water phase to prepare blank liposome. Then pH gradient is formed using the ionophore Α23187 and the drug loading is achieved. The mechanism of this method is similar to that used by Inex company. The second method uses DSPC and cholesterol as lipid membrane, copper sulfate solution as inner water phase to prepare blank liposome. However, the loading of topotecan is accomplished without adding Α23187, because a stable complex is formed between copper ion and topotecan. The principle used herein is just the complexation gradient method as described above. The disadvantage of this method is that remaining metal ion in the formulation may cause toxic effect in blood (An evaluation of transmembrane ion gradient-mediated encapsulation of topotecan within liposomes. Journal of Controlled Release. 96 (2004); Copper-topotecan complexation mediates drug accumulation into liposomes. Journal of Controlled Release. 114 (2006)) US investigators use distearoyl phosphatidyl choline (DSPC), cholesterol and distearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine-methoxyl-polyethylene glycol conjugate (DSPE-mPEG) as lipid membrane, use triethylamine (ΤΛ) salt of sucrose octasulfate as inner water phase to prepare blank liposome. Then ΤΑ sucrose octasulfate is removed using cross flow dialysis inter alia to form ΤΑ sucrose octasulfate gradient, and the loading of drug is accomplished. The principle is substantively identical to that used in ammonium sulfate gradient method. However, each sucrose octasulfate molecular has 8 acid groups and can form a tight complex with vinorelbine, and thus vinorelbine is well restrained. The plasma half-life of the thus-obtained vinorelbine liposome is up to 9.2 hours (Improved pharmacokinetics and efficacy of a highly stable nanoliposomal vinorelbine. The journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. 2009 Vol.328 Νο.1.). The serious concern in this method is that sucrose octasulfate is physiologically active and activates fibroblast growth factor in vivo (Structural basis for activation of fibroblast growth factor signaling by sucrose octasulfate. MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY, Oct. 2002, Vol. 22, No. 20), and induce a series of physiological effects. Therefore, the use of sucrose octasulfate as an excipient for injection may have a great risk. Alza company of US uses hydrogenated soybean phosphatidyl choline (HSPC), cholesterol and DSPE-mPEG as lipid membrane, uses polyanion polymer, such as dextran sulphate, proteoglycan sulphate and cellulose sulphate, in inner water phase. Then cross flow dialysis is used to replace outer phase and form a polymer gradient, and the drug loading is accomplished. The principle is similar to that used in ammonium sulfate gradient method. This method has the aim of forming a tight complex of polyanion polymer with topotecan, and thus the drug is well restrained. The disadvantage of this method is also that the polyanion polymers are physiologically active and difficult to be metabolized in vivo, so the safety thereof shall be further investigated (Liposome-entrapped topoisomerase inhibitors. US6465008B1). It is known from the above that the investigations of liposomes of weak alkalescent drugs, such as vinorelbine and topotecan focus on pH gradient method, general ammonium sulfate gradient method and complexation gradient method. However, they are only tested in laboratory and the materials used have safety risk: (1) the polyanionic salt, such as triethylamine salt of sucrose octasulfate and sulfate polymer, used in the above investigations are all physiologically active, and do not meet the requirement that an excipient should be inactive of physiology and of pharmacology; (2) copper ion, nickel ion, manganese ion used in the above complexation gradient method are all heavy metal ion, and their remainder in the formulation are harmful to human. Moreover, because tumor is difficult to be cured and medication is generally a long time, the in vivo accumulation of heavy metal ion will go beyond the patient tolerance. So it is still required to develop a novel liposome and corresponding method of drug loading. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to a liposome comprising bilayer and inner water phase, wherein the inner water phase contains sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin or its salt and active compound.

In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing the liposome of the present invention described above, comprising: (1) hydrating lipid phase powder with aqueous solution of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin or its salt to form a blank liposome comprising the aqueous solution of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin or its salt as inner water phase, (2) removing the salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin in the outer phase of the blank liposome obtained in step (1) to form an anion gradient, (3) optionally, if the salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin is a metal ion salt, adding an ionophore of the metal ion to the outer phase of the blank liposome obtained in step (2) to form a pH gradient, and (4) incubating the blank liposome obtained in step (2) or (3) with active compound in aqueous solution to encapsulate the active compound into the liposome. According to one embodiment of the process for preparing the liposome in the present invention, wherein the ionophore of the metal ion is the ionophore Α23187. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a liposomal pharmaceutical preparation, comprising the liposome according to any of the present invention described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient. According to some embodiments of the liposomal pharmaceutical preparation in the present invention, wherein the carrier and/or excipient comprises osmotic regulator and/or antioxidant. In another further aspect, the present invention provides use of the liposome according to any of the present invention described above in manufacture of a medicament for treatment of a tumor in a patient, wherein the active compound in the liposome is one or more of vinorelbine, vincristine, topotecan and irinotecan. In yet a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating a tumor in a patient, comprising administering the liposome of the present invention described above to the patient. The development of novel methods depends on the investigation of mechanism of traditional drug loading. Firstly, the ammonium sulfate gradient method is analyzed, which comprises the following process: driven by concentration and pH difference, high-concentration drug in outer phase of the liposome overcomes resistance of lipid membrane (phospholipid bilayer) and comes into the inner water phase of the liposome. The drug which comes into the inner water phase is protonated and precipitates with S042", and is restrained stably in the liposome. It is needed to dissociate from the precipitate and diffuse out from the liposome for drug release. Therefore, the microscopic structure and solubility of the precipitate determine the release rate of drug from the liposome and further determine the safety and effectiveness of the formulation. The microscopic structure and complexity of the precipitate formed by the drug and S042" are related to the spatial structure and weak alkalescence of the drug. Some drug, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, is apt to form precipitate with S042" due to its strong alkalescence. Moreover, the drug molecules can pile up on each other due to quasi-planar structure of the molecule, and a compact elongated precipitate is formed within the liposome as microscopically shown. Therefore, doxorubicin hydrochloride can be well restrained in the liposome and the half-life t]/2 of its liposomal formulation in KM mice is more than 15 hours. To the contrary, other drugs, such as vinorelbine and topotecan, are weak alkalescent and thus have a poor ability to precipitate with SO42', and the drug molecules can not pile up on each other due to non-planar structure of the molecule. Therefore, the ti/2 in KM mice is less than 5 hours even if the liposome is prepared by using the same lipid composition and method as those of the above doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome. The half-life is so short that most of the drug leaked out from the liposome in blood circulation and can not reach tumor area. Even a small ratio of the liposomal drug which reached tumor area will be released out quickly. It is undesired for anti-tumor drug with cell cycle-specific character to exert its effect. It is concluded that one of the critical factors for drug release is the complexity of the precipitate formed between drug and anion. The weak alkalescence of the drug such as vinorelbine and topotecan is unchangeable, so it is critical to find anions which can associate and form compact precipitate with the drug, and polyanionic compounds having complicated structure may form a stable complex with them. It is experimentally demonstrated that efficient encapsulation of weak alkalescent drug, such as vinorelbine or topotecan, can be achieved in the present invention. In vitro release test and pharmacokinetic test confirm that, in comparison to the conventioanl ammonium sulfate inner water phase formulation, the release rate of the liposomal drug of the present invention is markedly extended. The present invention is also suitable for other anti-tumor drugs, such as vincristine and irinotecan, with similar weak alkalescence of vinorelbine and topotecan. The present inventors break conventional idea of using inclusion action of SBE-P-CD, but employ its multi-anion character to use it as inner water phase of the liposome and to actively load the drug. The use of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin salt as inner water phase to load drug has a similar principle as that in the use of ammonium sulfate as inner water phase, by which the anion in inner water phase forms precipitate with the drug molecule and thus extend drug release. However, each sulfobutyl ether molecule has 6.5 S032'at average, and can bind to multiple drug molecules simultaneously and form more complex precipitate structure. So high encapsulation rate is achieved, and the drug retention time is significantly extended in comparison to the liposome with ammonium sulfate as inner water phase. The liposome prepared with sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin in the present invention is completely different from the conventional cyclodextrin inclusion liposome. The present invention is not to solve the solubility problem of insoluble drug, but to extend the retention time in the liposome of weak alkalescent drug, and to increase the drug encapsulation rate. In addition, the examples in the present invention confirmed that the encapsulation rate was so low when the liposome is prepared only by using the inclusion action of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin, which cannot meet clinical medication need. To obtain liposomal preparations with good properties, a salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin should be prepared first, and then the liposome should be prepared using a proper method. The method used in the present invention comprises: (A) Preparation of salts of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin: preparing aqueous solution of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin, and salifying with triethylamine, triethanolamine, ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide. (Β) Preparation of liposomes: dissolving lipid excipients in an organic solvent, removing the organic solvent by lyophilization and then obtaining a loose lipid powder, hydrating the lipid phase powder with aqueous solution of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin salt to form a blank liposome. Then reducing the particle size of the blank liposome by a micro-jet apparatus or a high pressure extrusion apparatus, removing the salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin in outer phase of the liposome by dialysis or column chromatography inter alia to form an anion transmembrane gradient. If the salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin used is a metal ion salt, the addition of metal ionophore is required. The metal ionophore can be inserted into phospholipid membrane to exchange internal metal ion and external hydrogen ion, and thus a pH gradient is formed. Then the liposomal preparation is obtained by incubation the drug solution and the liposome suspension. Sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin used in the present invention shall be imported currently. However, it can be produced in bulk with good quality and meet the need of large scale production. In summary, in the present invention, use of salts of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin as liposome inner water phase is completely feasible in consideration of drug encapsulation, retention effect and economic cost. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, which is only exemplary and should not be construed as a limitation to the scope of the present invention. As used herein, the drug/lipid ratio refers to weight ratio of drug to phospholipid, and “the content of DSPE-mPEG” Refers to its molar percentage in the total phospholipid components in liposomal bilayer. Example 1 General process of preparation of liposomes with sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin (SBE-CD) as inner water phase (with the formulation of SBE-CD) HSPC, cholesterol and DSPE-mPEG2000 at a mass ratio of 3:1:1 were mixed and dissolved in 95% t-butyl alcohol. The organic solvent was removed by lyophilization to obtain a loose lipid powder. The powder was hydrated with aqueous solution of sulfobutyl ether P-cyclodextrin at 50-60°C and incubated for 1 hour to obtain a heterogenous multivesicular liposome. The particle size of the liposome was reduced by a micro-jet apparatus. Anion in outer phase of the blank liposome was removed by an ultrafiltration apparatus to form a dynamic transmembrane gradient. An aqueous drug solution was added to the blank liposome at an appropriate drug/lipid ratio, and the drug loading was achieved by incubation at 60°C for 1 hour. Example 2 General process of preparation of liposomes with triethylamine salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin as inner water phase (with the formulation of SBE-CD/TA) HSPC, cholesterol and DSPE-mPEG2000 at a mass ratio of 3:1:1 were mixed and dissolved in 95% t-butyl alcohol. The organic solvent was removed by lyophilization to obtain a loose lipid powder. The powder was hydrated with aqueous solution of triethylamine salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin at 50-60°C and incubated for 1 hour to obtain a heterogenous multivesicular liposome. The particle size of the liposome was reduced by a high pressure extrusion apparatus. Anion in outer phase of the blank liposome was removed by an ultrafiltration apparatus to form a dynamic transmembrane gradient. An aqueous drug solution was added to the blank liposome at an appropriate drug/lipid ratio, and the drug loading was achieved by incubation at 60°C for 1 hour. Example 3 General process of preparation of liposomes with sodium salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin as inner water phase (with the formulation of SBE-CD/Na) HSPC, cholesterol and DSPE-mPEG2000 at a mass ratio of 3:1:1 were mixed and dissolved in 95% t-butyl alcohol. The organic solvent was removed by lyophilization to obtain a loose lipid powder. The powder was hydrated with aqueous solution of sodium salt of sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrin at 50-60°C and incubated for 1 hour to obtain a heterogenous multivesicular liposome. The particle size of the liposome was reduced by a high pressure extrusion apparatus. Anion in outer phase of the blank liposome was removed by column chromatography, and then ethanol solution of nikkomycin in an appropriate amount was added (20 ng nikkomycin/lmg HSPC). The resulting mixture was incubated at 60°C for ten minutes, so as to exchange hydrogen ion and sodium ion across the liposomal membrane, so as to form a pH gradient. An aqueous drug solution was added to the blank liposome at an appropriate drug/lipid ratio, and the drug loading was achieved by incubation at 60°C for 1 hour. Example 4 Comparison of encapsulation rate of liposomes containing various internal water phase. The liposomes of various drugs with 3 respective inner water phases were prepared as described in Example 1, 2 and 3, at a drug/lipid ratio of 2:9.58 (see table 1). Table 1: Effect of intraliposomal trapping agent on drug loading Encapsulation rate of liposomes having Drug different inner water phases (%) SBE-CD SBE-CD/TA SBE-CD/Na Mitoxatrone hydrochloride 7.6 48.5 77.6 Topotecan hydrochloride 4.8 63.6 74.6 Irinotecan hydrochloride 5.3 64.1 96.1 Doxorubicin hydrochloride 11.3 63.5 91.8 Vinorelbine bitartrate 4.7 38.2 75.9 Vincristine sulfate 3.8 47.8 79.7 Conclusion: as can be seen from encapsulation rate as disclosed, the liposome having SBE-CD as inner water phase has a poor encapsulation rate, while high encapsulation rates were achieved with SBE-CD/TA and SBE-CD/Na, which illustrates that a good encapsulation cannot be achieved unless a pH gradient is formed by ion transporting. The drug is firstly protonated after entering inner water phase of the liposome, and then associates with SBE-CD, while drug loading is hardly achieved depending exclusively on inclusion effect of SBE-CD. Example 5 In vitro release of liposomal vincristine formulations containing different inner water phase (SBE-CD/TA vs ammonium sulfate). 1, Samples The vincristine liposomes were prepared at a drug/lipid ratio of 3:9.58, as described in Example 2 for the liposome having SBE-CD/TA as inner water phase, and as described in Exmaple 2, with the exception of the replacement of sulfobutyl ether-P-cyclodextrin triethylamine salt with ammonium sulfate, for the liposome having ammonium sulfate as inner water phase. 2, Release condition Samples of liposomal vincristine formulations were diluted by 10 times in release buffer (5 mM NH4C1/10 mM histidine/260 mM glucose, pH 7.0) and transferred into the dialysis bags. The dialysis was performed against a 200-fold volume of dialysis buffer in dissolution flask. Release test was performed at 37°C, 75rpm. At various time points (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 24 h), aliquots were withdrawn for analysis. 3, Results Table 2: Release of vincristine liposomes with different inner water phases Drug release rate at different time (%) Inner water phase lh 2h 4h 6h 8h 24h t,/2(h) SBE-CD/TA 22 31 44 52 61 94 7.2 ammonium sulfate 26 62 91 97 98 99 1.1 Conclusion: In comparison to the liposome having ammonium sulfate as inner water phase, the liposome having SBE-CD/TA as inner water phase significantly extended the retention of drug in inner water phase.

The dialysis was performed against a 200-fold volume of dialysis buffer in dissolution flask. Release test was performed at 37°C, 75rpm. At various time points (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h), aliquots were withdrawn for analysis. 3, Results Table 4: In vitro release of liposomal vinorelbine formulations having different internal water phase Sampling Release rate for different inner water phase (%) time (h) A Β C D Ε F 1 34.9 25.1 33.2 36.0 39.1 68.3 2 56.6 51.8 59.0 63.1 67.7 91.5 4 83.6 83.5 89.3 90.2 93.4 98.6 8 97.4 97.2 98.0 98.5 98.6 99.3 Conclusion: The liposomes having high SBE-CD/NH3 proportion in the mixed inner water phase displayed relatively slow drug release, indicating that ammonium salt of SBE-CD could extend drug release. Example 7 Pharmacokinetics for the liposomes having ammonium sulfate, different ammonium salts of SBE-CD as inner water phase 1, Samples Vinorelbine, vincristine and irinotecan liposomes were prepared at a drug/ lipid ratio of 2:9.58, as described in Example 2 with exception of the replacement of SBE-p-CD/TA with (NH4)2S04 for (NH4)2S04 as inner water phase, as described in Example 2 for SBE-CD/TA as inner water phase, and as described in Example 2 with exception of the replacement of SBE-P-CD/TA with SBE-P-CD/NH3 for SBE-CD/NH3 as inner water phase. 2, Animals and dosage This example was conducted in male DBA/2 mice, and the dosage was 10 mg/kg. 3, Results Table 5: Plasma pharmacokinetics of liposome formulations having different inner water phase Inner water phase Vinorelbine Vincristine Irinotecan SBE-CD/TA 4.4 67.3 8.6 sbe-cd/nh3 5.4 46.2 11.3 (NH4)2S04 3.1 27.6 4.1 Half-life for different drug liposome (h) Inner water phase Conclusion: As shown in pharmacokinetic results, in comparison to the liposome having ammonium sulfate as inner water phase, the liposomes having SBE-CD/NH3 as inner water phase exhibit significantly extended half life. Example 8 Efficacies of vinorelbine liposomes having different inner water phase on LLC tumor model 1, Formulations Formulation 1: SBE-CD/TA as inner water phase, prepared as described in Example 2. Formulation 2: Ammonium sulfate as inner water phase, prepared as described in Example 2 with exception of the replacement of SBE-p-CD/TA with ammonium sulfate. In both formulations, drug/lipid ratio is 3:9.58, and the content of DSPE-mPEG2000 is 0.5%. 2, Experiments LLC lung cancer cells were collected, and diluted with DMEM medium. After dilution, the tumor cell number was modulated to 2.0*106 cells/ml. 0.2 mL of the tumor cell suspension containing about 4χ105 tumor cells was inoculated into forward limb oxter subcutaneous tissue of female C57 mice under aseptic condition. Fourteen days after inoculation, mice were randomized by tumor volume into three groups and administered with a single i.v. injection at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The mice were bred normally after administration. Tumor diameters were measured to dynamically evaluate anti-tumor efficacies of different formulations. Tumor volume (TV) was calculated with the following formula: TV = 1/2 x a x b2, in which a and b represent length and width, respectively. The tumor volumes were calculated by using the measurement results.

Relative tumor proliferation rate T/C (%) was calculated with the following formula: T/C % = TRTV / CRTV x 100%, in which TRTV and CRTV represent relative tumor volume (RTV) of treatment group and of negative control group, respectively. RTV = Vt / Vo. Vo means tumor volumn of day 0 (initial dosage), and Vt means tumor volume at each measuring day. Regarding relative tumor volume proliferation rate of SBE-CD group and ammonium sulfate group, the lowest T/C % were 51.8% and 31.1% respectively. That is, anti-tumor efficacy of SBE-CD group on LLC lung cancer was superior to that of ammonium sulfate group. Example 9 Anti-tumor efficacies of topotecan liposomes having different inner water phase on prostate RM-1 tumor model 1, Formulations Formulation 1: SBE-CD/TA as inner water phase, prepared as described in Example 2. Formulation 2: Sucrose octasulfate as inner water phase, prepared as described in Example 2 with exception of the replacement of SBE-P-CD/TA with sucrose octasulfate. In both formulations, drug/lipid ratio is 3:9.58, and the content of DSPE-mPEG2000 is 0.5%. 2, Experiments RM-1 lung cancer cells were collected, and diluted with 1640 medium. After dilution, the tumor cell number was modulated to 2.0χ106 cells/ml. 0.2 mL of the tumor cell suspension containing about 4x10s tumor cells was inoculated into forward limb oxter subcutaneous tissue of female C57 mice under aseptic condition. Twelve days after inoculation, mice were randomized by tumor volume into groups and administered with a single i.v. injection at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The mice were bred normally after administration. Tumor diameters were measured to dynamically evaluate anti-tumor efficacies of different formulations. Tumor volume (TV) was calculated with the following formula: TV = 1/2 x a x b2, in which a and b represent length and width, respectively. The tumor volumes were calculated by using the measurement results. The experiment data were analyzed using SPSS 11.5 statistics software. 3, Results Table 7: The antineoplastic effects of topotecan liposomes on RM-1 tumour model (η=10, x±sd ) after Tumor volume (mm3) administration SBE-CD/TA Sucrose octasulfate Free topotecan 5% glucose control 0 220.1±70.1 218.8±67.3 223.0±65.7 219.6±60.2 2 339.2±145.0* 336.8±96.3* 484.0±154.7 468.9±137.7 4 397.3±234.4* 347.0±117.8** 606.0±183.1 765.3±415.2 6 483.1±253.6** 500.3±165.5** 1060.7±393.0 1376.9±689.3 8 690.2±656.7* 640.7±280.7** 1301.8±563.7 2082.9±1508.7 9 914.0±691.4* 734.2±343.6* 1628.5±835.4 2598.7±2148.2 13 1876.2±1931.9* 1247.8±858.7** 3592.9±1523.5 4499.4±2946.5 15 2833.9±3016.7* 2571.1±2844.9** 6639.3±2388.2 7504.9±4335.9 **P<0.01, *P<0.05, in comparison with 5% glucose control group In comparison with 5% glucose for injection as control, free topotecan did not significantly suppress the growth of tumor (ρ > 0.05), while the tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the two groups of the liposomes having different inner water phase. Significant differences were observed in comparison with free topotecan groups with equal dosages, while no significant difference of the suppression on RM-1 tumor was observed between the two liposomal formulations.
