FIG. 8 illustrates a view of another applique 138 for a camera strap according to embodiments of the present inventions. A camera strap kit has the main strap 102 of FIG. 2, first and second connector straps, e.g., 112 and 114 of FIG. 2; and a plurality of different appliques, e.g., 101 of FIG. 2, 136 of FIGS. 7 and 138 of FIG. 8. This design is for a camera strap with interchangeable appliques or “uppers” 136, 138. The length of the strap is 34-36 inches in the body of the strap/interchangeable piece. I plan to offer various lengths of the strap body in the future (example 28″ or 30″). The strap is made of several parts, namely the 1) Strap body 6 with Loop Adhesive 5/Velcro Loop tape 4, the 2) Strap upper/Applique 1/Hook 2 Adhesive 3, the 3) End Pieces 140, and the 4) Extension/Connector 112, 114. The Strap body with Loop Adhesive/Velcro Loop tape is a first part of the strap. The purpose of the camera strap is to be worn around a person's neck or shoulder to support the weight of the camera with the camera body. It needs to be comfortable to reduce strain on the neck. In this case we have used neoprene (rubber); however a number of soft and comfy materials can used in any future modifications. The Strap Body has a core made from cushioning and a lower grip layer 8. This grip layer can be glued 7 to the lower part of the Strap Body and/or sewn on to it. The width of the Strap Body is 2 inches and can change based on future designs. This camera strap has a dual purpose, support the camera weight and to adorn the strap. The strap is adorned via various colorful/decorative fabric/vinyl/leather mounted on a Strap Upper (mounted using a Velcro™ tape) which is attached to Strap Body. The Strap Body needs to have an attachable surface as an attachment point for decorative Strap Uppers/Applique mounted on Velcro hook tape. The top of the Strap Body has a Velcro™ loop tape on it (also referred to as Loop Adhesive). This loop is attached to the upper surface of the Strap Body by the following method: Primarily Glued to the surface. This may cause the edges to peel off over time, to prevent this a binder tape is sewed over the edges of the Strap Body to secure the edges of this loop tape. Also this loop tape may be attached to the Strap Body by ONLY using an edge binding and no glue. In summary, the end construction consists of a Velcro loop tape glued to the Strap Body and its edges secured along the length with a binder tape stitched onto the edge. This secures the sides of the Velcro tape. The top and bottom of the tape are secured by embedding them in the triangular 124 or square 122 End Pieces. The Strap body 6 needs to be made from a soft cushion material such as neoprene and needs to be slightly stretchy. This is because the Strap Upper will attach onto it with Velcro “hook” 3 type attachment ribbon. This Velcro hook ribbon does not stretch and is non-elastic. Most of the Velcro hook tapes are non-elastic. Due to the nature of its use, the camera strap needs to be stretchy since it will be worn around a person's neck. This can cause a problem if both, the Strap Upper and Strap Body are non-elastic. Hence we chose to design the Strap Body to be made from elastic neoprene material. When the strap bends around the neck, the elastic Strap Body conforms to the bend and maintains a non-buckling attachment with the upper hook Velcro. A converse attachment mechanism from that described above—having the Strap Body top with a non-elastic Velcro hook tape and the Strap Upper made from an elastic Velcro loop material did not work when the main strap was made of a non-stretchy material. This was because once the applique is attached to the elastic Velcro loop material, it will prevent it from being elastic and there will be buckling when attached to the non-elastic Strap Body. The stretch property preferably goes with the loop side material because the hook material is typically more difficult of not impossible to stretch. Also, one of the main strap or the applique really needs to be stretchy or the camera strap will buckle when bent in use. The Strap upper/Applique/Hook Adhesive is a second part of the strap. The Strap upper/Applique/Hook Adhesive consists of a decorative “surface” or Applique (fabric/vinyl/leather) ribbon attached/bonded to a Velcro hook tape 1 which is attached to the Strap Body's Velcro loop surface 106. The decorative applique is attached to the Velcro hook tape 3 by—Sewing its 4 sides along all edges, sewing 4 edges along 4 sides AND gluing the tape to the Velcro hook tape or just gluing the applique to the Velcro tape (hook adhesive). The width of this applique is 1.5 inches however this may change based on business requirements or based on future designs. The End Pieces are a third part of the strap. The End Pieces are triangular 124 or slightly trapezoidal 122 in shape according to the several embodiments. These are essentially tapering in order to effectively connect the camera Strap Body to the Extension/Connectors. These are made from vinyl however can be made from leather or fabric as well. The Extension/Connector is a fourth part of the strap 112, 114. The Extension/Connector is a webbing 0.5 inches wide used to attach the camera strap to the sides of the camera. The dimension of 0.5 inches is what fits typical cameras. This webbing is 15-16 inches long on each side. It is preferably fastened by using 2 keepers and 1 tri-glide made from plastic (can be metal too) 132. It is fastened by looping it around the camera attachment, then passing it through the keepers and the tri-glide for a secure fit. While the preferred embodiments illustrate the straps are shoulder and neck straps for carrying a camera, such as a single lens reflex SLR camera body, the straps of the present inventions can be used to carry other objects such as binoculars, briefcases, luggage, rifles and shotguns, or guitars and banjos and ukuleles.
