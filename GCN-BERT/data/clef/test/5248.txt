FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention provides novel oxabicyclo [2.2.2] compounds, and their analogues thereof, which are GPR120 G protein-coupled receptor modulators, compositions containing them, and methods of using them, for example, for the treatment of diabetes and related conditions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Diabetes mellitus is a progressively debilitating disorder of epidemic proportions leading to various micro- and macrovascular complications and morbidity. The most common type of diabetes, type 2 diabetes, is characterized by increasing insulin resistance associated with inadequate insulin secretion after a period of compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as omega-3 fatty acids are known to improve sensitivity to insulin. Insulin sensitivity can be improved by exerting anti-inflammatory effects in monocytes and/or macrophages and/or by enhancing glucose uptake in adipose and muscle. GPR120 is a membrane-bound receptor responsive to PUFAs which is preferentially expressed in adipose tissue and monocytes/macrophages. To decrease the medical burden of type 2 diabetes through enhanced glycemic control, GPR120 modulator compounds hold the promise of exerting a sensitizing effect to insulin as well as potential combination with a broad range of antidiabetic drugs. [0004] The present invention relates to novel substituted bicyclic acid compounds which have the ability to modulate GPR120. Such compounds are therefore potentially useful for the treatment of diabetes and related conditions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] The present invention provides substituted oxabicyclo [2.2.2] compounds, and their analogues thereof, which are useful as GPR120 modulators, including stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or solvates thereof. [0006] The present invention also provides processes and intermediates for making the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or solvates thereof. [0007] The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and at least one of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or solvates thereof. [0008] The compounds of the invention may be used in the treatment of multiple diseases or disorders associated with GPR120, such as diabetes and related conditions, microvascular complications associated with diabetes, the macrovascular complications associated with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, Metabolic Syndrome and its component conditions, disorders of glucose metabolism, obesity and other maladies. [0009] The compounds of the invention may be used in therapy. [0010] The compounds of the invention may be used for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of multiple diseases or disorders associated with GPR120. [0011] The compounds of the invention can be used alone, in combination with other compounds of the present invention, or in combination with one or more other agent(s).

CHEMISTRY [0060] Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all stereo and optical isomers and racemates thereof where such isomers exist. The term "stereoisomer(s)" refers to compound(s) which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms are within the scope of the invention. The term "chiral" refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term "achiral" refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner. The terms "racemic mixture" and "racemate" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity. [0061] Many geometric isomers of C=C double bonds, C=N double bonds, ring systems, and the like can also be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis- and trans- (or Ε- and Ζ-) geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. [0062] The present compounds can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Optically active forms may be prepared by resolution of stereoisomeric forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Depending on the process conditions the end products of the present invention are obtained either in free (neutral) or salt form. Both the free form and the salts of these end products are within the scope of the invention. If so desired, one form of a compound may be converted into another form. A free base or acid may be converted into a salt; a salt may be converted into the free compound or another salt; a mixture of isomeric compounds of the present invention may be separated into the individual isomers. Compounds of the present invention, free form and salts thereof, may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged. It should be understood that all tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist, are included within the invention. [0063] Unless otherwise indicated, any heteroatom with unsatisfied valences is assumed to have hydrogen atoms sufficient to satisfy the valences. [0064] As used herein, the term "alkyl" or "alkylene" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms.

Of the two fused rings, one ring is a 5- or 6-membered monocyclic aromatic ring comprising a 5-membered heteroaryl ring, a 6-membered heteroaryl ring or a benzo ring, each fused to a second ring. The second ring is a 5- or 6-membered monocyclic ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated, and comprises a 5-membered heterocycle, a 6-membered heterocycle or a carbocycle (provided the first ring is not benzo when the second ring is a carbocycle). [0079] The bicyclic heterocyclic group may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom which results in a stable structure. The bicyclic heterocyclic group described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1. [0080] Examples of a bicyclic heterocyclic group are, but not limited to, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, lH-indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-quinolinyl, 2,3-dihydro-benzofuranyl, chromanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoxalinyl, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinazolinyl.

[0085] Bridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or more, preferably one to three, atoms (/.℮., C, O, Ν, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Examples of bridged rings include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge. [0086] The term "counter ion" is used to represent a negatively charged species such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, and sulfate or a positively charged species such as sodium (Na+), potassium (Κ+), calcium (Ca2+) ammonium (RnNHm+ where η=0-4 and m=0-4) and the like. [0087] When a dotted ring is used within a ring structure, this indicates that the ring structure may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated. [0088] As used herein, the term "amine protecting group" means any group known in the art of organic synthesis for the protection of amine groups which is stable to an ester reducing agent, a disubstituted hydrazine, R4-M and R7-M, a nucleophile, a hydrazine reducing agent, an activator, a strong base, a hindered amine base and a cyclizing agent. Such amine protecting groups fitting these criteria include those listed in Wuts, P.G.M. et al, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, Wiley (2007) and The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of amine protecting groups include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) acyl types such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; (2) aromatic carbamate types such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, l-(p-biphenyl)-l-methylethoxycarbonyl, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); (3) aliphatic carbamate types such as /er/-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; (4) cyclic alkyl carbamate types such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; (5) alkyl types such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; (6) trialkylsilane such as trimethylsilane; (7) thiol containing types such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl; and (8) alkyl types such as triphenylmethyl, methyl, and benzyl; and substituted alkyl types such as 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, 2-phenylethyl, and /-butyl; and trialkylsilane types such as trimethylsilane. [0089] As referred to herein, the term "substituted" means that at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C=C, C=N, or Ν=Ν). [0090] In cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g, mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N->0) derivative. [0091] When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three R groups, and at each occurrence R is selected independently from the definition of R. [0092] When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom in which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. [0093] Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. [0094] The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. [0095] Compounds of the present invention can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Unless otherwise indicated, reference to an inventive compound is understood to include reference to one or more salts thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are preferred. However, other salts may be useful, e.g., in isolation or purification steps which may be employed during preparation, and thus, are contemplated within the scope of the invention. [0096] As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic, and the like. [0097] The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Allen, L.V., Jr., ed., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 22nd Edition, Pharmaceutical Press, London, UK (2012), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. [0098] In addition, compounds of formula I may have prodrug forms. Any compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (ℓ℮., a compound of formula I) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see: a) Bundgaard, Η., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985), and Widder, Κ. et al., eds., Methods in Enzymology, 112:309-396, Academic Press (1985); b) Bundgaard, Η., Chapter 5, "Design and Application of Prodrugs", Krosgaard-Larsen, Ρ. et al., eds., A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, ρρ. 113-191, Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); c) Bundgaard, Η., Adv.

Drug Discovery, 7:255-270 (2008); and g) Rautio, J., ed., Prodrugs and Targeted Delivery (Methods and Principles in Medicinal Chemistry), Vol 47, Wiley-VCH (2011). [0099] Compounds containing a carboxy group can form physiologically hydrolyzable esters that serve as prodrugs by being hydrolyzed in the body to yield formula I compounds per se. Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of formula I include Chalky], C^alkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C| alkanoyloxy-Cp^alkyl (e.g., acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C|^alkoxycarbonyloxy-C|_^alkyl (e.g., methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-l,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl), and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art. [00100] Preparation of prodrugs is well known in the art and described in, for example, King, F.D., ed., Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK (Second Edition, reproduced, 2006); Testa, Β. et al., Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism. Chemistry, Biochemistry and Enzymology, VCHA and Wiley-VCH, Zurich, Switzerland (2003); Wermuth, C.G., ed., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Third Edition, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (2008).

By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. [00102] The term "solvate" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. "Solvate" encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates.

The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or by variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. The reactions are performed in a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention. [00105] The novel compounds of this invention may be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in this section. Also, in the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and workup procedures, are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. Restrictions to the substituents that are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used. SYNTHESIS [00106] The compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by the exemplary processes described in the following schemes and working examples, as well as relevant published literature procedures that are used by one skilled in the art. Exemplary reagents and procedures for these reactions appear hereinafter and in the working examples. Protection and de-protection in the processes below may be carried out by procedures generally known in the art (see, for example, Wuts, P.G.M. et al., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, Wiley (2007)).

[00107] Scheme 1 describes synthesis of 3-(l-aryl/heteroaryl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2] octan-2-yl)propanoic acid analogs 5. An appropriately substituted aryl or heteroaryl bromide is metalated with an appropriate lithium reagent (e.g., n-butyllithium) and reacted with cyclohexanone bis-tosylate 2 (following a literature synthesis in 6 steps from diethyl malonate and ethyl acrylate, e.g., as described in WO 2001/034610 Al) to give the intermediate cyclohexyl alcohol 3, which is treated with base (e.g., aq. NaOH) and undergoes intramolecular alkylation with one of the two equivalent tosylate groups to give the oxabicyclo[2.2.2]tosylate 3. The intermediate tosylate 3 is then reacted with a malonate ester under standard basic conditions to give the alkylated malonate ester 4. Hydrolysis of both ester groups gives the intermediate diacid, which upon heating, undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to provide carboxylic acid analogs 5.

The 4-(1-Aryl/heteroaryl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-yl)butanoic acid intermediates 6 then undergoes another Arndt-Eistert homologation sequence to provide the corresponding 5-(l-aryl/heteroaryl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-4-yl)pentanoic acid analogs 7.

The oxabicyclic tosylate 3 is first converted to the corresponding acetate (e.g., NaOAc in DMSO with heating), which is then hydrolyzed under standard basic conditions to give the alcohol 8. Alcohol 8 then undergoes a conjugate 1,4-addition with an appropriate acrylate ester followed by deprotection of the ester to provide the desired 3-oxy-substituted acid analogs 9. [00110] Scheme 4 shows the synthesis of 2-oxy-substituted 5-(l-aryl/heteroaryl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-4-yl)pentanoic acid analogs 13. Tosylate 3 is converted to the corresponding nitrile 10 (e.g., NaCN/heat), which is then subjected to reduction conditions (e.g., DIBAL-H) which converts it to the corresponding aldehyde 11, which is further reduced to the alcohol 12. Alcohol 12 is alkylated under basic conditions with an a-bromoacetate ester, followed by appropriate deprotection conditions to provide the desired 2-oxy-substituted carboxylic acid analogs 13. [00111] Scheme 5 shows the synthesis of more highly substituted aryl analogs 19. A suitably protected hydroxy aryl bromide (e.g., as an acid-labile tetrahydropyranyl ether that can be deprotected selectively in the presence of an ester) is lithiated (e.g., n-BuLi) and reacted with cyclohexanone bis-tosylate 1 to give the corresponding cyclohexanol bis-tosylate 14. Base-mediated intramolecular reaction of the alcohol with a tosylate of 26 provides the oxabicyclo[2.2.2]tosylate 15 (same 2 steps as in Scheme 1). The tosylate 15 is then converted in the same 3 step sequence as described in Scheme 4 to give the 2-oxy-substituted ester 16. Selective deprotection of the phenol is then achieved under mild acid conditions to give phenol ester 17. The phenol intermediate 17 is then subjected to an O-arylation reaction (e.g., Chan-Lam coupling reaction with aryl boronic acids; examples in Qiao, J. et al., Synthesis, 829 (2011)) to give the aryl ethers 18, followed by ester deprotection to give the corresponding 2-oxy-substituted carboxylic acid analogs 19. [00112] Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 6, the phenol intermediate 17 also undergoes reactions with alcohols R5-OH (e.g., Mitsunobu reaction), or reactions with alkyl halides R5-X under standard basic conditions, to give the corresponding alkyl ether intermediates 20 which are deprotected to give the desired corresponding 2-oxy-substituted carboxylic acid analogs 21. Scheme 6 A) Mitsunobu C0.R reaction ο-/ r5-oh Jr° OR 0 Β) Alkylation reaction OH Base/R5-X [00113] Scheme 7 shows an alternative synthetic route to pentanoic acids 7. The previously described tosylate 3 is converted to iodide 22 by a Finkelstein reaction with Nal. Iodide 22 undergoes a zinc/nickel-mediated 1,4-conjugate addition (e.g., using Zn/NiCl2.6H20/pyridine, as described in Tetrahedron Lett., 30:689-692 (1989)) with an appropriate acrylate ester to give the corresponding butanoate ester intermediate 23, which is then deprotected to give the previously described acid 6. Acid 6 is then reduced to the corresponding alcohol (e.g., borane-THF), which in turn is converted to the corresponding mesylate (methanesulfonyl chloride/base) and then reacted with NaCN to give the nitrile 24. Hydrolysis of nitrile 24 then gives the desired acid analogs 7. [00114] Scheme 8 shows the synthesis of the a,p-unsaturated carboxylic acid analogs 28 and the a,p-cyclopropyl carboxylic acid analogs 30. Alcohol 12 is converted to the corresponding nitrile 25 by a standard 2 step sequence as described for Scheme 7 (conversion to mesylate, followed by NaCN displacement of the mesylate). Nitrile 25 is reduced (e.g., DIBAL-H) to the corresponding aldehyde 26, which then undergoes a Homer-Emmons reaction with an appropriate phosphonate-ester to give the α,βunsaturated ester 27. Deprotection of ester 27 provides the desired a,p-unsaturated carboxylic acid analogs 28. Alternatively, the a,p-unsaturated ester 27 is reacted with diazomethane (e.g., procedure of Mende, U. et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 629 (1975)) to give the a,p-cyclopropyl ester 29, which is then deprotected to give the corresponding α,βcyclopropyl acid analogs 30. [00115] Scheme 9 shows the synthesis of β,γ^℮1ορκ^1 carboxylic acid analogs 36. Aldehyde 26 is subjected to a Homer-Emmons reaction with an appropriate phosphonate ester to provide the a^-unsaturated ester 31. Cyclopropanation of a^-unsaturated ester 31 with diazomethane (e.g., procedure of Mende, U. et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 629 (1975)) furnishes the a^-cyclopropyl ester 32. Reduction of the a^-cyclopropyl ester 21 (e.g., LiAlH4) provides the cyclopropyl alcohol 33, which is converted to the corresponding nitrile 34 (via the mesylate and subsequent reaction with NaCN); base-mediated hydrolysis of 34 then provides the desired β,γ^℮1ορκ^1 carboxylic acid analogs 35. [00116] Scheme 10 shows a general scheme for the synthesis of acylsulfonamide analogs 36 from the corresponding carboxylic acid analogs, in this particular case 7. This is achieved through an EDCI-mediated coupling reaction. It is understood that, in addition to acids 7, this acylsulfonamide synthesis is also applicable to any of the other previously described carboxylic acid analogs, e.g., 13, 19, 21, 30 and 35. Scheme 10 [00117] Scheme 11 shows the synthesis of another series of oxabicyclo[2.2.2] acid analogs 44. Wittig reaction of cyclohexanone-ester 37 provides the alkene-ester 38, which is subjected to palladium-mediated a-arylation of the ester with an appropriate aryl or heteroaryl halide (e.g., Johansson, C. et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 49:676 (2010)) to furnish the a-aryl ester 39. Reduction of the ester 39 (e.g, LiAlH4) provided the alkenealcohol 40, which then undergoes epoxidation (e.g., m-chloroperbenzoic acid) to give the epoxide-alcohol 41. Acid-mediated intramolecular epoxide ring-opening with the alcohol provides the oxabicyclo[2.2.2] alcohol intermediate 42, which is then subjected to a 1,4-conjugate addition to an appropriate acrylate ester as described in Scheme 3 to give the 3-oxy-ester 43, which is then deprotected to provide the desired 3-oxy-carboxylic acid analogs 44. [00118] The synthesis of the corresponding 2-oxyacetic carboxylic acid analogs 47 is shown in Scheme 12. Oxidation of the intermediate alcohol 42 provides the aldehyde 43, which successively undergoes a Wittig reaction to give alkene 44, followed by hydroboration of the alkene 44 to give the alcohol 45. Reaction of alcohol 45 with an appropriate a-haloacetate ester in the presence of base (as described above in Scheme 4) provides the 2-oxy-ester 46. Deprotection of ester 46 then provides the desired 2-oxyacetic carboxylic acid analogs 47. [00119] Scheme 13 shows the synthesis of a,p-cyclopropyl carboxylic acid analogs 49 and the corresponding Z-a,p-unsaturated carboxylic acid analogs 50. Aldehyde 26 is treated with the bis-trifluoroethyl phosphonate Homer-Emmons reagent (Reference: Still, W.C. et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 24:4405 (1983)) under standard basic conditions to provide selectively the Z-a,p-unsaturated esters 48. The a,p-unsaturated ester 48 is reacted with diazomethane (in the same manner as described in Schemes 8-10) to give the a,p-cyclopropyl ester, which is then deprotected to give the corresponding α,βcyclopropyl acid analogs 49. Alternatively, deprotection of ester 48 provides the desired Z-a,p-unsaturated carboxylic acid analogs 50. [00120] Scheme 14 shows the synthesis of functionalized aryl a,p-cyclopropyl carboxylic acid analogs 55 and 56. The protected hydroxyaryl tosylate 15 is reacted with cyanide, after which the resulting nitrile product is reduced to the corresponding primary alcohol 51. Alcohol 51 is converted to the aldehyde 52 using the same sequence as described in Scheme 8 (for the conversion of 12 to 26). Horner-Emmons reaction of aldehyde 52 with a standard diethyl phosphonate provides the E-a,p-unsaturated ester 53, which is converted to the corresponding a,p-cyclopropyl ester with diazomethane, followed by deprotection to give the phenol-ester 54. Phenol 54 then undergoes an O-arylation reaction (e.g., Chan-Lam coupling with aryl boronic acids) followed by ester deprotection to give the O-aryl a,p-cyclopropyl carboxylic acids 55. Alternatively, phenol 54 is alkylated with appropriate alkyl halides (R5X) under basic conditions followed by ester deprotection to give the O-alkyl a,p-cyclopropyl carboxylic acids 56. Scheme 14 Α/ OTs 43 Q OPG 15 1) NaCN 2) Reduction 3) Reduction to alcohol e.g. DIBALH [00121] Scheme 15 shows the synthesis of diol analogs 58 and 60. Copper-catalyzed coupling of allyl Grignard reagent with iodide 22 (reference: Sai, Μ., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 82:1194 (2009)) provides the terminal alkene 57, which is reacted with osmium tetroxide to give the diol analogs 58. Alternatively, ester 23 is reduced to the corresponding alcohol, then oxidized to the aldehyde and reacted with a standard Wittig reagent to give alkenes 59. Osmylation of alkenes 59 provides the diol analogs 60. [00122] Scheme 16 shows the synthesis of amide analogs 61 from carboxylic acid analogs such as 7 by using standard coupling reaction conditions such as EDCI/HOBT. Scheme 16 [00123] Scheme 17 shows the synthesis of more highly functionalized aryl-substituted oxyacetic acid analogs 63 and 65. The phenol ester intermediate 17 is converted to the triflate 61, which in turn is treated with bis(pinacolato)boronate under palladium catalysis to give the pinacol boronate 62 (e.g., as described in US 2011/152246 Al). Aryl boronate 62 undergoes a palladium-mediated coupling reaction with thiophenols (e.g., as described in WO 2010/51030 Al) to give, after ester deprotection, the aryl thioether analogs 63. Alternatively, the pinacol boronate 62 is hydrolyzed under standard conditions (e.g., as described in WO 2009/63061 Α2) to give boronic acid 64; this intermediate undergoes other functionalization reactions, such as Cu-mediated trifluoromethylation using sodium trifluoromethanesulfinate in the presence of /-BuOOH (e.g., as described in Ye, Υ. et al, Org. Lett., 14:4979 (2012)), followed by ester deprotection, to give the corresponding trifluoromethyl-aryl analogs 65. [0001] Scheme 18 shows the synthesis of hydroxamic acid analogs 66 and 67. Acids 13 and 30 are coupled under standard conditions with a protected hydroxylamine derivative (e.g. tetrahydropyranyl ether), and the protecting group is removed (e.g. mild acid) to provide the corresponding hydroxamic acid analogs 66 and 67. [0002] Scheme 19 shows the synthesis of 6-oxy-a^-cyclopropyl acid analogs 72. Alcohol 8 is oxidized to aldehyde 68. Aldehyde 68 is then converted to the corresponding peroxide and undergoes a copper-mediated fragmentation in the presence of an N-oxy free radical (e.g. TEMPO) to provide alkoxyamine 69 (reference: J. Org. Chem., 74:1567-1573 (2007)). Alkoxyamine 69 is then reduced (Ν-0 bond reductive cleavage) to give the bridgehead alcohol intermediate 70, which then undergoes alkylation with a protected 4-bromobut-2-enoate ester to provide the a^-unsaturated ester 71. Cyclopropanation using trimethylsulfoxonium ylide followed by deprotection furnished the 5-oxy-a^-cyclopropyl acid analogs 72. [0003] Scheme 20 shows an alternative synthesis of acid analogs 47 and 74. The alkenyl alcohol 40 is treated with a halogenating agent (e.g. N-bromosuccinimide) in the presence of water to give a mixture of the corresponding bromohydrin diastereomers 73, which is treated under basic conditions to give the corresponding epoxide diastereomers 41. Epoxides 41 are treated under acidic conditions to provide the intermediate alcohol 42. Alcohol 42 is then converted to oxyacetic acid analogs 47 according to the procedures previously described in Scheme 12. Alternatively, alcohol 42 is converted to the homologated alcohol 45 according to the procedures described in Scheme 12, then to the a^-cyclopropyl acid analogs 74. [0004] Scheme 21 shows the synthesis of acid analogs 76. Alcohol 45 is homologated using a sequence similar to that described in Scheme 4. Alcohol 45 is reacted with mesyl chloride to give the corresponding mesylate, which is then displaced with cyanide, followed by successive reductions to give first the corresponding aldehyde, then finally alcohol 75. Alcohol 75 is then reacted with an appropriate bromoacetate ester and then deprotected to furnish acid analogs 76. IV. BIOLOGY [0005] Diabetes mellitus is a serious disease afflicting over 100 million people worldwide. It is diagnosed as a group of disorders characterized by abnormal glucose homeostasis resulting in elevated blood glucose. Diabetes is a syndrome with interrelated metabolic, vascular, and neuropathic components. The metabolic abnormality is generally characterized by hyperglycemia and alterations in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism caused by absent or reduced insulin secretion and/or ineffective insulin secretion. The vascular syndrome consists of abnormalities in the blood vessels leading to cardiovascular, retinal and renal complications. Abnormalities in the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems are also part of diabetic syndrome. Strikingly, diabetes is the fourth leading cause of global death by disease, the largest cause of kidney failure in developed countries, the leading cause of vision loss in industrialized countries and has the greatest prevalence increase in developing countries. [0006] Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 90% of diabetes cases, is characterized by increasing insulin resistance associated with inadequate insulin secretion after a period of compensatory hyperinsulinemia. The reasons for β cell secondary failure are not completely understood. Acquired pancreatic islet damage or exhaustion and/or genetic factors causing susceptibility to islet secretory insufficiency have been hypothesized. [0007] Recently, five GPCRs (FFAR1 (GPR40), FFAR2 (GPR43), FFAR3 (GPR41), GPR84, and GPR120) were reported to recognize free fatty acids FFAR1, recognizes medium-long chainfatty acids like palmitic acid and linoleic acid FFAR2 and FFAR3 recognize short-chain fatty acids like acetate and butyrate whereas GPR84 recognizes medium-chain fatty acid like lauric acid. GPR120 recognizes long-chain fatty acids, especially ΕΡΑ and DHA (Im, D.S., Prog. Lipid Res., 51:232-237 (2012)). GPR120 has been detected in macrophages, dendritic cells, adipocytes, clara cells in bronchiole epithelium, and enteroendocrine L cells in colon (Miyauchi et al., Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol., 379:427-434 (2009)). The anti-inflammatory mechanism of omega-3 fatty acids using GPR120 knock-out mice was investigated (Oh et al., Cell, 142:687-698 (2010)). They suggested GPR120 activation by DHA interacts with ΤΑΒ1 via b-arrestin-2, and that this interaction interrupts ΤΑΚ1 activation by LPS or TNF-alpha, suppressing inflammatory responses via NF-kB and JNK in macrophages and dendritic cells (Oh et al., Cell, 142:687-698 (2010)). Furthermore, GPR120 activation was shown to enhance insulin-induced glucose uptake in adipose tissues through Gq/11 proteins and PI 3-kinase. [0008] Similarly, GPR 120-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet develop obesity, glucose intolerance and fatty liver with decreased adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis and enhanced hepatic lipogenesis (Ichimura et al, Nature, 483(7389):350-354 (2012). Insulin resistance in such mice was shown to be associated with reduced insulin signalling and enhanced inflammation in adipose tissue. In humans, GPR120 expression in adipose tissue was shown to be significantly higher in obese individuals than in lean controls. GPR 120 gene sequencing in obese subjects revealed a deleterious non-synonymous mutation (p.R270H) that inhibits GPR120 signalling activity. Furthermore, the p.R270H variant was associated with increased risk of obesity in European populations. [0009] Given the increase in the worldwide patient population afflicted by type 2 diabetes, there is a need for novel therapies which are effective with minimal adverse events. To decrease medical burden of type 2 diabetes through enhanced glycemic control, GPR120 modulator compounds of the present invention are being investigated here for their ability to increase glucose tolerance as well as the potential combination with a broad range of anti-diabetic drugs. [0010] The term "modulator" refers to a chemical compound with capacity to either enhance (e.g., "agonist" activity) or partially enhance (e.g., "partial agonist" activity) or inhibit (e.g., "antagonist" activity or "inverse agonist" activity) a functional property of biological activity or process (e.g., enzyme activity or receptor binding); such enhancement or inhibition may be contingent on the occurrence of a specific event, such as activation of a signal transduction pathway, receptor internalization, and/or may be manifest only in particular cell types. [0011] It is also desirable and preferable to find compounds with advantageous and improved characteristics compared with known anti-diabetic agents, in one or more of the following categories that are given as examples, and are not intended to be limiting: (a) pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability, half life, and clearance; (b) pharmaceutical properties; (c) dosage requirements; (d) factors that decrease blood drug concentration peak-to-trough characteristics; (℮) factors that increase the concentration of active drug at the receptor; (f) factors that decrease the liability for clinical drug-drug interactions; (g) factors that decrease the potential for adverse side-effects, including selectivity versus other biological targets; and (h) improved therapeutic index with less propensity for hypoglycemia. [0012] As used herein, the term "patient" encompasses all mammalian species. [0013] As used herein, the term "subject" refers to any human or non-human organism that could potentially benefit from treatment with a GPR120 modulator. Exemplary subjects include human beings of any age with risk factors for metabolic disease. Common risk factors include, but are not limited to, age, sex, weight, family history, or signs of insulin resistance such as acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dislipidemia, or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). [0014] As used herein, "treating" or "treatment" cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting it development; (b) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state; and/or (c) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it. [0015] As used herein, “preventing” or "prevention" cover the preventive treatment (i.e., prophylaxis and/or risk reduction) of a subclinical disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, aimed at reducing the probability of the occurrence of a clinical disease-state. Patients are selected for preventative therapy based on factors that are known to increase risk of suffering a clinical disease state compared to the general population. "Prophylaxis" therapies can be divided into (a) primary prevention and (b) secondary prevention. Primary prevention is defined as treatment in a subject that has not yet presented with a clinical disease state, whereas secondary prevention is defined as preventing a second occurrence of the same or similar clinical disease state. As used herein, "risk reduction" covers therapies that lower the incidence of development of a clinical disease state. As such, primary and secondary prevention therapies are examples of risk reduction. [0016] "Therapeutically effective amount" is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention that is effective when administered alone or in combination to modulate GPR120 and/or to prevent or treat the disorders listed herein. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the preventive or therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously. [0017] GPR120 activity was monitored by measuring phosphorylation of ERK (pERK), since G protein receptors are known to activate the ERK signaling cascade either directly and/or through recruitment of arrestin that serves as a scaffold for downstream signaling events. Molecules that activated GPR120 with sufficient potency and efficacy in the pERK assay that also possessed desirable pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated in mice for glucose lowering by monitoring disposition of an oral glucose load by an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT). GPR120 pERK AlphaScreen SureFire Assay [0018] The human and mouse GPR120-mediated intracellular phosphorylated ERK assays were established using CHOA12 cells stably transfected with the short form of human or mouse GPR120 receptor. Cells were cultured in growth medium consisting of F-12 media (Invitrogen Cat. #11765) with 5% Charcoal/Dextran FBS (Invitrogen Cat. #12676-029), 500pg/mL GENETICIN® (Life Technologies Cat. #10131-027) and 250pg/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen Cat. #R250-01). Cells were cryo preserved at a concentration of2χ107 cells/mL, in 90% Charcoal/Dextran FBS and 10% DMSO, and frozen in liquid nitrogen at a low passage number. [0019] For the pERK assay, 2χ107 cells/mL cryopreserved human and mouse cells were thawed rapidly in a 37 °C water bath and added to a T-225 flask containing 50 mL growth medium. The flasks were placed in a tissue culture incubator overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2). The next day, cells were harvested with trypsin (Gibco Cat. #25300-054), resuspended in serum-containing growth medium and counted using a Cellometer and volume adjusted to a concentration of 0.6xl06cells/mL. Cells were plated into 384-well clear bottom tissue culture plates (BD Cat. #353962) at 50 pL/well, for a density of 30,000 cells/well using a MULTIDROP® and incubated for 16-18 hours (overnight) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The next day, cells were serum starved in 30 pL of F-12 media without any serum or antibiotics for 2 hours at 37 °C. [0020] Test compounds were 3-fold, 11-point serially diluted in DMSO in a REMP assay plate (Matrix Cat. #4307) by Tecan and 5 pL was transferred into an ECHO source plate (LABCYTE® Cat. #LC-0200). Cells were then stimulated with 50 nL of compound dilutions using ECHO liquid handler for 7 minutes at 37 °C. Compounds ranged from final assay concentrations of 33.33 μΜ to 0.56 ηΜ. [0021] The media was then dumped and cells lysed with 20 pL of IX Lysis buffer from the AlphaScreen SureFire Phospho-ERK 1/2 Kit (Perkin Elmer Cat. #6760617Μ). The lysis buffer was diluted 5-fold with water before use. The plate was agitated on a shaker for 10 minutes after which 2 pL was transferred into a 384-well white proxiplate (Perkin Elmer Cat. #6008289). The SureFire assay reagent mix was prepared by mixing 60 parts Reaction Buffer, 10 parts Activation Buffer, 1 part Donor Beads, 1 part Acceptor Beads (Perkin Elmer Cat. #TGRES10K). 3.5 pL/well of this reagent mix was manually added to the proxiplate with a multichannel pipettor. Plates were spun down at 1000 rpm for 2 minutes, followed by light-protected incubation at room temperature for 2 hours. The plates were read on the Alpha-technology compatible Envision multilabel plate reader using AlphaScreen protocol according to manufacturer's specifications. The agonist effect of compounds was expressed as 100 χ (average sample-average blank)/(average total- average blank) where sample is the luminescence activity in the presence of test compound, blank is equal to the luminescence activity in the presence of DMSO control and the total is signal induced by 50 μΜ linolenic acid as reference compound. Activation data for the test compound over a range of concentrations was plotted as percentage activation of the test compound (100% = maximum response). After correcting for background, EC5q values were determined. The EC5q is defined as the concentration of test compound which produces 50% of the maximal response and was quantified using the 4 parameter logistic equation to fit the data. [0022] The human and mouse GPR120-mediated intracellular phosphorylated ERK assays were also established using CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with the short form of human or mouse GPR120 receptor. Cells were cultured in growth medium consisting of F-12 media (Invitrogen Cat. #11765) with 5% Charcoal/Dextran FBS (Invitrogen Cat. #12676-029) and 500pg/mL GENETICIN® (Life Technologies Cat. #10131-027). Cells were cryo preserved at a concentration of 3χ106 cells/mL, in 70% F-12, 20% Charcoal/Dextran FBS and 10% DMSO, and frozen in liquid nitrogen at a low passage number. [0023] For the pERK assay, 3χ106 cells/mL cryopreserved human and mouse cells were thawed rapidly in a 37 °C water bath and added to a T-225 flask containing 50 mL growth medium. The flasks were placed in a tissue culture incubator overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2). The next day, cells were harvested with trypsin (Gibco Cat. #25300-054), resuspended in serum-containing growth medium and counted using a Cellometer and volume adjusted to a concentration of 0.5xl06cells/mL. Cells were plated into 384-well clear bottom tissue culture plates (BD Cat. #353962) at 50 pL/well, for a density of 25,000 cells/well using a MULTIDROP® and incubated for 16-18 hours (overnight) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The next day, cells were washed once with 50 pL of PBS without Ca++/Mg++ (Gibco Cat. #14190-036) and serum starved in 25 pL of F-12 media without any serum or antibiotics for 2 hours at 37 °C. [0024] Test compounds were 3-fold, 11-point serially diluted in DMSO in a REMP assay plate (Matrix Cat. #4307) by Tecan and 5 pL was transferred into an ECHO source plate (LABCYTE® Cat. #LC-0200). Cells were then stimulated with 40 nL of compound dilutions using ECHO liquid handler for 7 minutes at 37 °C. Compounds ranged from final assay concentrations of 32 ρΜ to 0.54 ηΜ. [0025] The media was then dumped and cells lysed with 20 pL of IX Lysis buffer from the AlphaScreen SureFire Phospho-ERK 1/2 Kit (Perkin Elmer Cat. #6760617Μ). The lysis buffer was diluted 5-fold with water before use.

At approximately 11 weeks age, after a 5 h fast, these mice were orally treated with vehicle or test compounds 60 min before a glucose challenge (2 g/kg). Blood glucose levels were determined from tail bleeds taken at -60, 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after the glucose challenge. The blood glucose excursion profde from t = 0-120 min was used to calculate an area under the curve (AUC) for compound treatment. This AUC for compound treatment is compared to vehicle treatment. [0029] In an oral glucose tolerance test in mice at dose of 30 mg/kg, Examples 6, 14 and 80 reduced glucose AUC levels by 40%, 30% and 60% respectively. 2) Acute Intraperitoneal Insulin Tolerance Test [0030] C57BL/6 mice were housed individually and fed a standard rodent chow diet. At approximately 11 weeks age, after 5 h fast, these mice were orally treated with vehicle or test compounds 30 min before an insulin challenge (0.1 U/kg). Blood glucose levels were determined from tail bleeds taken at -30, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after insulin injection. The blood glucose excursion profile from t = 0-120 min was used to calculate a negative area under the curve (AUC) for compound treatment. This AUC for compound treatment is compared to vehicle treatment. [0031] The compounds of the present invention possess activity as modulators of GPR120, and, therefore, may be used in the treatment of diseases associated with GPR120 activity. Via modulation of GPR120, the compounds of the present invention may preferably be employed to modulate the production/secretion of insulin and/or gut hormones, such as GLP-1, GIP, ΡΥΥ, CCK and amylin. [0032] Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention can be administered to mammals, preferably humans, for the treatment of a variety of conditions and disorders, including, but not limited to, treating, preventing, or slowing the progression of diabetes and related conditions, microvascular complications associated with diabetes, macrovascular complications associated with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, Metabolic Syndrome and its component conditions, inflammatory diseases and other maladies. Consequently, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention may be used in preventing, inhibiting, or treating diabetes, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, diabetic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, cardiorenal syndrome, delayed wound healing, atherosclerosis and its sequelae (acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral vascular disease, intermittent claudication, myocardial ischemia, stroke, heart failure), Metabolic Syndrome, hypertension, obesity, fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL, high LDL, lipid disorders, lipodystrophy, liver diseases such as NASH (Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis), NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) and liver cirrhosis, and treatment of side-effects related to diabetes. [0033] Metabolic Syndrome or "Syndrome X" is described in Ford et al., J. Am. Med. Assoc., 287:356-359 (2002) and Arbeeny et al., Curr. Med. Chem. - Imm., Endoc. & Metab. Agents, 1:1-24(2001). V. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS, FORMULATIONS AND COMBINATIONS [0034] The compounds of this invention can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, orally, such as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions (including nanosuspensions, microsuspensions, spray-dried dispersions), syrups, and emulsions; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions); nasally, including administration to the nasal membranes, such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; or rectally such as in the form of suppositories. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. [0035] The term "pharmaceutical composition" means a composition comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals, including, ℓ℮., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fdlers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. [0036] Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, Allen, L.V., Jr. et al., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2 Volumes), 22nd Edition, Pharmaceutical Press (2012). [0037] The dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. [0038] By way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.001 to about 5000 mg per day, preferably between about 0.01 to about 1000 mg per day, and most preferably between about 0.1 to about 250 mg per day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. [0039] The compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, e.g., oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, and syrups, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. [0040] Dosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 2000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.1-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. [0041] A typical capsule for oral administration contains at least one of the compounds of the present invention (250 mg), lactose (75 mg), and magnesium stearate (15 mg). The mixture is passed through a 60 mesh sieve and packed into a No. 1 gelatin capsule. [0042] A typical injectable preparation is produced by aseptically placing at least one of the compounds of the present invention (250 mg) into a vial, aseptically freeze-drying and sealing. For use, the contents of the vial are mixed with 2 mL of physiological saline, to produce an injectable preparation. [0043] The present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present invention, alone or in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier. Optionally, compounds of the present invention can be used alone, in combination with other compounds of the invention, or in combination with one or more other therapeutic agent(s), e.g., an antidiabetic agent or other pharmaceutically active material. [0044] The compounds of the present invention may be employed in combination with other GPR120 modulators or one or more other suitable therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of the aforementioned disorders including: anti-diabetic agents, anti-hyperglycemic agents, anti-hyperinsulinemic agents, anti-retinopathic agents, anti-neuropathic agents, anti-nephropathic agents, anti-atherosclerotic agents, anti-ischemic agents, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-obesity agents, anti-dyslipidemic agents, anti-hyperlipidemic agents, anti-hypertriglyceridemic agents, anti-hypercholesterolemic agents, anti-restenotic agents, anti-pancreatitis agents, lipid lowering agents, anorectic agents, appetite suppressants, treatments for heart failure, treatments for peripheral arterial disease and anti-inflammatory agents. [0045] Where desired, the compound of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other types of antidiabetic agents and/or one or more other types of therapeutic agents which may be administered orally in the same dosage form, in a separate oral dosage form or by injection. The other type of antidiabetic agent that may be optionally employed in combination with the GPR120 receptor modulator of the present invention may be one, two, three or more antidiabetic agents or antihyperglycemic agents which may be administered orally in the same dosage form, in a separate oral dosage form, or by injection to produce an additional pharmacological benefit. [0046] The antidiabetic agents used in the combination with the compound of the present invention include, but are not limited to, insulin secretagogues or insulin sensitizers, other GPR120 receptor modulators, or other antidiabetic agents. These agents include, but are not limited to, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP4) inhibitors (for example, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin. alogliptin, vildagliptin), biguanides (for example, metformin, phenformin), sulfonyl ureas (for example, gliburide, glimepiride, glipizide), glucosidase inhibitors (for example, acarbose, miglitol), PPARy agonists such as thiazolidinediones (for example, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), PPAR α/γ dual agonists (for example, muraglitazar, peliglitazar, tesaglitazar, aleglitazar), glucokinase activators (e.g., PF-04937319 and AMG-151, as well as other compounds described in Fyfe, M.C.T. et al, Drugs of the Future, 3 4(8): 641-65 3 (2009) and incorporated herein by reference), GPR40 receptor modulators (e.g., TAK-875), GPR119 receptor modulators (e.g., ΜΒΧ-2952, PSN821, APD597), other GPR120 receptor modulators (e.g, compound 43 from J. Med. Chem., 55:4511-4515 (2012)), sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (for example dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, remagliflozin), 11 p-HSD-1 inhibitors (for example MK-0736, BI35585, BMS-823778, and LY2523199), amylin analogs such as pramlintide, and/or insulin. Reviews of current and emerging therapies for the treatment of diabetes can be found in: Mohler, M.L. et al., Medicinal Research Reviews, 29(1): 125-195 (2009), and Mizuno, C.S. et al., Current Medicinal Chemistry, 15:61-74 (2008). [0047] The GPR120 receptor modulator of the present invention may also be optionally employed in combination with agents for treating complication of diabetes. These agents include PKC inhibitors and/or AGE inhibitors. [0048] The GPR120 receptor modulator of the present invention way also be optionally employed in combination with one or more hypophagic agents such as diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, phentermine, orlistat, sibutramine, lorcaserin, pramlintide, topiramate, MCHR1 receptor antagonists, oxyntomodulin, naltrexone, Amylin peptide, ΝΡΥ Υ5 receptor modulators, ΝΡΥ Υ2 receptor modulators, ΝΡΥ Υ4 receptor modulators, cetilistat, 5HT2c receptor modulators, MGAT2 (monoacylglycerol transferase 2) inhibitors (for example, compounds from WO 2012/124744, or compound (S)-10 from Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2013), doi: http://dx.doi.Org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.02.084) and the like. The compound of structure I may also be employed in combination with an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1 R), such as exenatide, liraglutide, GLP-l(l-36) amide, GLP-1(7-36) amide, GLP-1 (7-37) (as disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 5,614,492 to Habener, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference), which may be administered via injection, intranasal, or by transdermal or buccal devices. Reviews of current and emerging therapies for the treatment of obesity can be found in: Melnikova, I. et al, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 5:369-370 (2006); Jones, D., Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery, 8:833-834 (2009); Obici, S., Endocrinology, 150(6):2512-2517 (2009); and Elangbam, C.S., Vet. Pathol., 46(1): 10-24 (2009). [0049] The above other therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention may be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physicians' Desk Reference, as in the patents set out above, or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. [0050] Particularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason, when the compound of the present invention and a second therapeutic agent are combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a material that affects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component. [0051] These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure. [0052] The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. By "administered in combination" or "combination therapy" it is meant that the compound of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic agents are administered concurrently to the mammal being treated. When administered in combination, each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time. Thus, each component may be administered separately but sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect. [0053] The compounds of the present invention are also useful as standard or reference compounds, for example as a quality standard or control, in tests or assays involving the GPR120 receptor. Such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving GPR120 or anti-diabetic activity. For example, a compound of the present invention could be used as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. This would ensure the experimentor that the assay was being performed properly and provide a basis for comparison, especially if the test compound was a derivative of the reference compound. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness. [0054] The compounds of the present invention may also be used in diagnostic assays involving GPR120. [0055] The present invention also encompasses an article of manufacture. As used herein, article of manufacture is intended to include, but not be limited to, kits and packages. The article of manufacture of the present invention, comprises: (a) a first container; (b) a pharmaceutical composition located within the first container, wherein the composition, comprises: a first therapeutic agent, comprising a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form thereof; and, (c) a package insert stating that the pharmaceutical composition can be used for the treatment of multiple diseases or disorders associated with GPR120 (as defined previously). In another embodiment, the package insert states that the pharmaceutical composition can be used in combination (as defined previously) with a second therapeutic agent for the treatment of multiple diseases or disorders associated with GPR120. The article of manufacture can further comprise: (d) a second container, wherein components (a) and (b) are located within the second container and component (c) is located within or outside of the second container. Located within the first and second containers means that the respective container holds the item within its boundaries. [0056] The first container is a receptacle used to hold a pharmaceutical composition. This container can be for manufacturing, storing, shipping, and/or individual/bulk selling. First container is intended to cover a bottle, jar, vial, flask, syringe, tube (e.g., for a cream preparation), or any other container used to manufacture, hold, store, or distribute a pharmaceutical product. [0057] The second container is one used to hold the first container and, optionally, the package insert. Examples of the second container include, but are not limited to, boxes (e.g., cardboard or plastic), crates, cartons, bags (e.g., paper or plastic bags), pouches, and sacks. The package insert can be physically attached to the outside of the first container via tape, glue, staple, or another method of attachment, or it can rest inside the second container without any physical means of attachment to the first container. Alternatively, the package insert is located on the outside of the second container. When located on the outside of the second container, it is preferable that the package insert is physically attached via tape, glue, staple, or another method of attachment. Alternatively, it can be adjacent to or touching the outside of the second container without being physically attached. [0058] The package insert is a label, tag, marker, etc. that recites information relating to the pharmaceutical composition located within the first container. The information recited will usually be determined by the regulatory agency governing the area in which the article of manufacture is to be sold (e.g., the United States Food and Drug Administration). Preferably, the package insert specifically recites the indications for which the pharmaceutical composition has been approved. The package insert may be made of any material on which a person can read information contained therein or thereon. Preferably, the package insert is a printable material (e.g., paper, plastic, cardboard, foil, adhesive-backed paper or plastic, etc.) on which the desired information has been formed (e.g., printed or applied). [0059] Other features of the invention will become apparent in the course of the following descriptions of exemplary embodiments that are given for illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof.
