The present invention relates to a pre-etching composition for the treatment of non-conductive substrates in a plating process for the deposition of a metal layer on the substrate surface. More specifically, the invention relates to an aqueous pre-etching composition for a plastic substrate, like e.g. an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a polycarbonate (PC), polyetherimide (PEI), or a blend of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and a polycarbonate (PC). The invention further relates to a process of etching a non-conductive substrate surface prior to a metal plating step. Coating of non-conductive substrate surfaces, like e.g. plastic surfaces, with a metal coating is a practice that is variously used for affecting the surface properties of substrates. Non-conductive surfaces are frequently coated with suitable metal layers either for technical reasons or for decorative reasons. For example, metallization, i.e. coating of a surface with a metal layer, of non-conductive surface to render such surfaces electrically conductive is widely used in the field of manufacturing integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, or other electric or electronic components. Furthermore, substrate surfaces are coated for decorative reasons with a metal layer having corresponding optical or haptical characteristics. Especially in the field of automotive decoratively metalized plastic surfaces are widely spread. In the domain of electric and electronic engineering conductive structures are deposited for instance on plastic boards to set up integrated circuits by means of suitable metal deposition processes. For the durability of the metal layers deposited on the plastic substrate surfaces it is decisive that the same exhibit sufficient adhesion on the substrate surface. To provide a corresponding ED 40284 / UAM:UA adhering strength, it is common practice in the art of metal plating to roughen the relevant surfaces of a plastic substrate prior to a metal deposition. For this purpose different processes are known from the state of the art. In the state of the art such processes are also referred to as etching or pickling of the surface. The etching processes known from the art are both, chromium-(VI) free processes and chromium-(VI)-containing processes. Both kinds of processes are based on an oxidative decomposition of moieties of the plastic surface, like e.g. butadiene moieties in an ABS or ABS-blend plastic material, whereby caverns are formed on the surface. These caverns function as a fixture to a subsequent deposited metal coating. For example, WO2005094394 discloses a process for preparing a non-conductive substrate for subsequent metallization. Here, a plastic surface is etched with a etching solution comprising a permanganate and a mineral acid. US 7,025,867 discloses the treatment of a plastic surface with an acidic permanganate solution prior to direct electrolytic metallization of an electrically non-conductive substrate surface. The German patent DE 197 40 431 C1 discloses an etching step in the metallization of an electrically non-conductive surface area in which the substrate surface is treated with an acidic etching solution containing a hydrogen peroxide. The acid in the acidic solution may be phosphoric acid. The German patent application DE 100 54 544 discloses an etching process for plastic substrate surfaces by means of a solution containing chromate ions. The mixture contains chromium trioxide and concentrated sulfuric acid. The European patent EP 1 785 507 discloses an etching method for non-conductive substrate surface in which an etching solution containing a halogenide or nitrate of the group consisting of Na, Mg, Al, Si, Sc, Ti, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn and a soluble coordinative compound of the general formula M1(HF2) is used. WO2009/023628 discloses an etching solution for the surface pre-treatment of a plastic surface in preparation of a subsequent metallization, the solution comprising a source of Mn(VIII) ions and an inorganic acid, wherein the pickling solution is substantially free of chromium (VI) ions, alkali ions, and alkaline-earth ions. In US 5332465 A process is disclosed which is employed in sensitizing plastic surfaces prior to etching which sensitization enhances the coverage and adhesiveness of the subsequent plate. The composition and process proposed use Limonene, solutions of Limonene and Emulsions of Limonene for the sensitizer. US 5271773 A disclose a composition and process for cleaning articles contaminated with water insoluble contaminants. The process allows for recycling of components in the system. The wash solution effectively cleans water insoluble contaminants and, upon settling, quickly releases contaminants from the wash solution. US 4006269 disclose a method for sensitizing a substrate of non-conductive material for the deposition thereon of a conductive film of copper or nickel comprises the steps of applying to the substrate a substance which can photochemically abstract a hydrogen atom from a hydrogen donor in the presence of a suitable solvent, and subsequently immersing the sensitized substrate in a solution containing certain metal ions such as copper, nickel or silver, and simultaneously exposing the sensitized substrate to radiation from an ultraviolet light source. As one can see from the above, different approaches for etching non-conductive surface prior to a metallization are known from the state of the art. However, chromium-(VI)-compounds are under suspicion of being possible carcinogenic so that handling of those compounds is subject to governmental regulations of environmentalism and a prohibition of commercial use of such compounds cannot be ruled out in general. Acidic chromium-free etching solutions based on permanganate show a rapid self-reactivity and decomposition. This results in a relatively short lifetime of such etching solutions. Alkaline manganese etching solutions have a reasonable stability and are environmental friendly, however, the etching capability especially on plastic substrates, like e.g. ABS, PC, PEI, or ABS/PC blends, is not very strong so that relative long treatment times are needed. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a composition to enhance the etching of non-conductive plastic substrate surfaces in a plating process for the deposition of a metal layer. It is another object of the invention to provide an enhanced process for etching non-conductive plastic substrate surface in a plating process for the deposition of a metal layer. With respect to the solution, the object of the invention is solved by a pre-etching composition according to claim 1. Thus, an aqueous pre-etching composition for the treatment of non-conductive substrates in a plating process for the deposition of a metal layer on a substrate surface is provided, wherein the pre-etching composition contains at least one water soluble solvent, wherein the composition contains at least one compound selected from the group consisting of terpenes phenylpropanoides, isovanillin and vanillin characterized in that the composition additionally contains at least one solvent selected from the group consisting of 2-methylpentanedioic acid dimethyl ester, isopentyl diol, 6,6-dimethyl bicyclo-(3,1,1)-2-heptene-2-ethanol, and ethylacetoacetate. Surprisingly it was found that a pre-etching composition comprising a water soluble solvent and a terpene and/or a phenylpropanoid and/or vanillin and/or isovanillin is capable to swell a substrate surface of a non-conductive plastic substrate, especially of a substrate made from ABS, PC, PEI, and/or ABS/PC blend. It was found that due to the swelling of the substrate surface a subsequently applied etching solution shows an increased etching capability. This enables the use of less aggressive and more environmental friendly etching solutions, like e.g. alkaline manganese etching solutions. On the other hand, when using commonly known etching solutions, like e.g. chromic acid etching solutions or acidic manganese etching solutions, the treatment time for achieving an appropriate etching result, i.e. an appropriate roughened surface, can significantly be reduced. By such reduction of treatment time the overall efficiency of the plating process can be increased. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the aqueous pre-etching composition contains a solvent which is selected from the group consisting of glycols and their derivates, for example dipropylene glycol, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol, Diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (Diglyme), triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (triglyme), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (tatraglyme), dipropylene glycol dimethyl ether (proglyme), polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (polyglyme), also several solvents like soluble alcohols, ethers, esters, for example isopentyle diole, 3-methoxy-3-methylbutan-1-ol or its acetate, Butyro-1.4-lacton, 1.3-dioxacyclopentan, 4-methyl-1.3-dioxacyclopentan or a mixture of these. It was found that, in combination with the a terpene and/or a phenylpropanoid, such solvents are especially capable to provide an aqueous pre-etching composition which is capable to swell the surface of a non-conductive plastic substrate, like e.g. a substrate made from ABS, PC, PEI, or an ABS/PC blend, in such way that in a subsequent etching step a efficiently roughened surface can be achieved, which enhances the adhesion of the subsequent deposited metal layer. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the terpene is at least one compound selected from the group consisting of acyclic monoterpenes, monocyclic terpenes, bicyclic monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and triterpenes. Surprisingly, it was found that such compounds a well suitable to increase the swelling of a plastic substrate surface prior to an etching step. Especially, where the terpene is at least one compound selected from the group consisting of citrale, myrcene, geraniol, citronellal, citronellol, 1,8-cineole, carvone, phellandrene, α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, camphene, 3-carene, terpinolene, bornyl acetate, menthol, menthone, citronellol, nerol, linalool, farnesol, rhodinol, sabinene, borneole, isoborneole, α-terpineol, β-terpineol, γ-terpineol, δ-terpineol, trans-verbenol, cis-verbenol, isovaleric acid, and Gibberellic acid it was found that the pre-etching composition has a good swelling activity on non-conductive plastic substrate surfaces, like e.g. substrates made from ABS, PC, PEI, or an ABS/PC blend. Furthermore, according to another embodiment of the invention, the phenylpropanoid has a structure according to the general formula I wherein R1 = C3H5,C3H3O, or C3H5O, R2 = H, OCH3, OH, and R3 = H, OH, OCH3, COOCH3, wherein at least R1 differs from R2 or R3, or R2 and R3 It was found that also such phenylpropanoidic structures as represented in the general formula I are capable to achieve an appropriate swelling of a plastic surface prior to an etching of said surface. However, while not to be bound to this theory, it is believed that the isoprene substructures comprised in both, the terpenes and the phenylpropanoids, is responsible for the swelling ability of the compounds and for overall pre-etching compositions according to the invention. It is a preferred side effect that most of these terpenes and the phenylpropanoids have delightful odor which makes handling of the composition quite pleasant. Preferably, phenylpropanoids to be used in the pre-etching composition according to the invention are selected from the group consisting of anethole, estragole, eugenole, isoeugenole, methyl eugenole, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, coniferyl alcohol, safrole, apiole, and dillapiole, or combination of these. According to an embodiment of the invention, a combination of at least some of the aforementioned terpenes and/or phenylpropanoids and/or vanillin and/or isovanillin is used, wherein the selection of the terpenes and/or phenylpropanoids is made on basis of their odors with the aim to provide a pre-etching composition having a commonly enjoyable perceived odor. By doing so the pre-etching composition, when used with an etching composition and/or the plating composition in a common workshop, will be capable to compensate and/or gild displeasing odors coming from the other compositions used. This contributes to a friendly working environment. According to an embodiment of the invention, the water soluble solvent is comprised in the composition in a concentration within the range of between 5 Vol.-% and 50 Vol.-%, preferably between 10 Vol.-% and 40 Vol.-%, most preferred between 20 Vol.-% and 40 Vol.-%. It was found that such concentrations are especially suitable to provide a pre-etching solution having good swelling activity on non-conductive substrates, like e.g. substrates made from ABS, PC, PEI, and ABS/PC blends. In another embodiment, the terpenes and/or phenylpropanoids are comprised in pre-etching composition in a concentration of at least 0.005 mol/L, preferably in a concentration within the range between 0.005 mol/L and 1.0 mol/L, more preferred in a concentration within the range between 0.01 mol/L and 0.8 mol/L, even more preferred in a concentration within the range between 0.02 mol/L and 0.5 mol/L, most preferred in a concentration within the range between 0.03 mol/L and 0.3 mol/L. According to another embodiment of the invention, the composition additionally contains at least one solvent selected from the group consisting of 2-methylpentanedioic acid dimethyl ester, isopentyl diol, 6,6-dimethyl bicyclo-(3,1,1)-2-heptene-2-ethanol, and ethylacetoacetate. It was found that the addition of at least one of these solvents additionally increases the swelling activity of the pre-etching composition, so that treatment time can be reduced. Said additionally solvents may be comprised in the inventive pre-etching composition in an overall concentration within the range of between 5 ml/L to 250 ml/L, preferably, 8ml/L to 200 ml/L, most preferred 10ml/L to 180 ml/L. Additionally, according to an embodiment of the invention, the pre-etching composition may contain at least one acid of the group consisting of mineral acid, sulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, carboxylic acid, and salts of the aforementioned acids. It was found that by adding an acid of the aforementioned group to the pre-etching composition the swell activity of the composition is increased. Said acid may be comprised in the pre-etching composition in a concentration within the range of between 1 ml/L to 100 ml/L, preferably 3 ml/L to 50 ml/l, most preferred 5 ml/L to 20 ml/L. The pH value of the pre-etching composition according to the invention may vary in a range of between pH 2 and pH 10. Surprisingly, it was found that the inventive pre-etching composition efficiently can be adjusted to an alkaline pH-value as well as an acidic pH-value. When being adjusted to an alkaline pH-value, a pH-value in the range of pH 8 to 10 is preferred for the inventive pre-etching compositions. Adjustment can be achieved by addition of alkali hydroxides and/or alkaline earth hydroxides, like e.g. NaOH, KOH, Mg(OH)2, or Ca(OH)2. When being adjusted to an acidic pH-value, a pH-value in the range of pH 2 to pH 5 is preferred. Adjustment can be achieved by addition of an appropriate acid, like e.g. a mineral acid like HCl, H3PO4, or a carboxylic acid like e.g. methane sulfonic acid or the like. The inventive pre-etching composition can also be operated at an almost neutral pH-value, preferably in a range of between pH 5 to pH 8. In another aspect the invention relates to process for etching a plastic substrate surface prior to a plating process for the deposition of a metal layer on the substrate surface, the process comprising the steps of a) contacting the substrate surface with an aqueous pre-etching composition according to the invention;b) contacting the pre-etched surface with an alkaline or acidic etching composition. Contacting within the meaning of the invention should be understood as dipping the substrate into the pre-etching composition, spray said composition onto said substrate or any other appropriate way to enable the pre-etching composition get in contact with the surface for swelling it. According to a preferred embodiment of the inventive process, the plastic substrate to be metalized is made from an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a polycarbonate (PC), polyetherimide (PEI), or a blend of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and a polycarbonate (PC). In another embodiment of the inventive process, the substrate surface is contacted with the pre-etching composition for a time between 10s to 10 min., preferably 20s to 5 min., most preferred 30s to 3 min. It was found that even at very short contacting time like, e.g. 10s to 1 min. the plastic surface is swelled sufficiently to enhance the subsequent etching step. According to another embodiment of the invention, the plastic substrate in contacted with the pre-etching composition at a temperature within the range of between 20°C to 100°C, preferably 25°C to 90°C, most preferred between 30°C and 80°C. The process according to the invention may additionally incorporate a rinse step between the pre-etching step and the etching step to avoid contamination of the etching composition with the pre-etching composition. The etching composition used in the etching step of the inventive process may be at least one composition of the group consisting of a chromium sulfuric acid etch, a manganese sulfuric acid etch, an acidic manganese etch, and an alkaline manganese etch. Surprisingly, it was found that the pre-etching composition according to the invention can be used in combination with commonly known etchants, also based on acidic solutions as well as alkaline solutions. Therefore, the inventive pre-etching composition can advantageously be integrated in known plastic plating processes without any major amendment of the plating equipment just by adding an additional pre-plating tank. Integration of the inventive pre-etching in known plating processes enhances the productivity of the overall plating process due to a reduced etching time, while at the same time enhancing the adhesion of the metal layer to the substrate surface. Yet, in another aspect the invention relates to the use of a terpene and/or a phenylpropanoid as a swelling agent in a process of depositing a metal layer on a non-conductive substrate surface. In a preferred embodiment the invention relates to the use of a phenylpropanoid having a structure according to the general formula I wherein R1 = C3H5,C3H3O, or C3H5O, R2 = H, OCH3, OH, and R3 = H, OH, OCH3, COOCH3, wherein at least R1 differs from R2 or R3, or R2 and R3 as a swelling agent in a process of metal deposition on a plastic substrate surface, like e.g. the surface of substrate made from ABS, PC, PEI, or a blend comprising at least one of the aforementioned plastics.

In another embodiment the invention relates to the use of a terpene and/or a phenylpropanoid as a swelling agent in a process of depositing a metal layer on a non-conductive substrate surface in combination with a water soluble solvent. Preferably, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of glycols and their derivates, for example dipropylene glycol (DPG), diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DEG-MBE), diethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (triglyme), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (tatraglyme), dipropylene glycol dimethyl ether (proglyme), polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (polyglyme), also several solvents like soluble alcohols, ethers, esters, for example isopentyle diole (IPD), 3-methoxy-3-methylbutan-1-ol (MMB) or its acetate (MMB-Ac), butyro-1.4-lacton, 1.3-dioxacyclopentan, 4-methyl-1.3-dioxacyclopentan or a mixture of these.
