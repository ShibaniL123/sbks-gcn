Example 11. Synthesis of Ammonium Functionalized TEMPO (4-NMe-TEMPO and 4-NNPr-TEMPO) as Catholyte Materials and their Application in Anion Exchange AORFBs
Synthesis of 4-Dimethylamino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine(1)
4-Amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (15.6 g, 0.1 mol) and formaldehyde aqueous solution (17.0 g, 0.21 mol) was added into ice cooled formic acid (23.0 g, 0.5 mol) dropwise. Then solution was stirred overnight. After cooling down the solution, sodium hydroxide was added until oil layer generated. The orange oil layer was extracted by 30 mL diethyl ether and washed by NaCl saturate solution. The solution was dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removing the solvent under vacuum, the product was obtained as colorless oil (15.8 g, 85.9%).
