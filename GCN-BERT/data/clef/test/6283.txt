The primary alkanolamines used were monoethanolamine (MEA), 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), monoisopropanolamine (MIPA), and 2-(2-aminoethoxy)-ethanol (AEE). Secondary alkanolamine used was 2-butylaminoethanol (BAE). Tertiary alkanolamines were triethanolamine (TEA) and bis(hydroxyethyl)methylamine (BHEMA). Test Formulation The formulation used for these tests was prepared in 2 stages. The following amounts were used to prepare 100 grams of the formulation. For stage one, the following was added: distilled water, 2.7 g; tertiary or secondary amine, 10.1 g; primary amine, 2.6 g; boric acid, 2.0 g; Corfree™ M1, 1.2 g; pelargonic acid, 0.2 g; caprylic acid, 0.2 g; citric acid, 0.1 g; and glycerin, 0.2g. Each of the above components was added individually and in order with heating (50°C) and mixing. Each ingredient was allowed to thoroughly dissolve before adding the next component. Heating of the mixture was discontinued after all ingredients were added. The following ingredients were added to the stage one mixture: distilled water, 65.7 g; primary amine, 1.0 g; Pluronic™ 25R (100% polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block copolymer), 10.0 g; caprylic acid, 2.0 g; sodium tolyltriazole - 50% solution, 1.0 g; and biocide, 0.3-0.6 g. The ingredients were added individually and in the above order at room temperature with mixing. Each ingredient was allowed to thoroughly dissolve before adding the next component. It is contemplated that this formulation would be suitable as a metalworking fluid if it were diluted with water by a factor of 20. Each formulation received an addition of one of the following stabilizers, at a 1:1 ratio to the biocide active ingredient to stabilizer. Stabilizers tested were potassium iodate, iodic acid, iodopropynylbutylcarbamate (IPBC) and mercaptobenzothiazole (MBZ). A sample without stabilizer served as a control. Biocide additions (by weight of active ingredient) to formulations were as follows: 2,000 ppm MIT, 1,000 ppm OIT, and 4,000ppm BIT. The biocides used in this study were Kordek™ LX 5000 (50% MIT), Kathon™ 893 MW (45% OIT), and Rocima™ BT 2S (19% BIT). Samples were aged at 50°C for 30 days to determine the percent biocide remaining over time. The 3-isothiazolone content was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) at time zero (initial, prior to aging) and after 30 days. The % remaining of the biocides are reported for each amine combination and in the presence or absence of 4 stabilizers. The initial pH of the various formulations was pH 10-11.

None of the stabilizers were effective (no increased stability of MIT) with any of the combinations using BAE as the secondary amine. Combinations with TEA or BHEMA as the tertiary amine provided greatly improved stability of the MIT (from 67 to 100% remaining) with one or more of the stabilizers. The AMP/BHEMA amine combination (#8) was most effective with no measurable loss of biocide with all stabilizers tested (100% remaining). Combinations #3 (MIPA/TEA) and #4 (AMP/TEA) also showed excellent stability with three of the four stabilizers. Overall, iodate and iodic acid demonstrated the best improvement in stability of MIT with 8 amine combinations showing greater than 60% of the biocide remaining. IPBC and MBZ were effective stabilizers with three and one amine combination, respectively.
