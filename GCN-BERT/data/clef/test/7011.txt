LIQUID-DISPENSING HAIR BRUSH TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to personal hygiene and grooming aids, and particularly to a liquid-dispensing hair brush for applying creams, oils, water, and/or other liquids to the hair and/or scalp of the user. BACKGROUND ART Brushes, combs, and the like for care and upkeep of the hair have been known for a considerable period of time. Generally, there have been no major changes in the configurations or functions of such devices since their earliest development. The principle remains simple, i.e., to untangle and arrange the hair in an attractive style. However, it is generally necessary to provide additional means to hold the hair in the style or coiffure arranged by the brush or comb. Hair is often rather unruly and can be quite difficult to retain in the initially combed or brushed style, depending upon the dryness of the person's hair, the ambient heat and humidity, wind, and perhaps other factors, as well. Accordingly, the use of some form of hair gel, tonic, or oil has been known for quite some time for use in retaining the hair in the desired style. Conventionally, such oils and the like are applied to the hair and then the hair is brushed or combed to the desired style, with the oil assisting in securing the individual strands of hair in place as desired. The oils, gels, and the like may also contribute to the flexibility of the individual hair strands, particularly in the case of dry hair in a hot and dry climate, with such oils and the like thus being a desirable part of the treatment of the hair during periodic grooming. However, the use of some form of hair oil or tonic with conventional brushing or combing typically requires a two-step process, wherein the oil or other agent is initially applied to the hair and the hair is then brushed or combed to the desired style. As a result, various devices have been developed in the past for the application of a hair grooming oil or the like with the brushing or combing of the hair. An example of such a device is found in Chinese Patent Publication No. 2852811 published on January 3, 2007 to Ting Wang. This reference describes a brush having an oil groove along one edge thereof. Also, Japanese Patent Publication No. 2008-272,395 published on November 13, 2008 to Reiko Misaku describes a comb formed from a short length of bamboo, and impregnated with oil. Thus, a liquid-dispensing hair brush addressing the aforementioned problems is desired. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION The liquid-dispensing hair brush includes various embodiments of a device that can apply at the same or approximately the same time a hair treatment liquid (oil, gel, tonic, etc.) to the hair and scalp as the hair is being brushed. A first embodiment of a liquid- dispensing brush includes an internal reservoir for a hair grooming liquid (oil, tonic, gel, etc.), with the liquid passing from the reservoir out through passages formed through the hollow teeth or bristles of the brush. A second embodiment of a liquid hair dispensing brush is similar to the first embodiment, but includes a pressurizing member to pressurize the internal reservoir to more effectively force the liquid from the reservoir and through the teeth or bristles of the brush. A third embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hair brush includes an internal plate with a plurality of stops extending therefrom, the stops corresponding to the internal openings or pores corresponding to each of the teeth or bristles. The plate may be adjusted by an external handle extending through the back of the brush, to open or close the internal pores or openings. A fourth embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hair brush includes a reservoir within the handle, with a pressurizing control disposed upon the handle or at the base of the brush where it meets the handle to pressurize the liquid contents of the reservoir. The handle may separate from the brush head to enable the hollow handle to be filled. Additional embodiments comprise various mechanical systems disposed within the handle of the brush, for selectively dispensing liquid from a reservoir contained within the handle. These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The liquid-dispensing hair brush includes various embodiments, with each of the embodiments providing for the application of a hair treatment liquid (oil, gel, tonic, etc.) into the hair and onto the scalp of the user simultaneously or at approximately the same time as the hair is brushed. Fig. 1 provides an environmental perspective view of a first embodiment of the liquid-dispensing hair brush, designated as hair brush 110. The hair brush 110 includes a hollow head portion 12 formed by a back 14 and a face 16, with an exemplary face being illustrated in Fig. 3 for a different embodiment of a liquid-dispensing brush. The hollow head 12 generally including the back 14 and the face 16 defines a reservoir 15 for a liquid 29, such as a hair treatment reservoir for a hair treatment liquid. The embodiment of the liquid- dispensing hair brush 110 of Fig. 1 includes a filler tube or neck 18 atop the back 14 to fill the internal reservoir 15 with the liquid 29, such as a hair treatment liquid, as desired. A cap 19, or other suitable closing member, is provided to selectively close or open the filler tube or neck 18 to respectively fill or contain the liquid 29 in the reservoir 15. The face 16 of the brush 110 includes a relatively large number of elongate, hollow brush elements 20 extending outwardly therefrom. The brush elements 20 can include relatively short, large diameter teeth 21, as shown in Fig. 1, or can alternatively include relatively long, thin, flexible bristles, such as provided in the embodiment of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 410 of Fig. 6, for example. In both cases the brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21 or bristles, are generally hollow, with their hollow cores 27 communicating with the hollow head 12 and the reservoir 15 by corresponding passages or pores 22 disposed through the face 16 of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 110, as shown in the embodiment of Fig. 3 of the drawings, for example. The hair treatment reservoir 15 can be pressurized in order to assist the liquid 29 in the reservoir 15 to flow from the reservoir 15 and outward through the brush elements 20, such as through openings or pores 23 in the ends 25 of the brush elements 20, such as from the ends 25 of the teeth 21. In Fig. 1, a pressurizing member, such as a pushbutton pneumatic control 24, is provided at a suitable location along the handle 26 extending from the head 12 of the embodiment of the liquid-dispensing brush 110. The pneumatic control 24 can be any of various known types, e.g., pushing the control member 24 operates a small one-way pneumatic valve to force air into the internal reservoir 15 of the head 12 of the liquid- dispensing brush 110 to force or assist the liquid 29 in the reservoir 15 to flow out from the pores 23 at the ends 25 of the brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21. Referring to Fig. 2, another embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hair brush is illustrated, designated as a liquid-dispensing hair brush 210. The liquid-dispensing hair brush 210 also includes a hollow head portion 12 formed by the back 14 and face 16, with the back 14 and the face 16 defining the hair treatment reservoir 15 for the containment of the liquid 29, such as a hair treatment liquid, therein. A plurality of elongate, hollow brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21, extend from the face 16 of the brush head 12 with their hollow cores 27 communicating with the reservoir 15 of the head by the corresponding passages or pores 22 (shown in Fig. 3) through the face 16 of the brush head 12, similar to the embodiment of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 110 of Fig. 1. However, rather than placing the filler neck 18 and cap 19 at some point on the back 14 of the brush 210, the filler neck 18 and the cap 19 are relocated to a point generally at the juncture of the head 12 and the base of the handle 26 extending from the head 12. The cap 19 is removed in Fig. 2, to allow the hair treatment reservoir 15 to be replenished with the liquid 29 from the container C. However, an area on the back 14, such as the area used for the filler neck 18 and cap 19 in the liquid-dispensing hair brush 110 of Fig. 1, serves as a pneumatic inlet port 28. A pneumatic bulb 30 or other suitable pressurizing member, communicates with the inlet port 28, and thus with the internal reservoir 15, either directly or by a flexible pneumatic line 32, for example, as shown in Fig. 2. Applying a pressure to the reservoir 15 by manipulation of the pneumatic bulb 30 acts to force or assist, and can assist in controlling, the liquid 29 in the reservoir 15 to flow out from the pores 23 at the ends 25 of the brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21, similar to the flow of liquid 29 from the liquid-dispensing hair brush 110 of Fig. 1. This pneumatic pressurizing system of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 210, such as including the pneumatic bulb 30, can be used in conjunction with a pressurizing member on the handle 26, such as the pneumatic control 24, or can avoid including a separate pneumatic button-type pump 24 on the handle 26, such as provided in the liquid-dispensing hair brush 110 of Fig. 1, for example. Figs. 3 through 5 of the drawings provide illustrations of yet another embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hair brush, designated as liquid-dispensing hair brush 310. The hair brush 310 includes a head 312 formed of a back 314 and a face 316, with the back 314 and the face 316 each having a handle portion, respectively 26a and 26b, extending therefrom. Disassembly of the handle portions 26a and 26b can assist in cleaning of the liquid- dispensing hairbrush 310. Also, embodiments of the liquid-dispensing hair brush, such as the liquid-dispensing hair brushes 110 and 210, can also be formed of discrete handle portions, similar to the handle portions 26a and 26b, which can be similarly assembled and disassembled, for example. The back 314, the face 316, and the two handle portions 26a and 26b are assembled to one another in forming the liquid-dispensing hair brush 310, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Also, the handle portions 26a and 26b can also include a hollow cavity, when assembled, to provide or define a second reservoir 15a, as a second hair treatment reservoir, for holding the liquid 29, such as a hair treatment liquid. The reservoir 15a can be separate from, integral with, or communicate with the reservoir 15 that is formed or defined by the back 314 and the face 316 for the containment of the liquid 29, such as a hair treatment liquid. Also, the embodiments of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 110 and 210 can similarly include the reservoir 15 a, for example. A filler neck 18 and cap 19 are provided on the back 314 of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 310 to receive the liquid 29, such as a hair treatment liquid, from a container CI, generally in the same location as in the embodiment of the liquid-dispensing brush 110 of Fig. 1. The face 316 of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 310 includes brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21, extending therefrom as in other embodiments, with the passages or pores 22 extending through the face 316 being plainly visible in the exploded view of Fig. 3. The passages or pores 22 communicate with the reservoir 15 in the head 312 and also communicate with the hollow cores 27 of the brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21. Applying a pressure or a force to the reservoir 15 acts to force or assist a liquid 29 in the reservoir 15 and in the reservoir 15a to flow out from the pores 23 at the ends 25 of the brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21, similar to the flow of the liquid 29 from the liquid- dispensing hair brushes 110 and 210 of Figs. 1 and 2. The embodiment of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 310 of Figs. 3 through 5 differs from other of the illustrated embodiments in that it includes a central plate 34 captured or moveably positioned within the head 312 between the back 314 and face 316, such as shown in Fig. 3. A series of stops 36 extend from the plate 34 toward an internal surface 316a of the face 316, with each of the stops 36 being aligned with or in a corresponding relation to at least one of the passages or pores 22 through the face 316 of the liquid- dispensing hair brush 310. A flow adjustment member, such as a flow adjustment handle 38, extends through a handle passage 40 formed through the back 314, allowing the user of the liquid- dispensing hair brush 310 to manipulate or position the central plate 34 within the brush head 312 to control a flow of the liquid 29 from the reservoirs 15 and 15 a, as desired. Lifting, moving or positioning the flow adjustment handle 38 in a direction away from the brush head 312 removes, moves or adjusts a position of the stops 36 in relation to the passages or pores 22 in a direction away from their corresponding passages or pores 22 through the face 316, to allow and control the liquid 29, such as a hair treatment liquid, to flow from the interior of the head 312 out through the passages or pores 22 and from the pores 23 at the ends 25 of the corresponding brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21, and can assist in creating a pressure or a force to assist the flow of the fluid 29 from the interior of the head 312, to treat the hair and/or scalp of the user. Pushing the handle 38 toward the brush head 312 moves, positions or adjusts a position of the stops 36 to engage or position the stops 36 in relation to or with their corresponding pores or passages 22, to control, limit or shut off flow of the liquid 29 from the internal reservoir 15 and the reservoir 15a through the passages 27 of the brush elements 20, such as to the teeth 21. Also, the embodiment of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 310 can include a pneumatic pressure control, such as the pneumatic control 24, located on at least one of the handle portions 26a and 26b of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 310, such as the pneumatic control 24 described with respect to Fig. 1, or can include a pneumatic control 30 located on the back 314 of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 310 and the pneumatic line 32, such as the pneumatic bulb 30 and pneumatic line 32 described with respect to Fig. 2. The addition of the pneumatic control 24 or the pneumatic bulb 30 to the liquid-dispensing hair brush 310 can assist in controlling a flow of the liquid 29 and can assist the liquid 29 in the reservoirs 15 and 15a to flow out from the pores 23 at the ends 25 of the brush elements 20, such as the teeth 21, similar to the flow of liquid 29 from the liquid-dispensing hair brushes 110 of Fig. 1 and 210 of Fig. 2, for example. Fig. 6 provides an illustration of still another embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hair brush, designated as liquid-dispensing hair brush 410. The liquid-dispensing hair brush 410 includes a head 412 having a configuration similar to the brush head 12 of the liquid- dispensing hair brush 110 of Fig. 1, i.e., having a back 414 and a face 416. However, rather than having a plurality of rigid teeth 21 as in Fig. 1 extending from the face of the liquid- dispensing hair brush 410, the liquid-dispensing hair brush 410 includes a relatively large number of generally hollow flexible bristles 420 as the brush elements extending from the face 416 thereof. Each of the bristles 420 extends from a corresponding passage or pore 417 through the face 416. The passages or pores 417 of the brush face 416 are similar to the passages or pores 22 shown through the brush face 316 of the embodiment of the liquid- dispensing hair brush embodiment 310 of Fig. 3, although the passages or pores 417 are generally smaller in diameter, or are generally smaller in a cross dimension, and also are typically greater in number than the passages or pores 22, for example. The bristles 420 include hollow cores or passages 427 communicating with the head 412 by the corresponding passages or pores 417 and also include a passage or pore 423 at an end 425 of each of the bristles 420, for example, to provide for a flow of the liquid 29 from the head 412 through the passages or pores 417 and the passages 427 and out through the passages or pores 423 at the ends 425 of the bristles 420. The liquid-dispensing hair brush 410 of Fig. 6 further includes a reservoir 428, as a hair treatment reservoir, for the liquid 29, such as a hair treatment liquid, disposed within the hollow handle 426, rather than within the head 412 of the brush. However, the liquid- dispensing hair brush 410 can also include a reservoir or cavity for the liquid 29 in the head 412, similar to the reservoir 15 of the liquid-dispensing hair brushes 110, 210 and 310, for example, which can communicate with the reservoir 428, for example. A filler passage 418 is provided at the base of the handle 426, where it joins the head 412 of the brush 410 to receive the liquid 29 from a dispenser D. The hollow internal volume of the handle 426, such as can include the reservoir 428, can communicate with the hollow internal volume of the head 412, or the head 412 may contain a series of small passages extending from the hollow handle 426 to the various passages or pores 417 through the face 416 to deliver the liquid 29, such as a hair treatment liquid, to the hollow bristles 420. The reservoir 428 in the hollow handle 426, and the liquid 29 therein, can be pressurized by a pressurizing control, such as a pneumatic pressure control, such as a pushbutton pump 24 located at a suitable point on the handle 426, essentially as that provided by the pushbutton pneumatic control 24 of the embodiment of the liquid-dispensing hair brush 110 of Fig. 1, as described. The pneumatic control 24 pressurizes the reservoir 428 to force or assist, and can assist in controlling the flow of, the liquid 29 in the reservoir 428 to flow to the head 412 through the pores 417 and out from the passages or pores 423 at the ends 425 of the bristles 420. Figs. 7 and 8 provide illustrations of yet another embodiment of the liquid- dispensing hair brush, designated as liquid-dispensing hair brush 510. The brush 510 of Figs. 7 and 8 includes a hollow brush head 512 having a large number of hollow bristles 520 having hollow cores communicating with the hollow brush head 512 in the manner of the brush embodiment 410 of Fig. 6. The bristles 520 may have distal pores at their ends, and/or lateral pores to permit fluid outflow at points along the lengths of the bristles, if desired. A hollow handle 526 is releasably attached to the base of the brush head 512, e.g., by the cooperatively threaded neck 518 of the handle 526. The hollow interior of the handle 526 is adapted to contain a supply of fluid, e.g., hair oil, gel, etc. The hollow handle interior communicates with the hollow brush head 512, and thus with the hollow bristles 520, to allow fluid to flow from the handle 526 outward through the bristles 520. A pneumatic pushbutton pump 524 is disposed at some convenient location on the brush 510, e.g., at the base of the brush head 512 at its juncture with the handle 526, to pressurize the interior volumes of the handle 526 and brush head 512 and thereby expel fluid contained therein from the bristles 520. An elongate pickup tube 528 extends from the brush head 512 through the hollow handle 526 to the interior of the base thereof to draw fluid from the handle and into the brush head 512. Fig. 9 provides an illustration of yet another embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hairbrush, designated as liquid-dispensing hairbrush 610. Certain aspects of the brush 610 of Fig. 9 are similar to those of the brushes 410 and 510 of Figs. 6 through 8, although the various corresponding components have been designated using a different series of reference numerals. The liquid-dispensing hairbrush 610 includes a hollow brush head 612 having a large number of flexible brush elements or bristles 614 extending therefrom, similar to the brush head 512 and brush elements or bristles 520 of the liquid-dispensing hairbrush 510 of Figs. 7 and 8. The brush elements or bristles 614 are hollow tubular elements to allow liquid to flow therethrough from the hollow brush head 512, as in the liquid-dispensing hairbrushes 410 of Fig. 6 and 510 of Figs. 7 and 8. A hollow shank 616 extends from the head 612, and a hollow handle 620 extends from the shank 616 and communicates with the head 612 by means of the shank 616. The hollow handle 620 includes an internal liquid storage cavity 622 therein. A plunger 624 of elastomer or other suitable material is slidingly disposed within the handle storage cavity 622, the edges of the plunger 624 making a good seal with the internal walls of the hollow handle 620. A spring 626 is seated in the distal end 628 of the hollow handle 620 and compressively urges the plunger 624 through the storage cavity 622 toward the head 614 of the liquid-dispensing hairbrush 610. The plunger 624 may be retained near the distal end 628 of the handle 620 by latches 630 extending inwardly from the inner walls of the hollow handle 620 near the distal end 628 thereof. The latches 630 may be selectively released by pressure on the external tabs 632 that extend from the handle 620 near the distal end 628 thereof, thereby allowing the spring 626 to push the plunger 624 through the internal cavity 622 of the handle 620 to expel any fluid therein from the pores of the bristles or brush elements 614. A retraction lever 634 extends from the edge of the plunger 624, the extension or connection between the plunger 624 and lever 634 traveling in a slot 636 formed along the side of the handle 620. The liquid-dispensing hairbrush 610 is used by first retracting the spring 626 and plunger 624 by means of the retraction lever 634 and capturing the plunger 624 with the internal latches 630 to maximize the internal volume 622 of the handle 620 between the plunger 624 and the shank portion 616. A filler port and cap 638 for filling the handle 620 is provided at the juncture of the handle 620 and shank 616. The cap 638 is removed and the internal volume 622 of the handle 620 is filled with shaving cream, foam, gel, or other liquid. The cap 638 is then replaced, and the plunger 624 is released by manipulating the external release tabs 632 adjacent the distal end 628 of the handle 620 to pressurize the contents of the handle 620 by means of the spring 626 and plunger 624. A dispensing control valve 640 of conventional configuration is provided at the juncture of the handle 620 and shank 616. Operation of the valve 640 opens the passage from the internal volume 622 of the handle 620 through the shank 616 to the dispensing pores of the brush head 614, thereby dispensing the liquid from the pores as the spring 626 and plunger 624 urge the liquid within the internal volume 622 of the handle 620 toward the brush head 612. Fig. 10 provides an illustration of a further embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hairbrush, comprising a hairbrush 710 having a hollow handle for the containment of water, hair tonic or gel, and/or other liquid. The hairbrush 710 includes a porous head 712 having hollow bristles 714 extending therefrom and a hollow handle portion 720 connected to the head 712 by a shank 716. The liquid-dispensing hairbrush 710 includes a hollow handle portion 720 extending from the head 712, as noted above. The handle 720 includes an internal liquid storage cavity 722 therein. A plunger 724 of elastomer or other suitable material is slidingly disposed within the handle storage cavity 722, the edges of the plunger 724 making a good seal with the internal walls of the hollow handle 720. A spring 726 is seated in the distal end 728 of the hollow handle 720 and compressively urges the plunger 724 through the storage cavity 722 toward the head 712 of the hairbrush 710. The dispensing mechanism of the hairbrush 710 differs from that of the hairbrush 610 in that the lever or slide 734 along the side of the handle 720 is not directly connected to the plunger 724 within the handle. The slide or lever 734 rides or slides in a slot 736 through the side of the handle 720 and is connected to a cable, cord, or the like 742 that extends toward the distal end 728 of the handle to pass around a pair of rollers or pulleys 744 disposed within the distal end 728 of the handle, thence continuing up to attach to the bottom of the plunger 724, i.e., to the same side of the plunger that bears against the spring 726. The at-rest positions of the plunger 724 and slide or lever 734 are shown in broken lines in Fig. 10, and the compressive spring 726 is also shown in broken lines in its fully extended state. The hairbrush 710 is used by first retracting the spring 726 and plunger 724 by sliding the slide or lever 734 from its rest position near the distal end 728 of the handle 720 to its position as shown in solid lines near the shank 716 of the hairbrush 710. This draws the cable or cord 742 upward along the slot 736, thereby drawing the cable 742 around the rollers or pulleys 744 to draw the plunger 724 to a position shown in solid lines toward the distal end 728 of the handle 720, thereby compressing the spring 726, as shown in solid lines in Fig. 10. The internal volume 722 of the handle 720 may then be filled with shaving cream, foam, gel, or other liquid through the cap 738. The cap 738 is then replaced, and the plunger 724 is released by releasing the slide or lever 734 from its position shown in broken lines to allow the spring to push the plunger 724 toward the hairbrush head 712, thereby forcing the liquid contained within the handle 720 up through the shank 716 and hairbrush head 712 and out through the pores of the hairbrush bristles 714 to moisten the hair of the user of the liquid- dispensing hairbrush 710. Fig. 11 provides an illustration of a further embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hairbrush, comprising a hairbrush 810 having a hollow handle for the containment of water, hair cream, and/or other liquid. The hairbrush 810 includes a porous head 812 having a brush or hollow bristles 814 extending therefrom and a hollow handle portion 820 connected to the head 812 by a shank 816. The hairbrush 810 includes a hollow handle portion 820 extending from the shank 816. The handle 820 includes an internal liquid storage cavity 822 therein. A plunger 824 of elastomer or other suitable material is slidingly disposed within the handle storage cavity 822, the edges of the plunger 824 making a good seal with the internal walls of the hollow handle 820. One or more elastic bands or cords 826 extend from the plunger 824 to the upper end 830 of the hollow cavity or chamber 822 and draw the plunger 824 through the storage cavity 822 toward the head 812 of the hairbrush 810. The dispensing mechanism of the hairbrush 810 differs from that of the brush 710. Rather than using a compressive spring, the brush 810 uses one or more elastomer bands or cords in tension. The slide or lever 834 rides or slides in a slot 836 through the side of the handle 820 and is connected to a cable, cord, or the like 842 that extends toward the distal end 828 of the handle to pass around a pair of rollers or pulleys 844 disposed within the distal end 828 of the handle, thence continuing up to attach to the bottom of the plunger 824, i.e., to the opposite side of the plunger from that connected to the elastomer cord(s) 826. The hairbrush 810 is used by first extending the elastomer cord(s) 826 and drawing the plunger 824 toward the distal end 828 of the handle 820 by sliding the slide or lever 834 from its rest position near the distal end 828 of the handle 820 to a position nearer the head 812 of the brush 810. (The slide or lever 834 and plunger 824 are illustrated at an intermediate position in Fig. 11.) This draws the cable or cord 842 upward along the slot 836, thereby drawing the cable 842 around the rollers or pulleys 844 to draw the plunger 824 toward the distal end 828 of the handle 820, thereby extending the elastomer cord(s) 826. The internal volume 822 of the handle 820 may then be filled with shaving cream, foam, gel, or other liquid through the cap 838. The cap 838 is then replaced, and the plunger 824 is released by releasing the slide or lever 834 from its position shown in broken lines to allow the elastomer cord(s) 826 to draw the plunger 824 toward the hairbrush head 812, thereby forcing the liquid contained within the handle 820 up through the upper end 830 of the hollow handle cavity 822 and hairbrush head 812 and out through the pores of the hollow bristles or brush elements 814 to moisten the hair of the user of the hairbrush 810. Fig. 12 provides an illustration of a further embodiment of a liquid-dispensing hairbrush, comprising a hairbrush 910 having a hollow handle for the containment of water, hair cream, and/or other liquid. The hairbrush 910 includes a porous head having a brush or hollow bristles 914 extending therefrom and a hollow handle portion 920 connected to the head 912 by a shank 916. The liquid-dispensing hairbrush 910 includes a hollow handle portion 920 attached to the head 912 via the intermediate connecting shank 916. The handle 920 includes an internal liquid storage cavity 922 therein. Rather than using a plunger and other mechanism to urge or force liquid within the handle up toward the brush head, the hairbrush 910 uses a small manually operated pneumatic pump 924 of conventional mechanism to pressurize the interior volume 922 of the handle 920. The pump 924 may be operated by using the thumb or finger to operate a lever 934. Prior to pressurizing the internal volume 922 of the handle 920, the internal volume 922 of the handle 920 may be filled with hair cream, foam, gel, or other liquid through the cap (similar to e.g., to the cap 638 of the hairbrush embodiment 610 of Fig. 9). The cap is then replaced, and the pump 924 is actuated by means of the lever 934, thereby pressurizing the interior volume 922 of the handle 920 and forcing the liquid contained within the handle 920 up to the hairbrush head 912 and out through the hollow porous bristles 914 of the hairbrush head 912 to moisten the hair of the user of the hairbrush 910. Control of the amount of liquid dispensed is provided by means of a dispensing control valve 940 of conventional configuration disposed at the pump 924, at the juncture of the handle 920 and shank 916. The control valve 940 may be of similar configuration to that of the valve 640 of the hairbrush 610 of Fig. 9. The various embodiments of the liquid-dispensing hair brush can be used to apply a number of various liquids to the hair and/or scalp of the user, e.g., water, hair oil, hair tonic, and/or even some thicker hair gels, depending upon the diameters of the pores or passages in the face of the brush and brush elements, for example. Embodiments of the liquid-dispensing hair brush can be economically manufactured of a plastic material or other economical material. Moreover, the embodiments of a liquid-dispensing hair brush can be manufactured so as to allow the handle to be removed from the head to facilitate cleaning of the various components.
