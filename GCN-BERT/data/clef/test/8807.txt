A foam pad, used by males, placed on floor in front of the toilet, the male kneels on The Pee Pad in front of/facing toilet and urinates into toilet bowl for less urine splash on toilet and floor and less noise than urinating standing up, because he is urinating from a lower level into the toilet bowl. A 1 foot by 2 foot by 4 inch (can also make in 1″ to 10″ heights) cushion foam (made from polyethylene minicell) with a small portion cut off on one of the 2 foot sides (to allow space to go around the base of the toilet) and a portion on both of the one foot sides to provide a rounded appearance. The sides are smooth as are the top and bottom. One of the flat 1′×2′ sides (the part the male kneels on) is silkscreened with the company name/trademark, uses for the pad, required legal information, etc. The male put this in front of the toilet on the floor and kneels on it to urinate. This is made at a factory where the polyethylene minicell foam is molded and cut into the size described above and detailed on the Diagram. FIG. 1 is a top view of pee pad. The left and right sides are one foot long and top and the bottom sides are two feet, with a small curve cut out. FIG. 2 is a side view of the pee pd from all angles, which shows the height at four inches. BACKGROUND The field of endeavor is creating a bathroom product/invention. This product is a solution to the age old problem of males standing in front of a commode, urinating, and missing the toilet bowl and getting urine on the toilet and floor. Plus urinating standing up makes too much noise. The Pee Pad invention/product solves these problems. How to use: Place the soft and comfortable Pee Pad on the floor in front of the toilet, the male then kneels on the pad, facing the toilet, unzips and urinates into the toilet bowl from a much closer range than if he were standing up. No more having to clean up urine splashed on the toilet and floor. The product also reduces the noise made while males urinate into the toilet bowl. It is also a more comfortable way for males to urinate and empties bladder better than sitting. SUMMARY OF INVENTION This unique pad, as described above, is a pad that males will kneel on when urinating in a bathroom, reducing splash and noise. It can also be used for little boys to stand on when going to the bathroom, under a small child's feet when sitting on a toilet, under a child's feet when standing to brush teeth at sink, as a lap table that fits across the bath tub, for parents to kneel on when giving kids a bath and as a knee pad for cleaning. 1. I came up with this idea because of complaining I heard about males urinating on the floor and toilet and also making a lot of noise. It is my own idea. 2. This polyethylene pad is for males to use while urinating by placing the pad in front of the toilet and the male kneeling on the pad so he urinates from a closer distance thereby creating less urine splash on the toilet and surrounding area and making less noise. 3. This new invention will make a lot of women happy. 4. The bathroom will be clean and noise free.
