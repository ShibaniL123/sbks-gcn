Example 172A
Ethyl 5-(difluoromethyl)-3-ethyl-2,4-dioxo-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate
1.35 g (4.15 mmol) of caesium carbonate were added to a solution of 880 mg (2.76 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 166A in 12 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 20 min. Then 929 mg (4.15 mmol) of 3,3,3-trifluoro-1-iodopropane were added, and the mixture was heated to 80Â° C. for 2 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was diluted with about 100 ml of ethyl acetate and, in succession, washed twice with in each case about 100 ml of water and once with about 100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 9). The product fractions were combined, concentrated and dried under high vacuum. 750 mg (63% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
