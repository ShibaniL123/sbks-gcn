Stearic acid was then coupled to dibenzyl malate using previously developed methods. In short, Dibenzyl malate (2.00 g, 6.37 mmol), stearic acid (1.99 g, 7.00 mmol), EDCI (1.84 g, 9.55 mmol), and DMAP (856 mg, 7.00 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL anhydrous DCM under argon. Following Dibenzyl malate consumption, as indicated by TLC (4:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate), the reaction was stopped and washed 3Ã—100 mL 10% KHSO4. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, isolated via vacuum filtration, and concentrated in vacuo. Crude DBM18 was then purified via silica gel column chromatography using 4:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate eluent to acquire pure product. Yield: 2.68 g, 72% (white powder).
