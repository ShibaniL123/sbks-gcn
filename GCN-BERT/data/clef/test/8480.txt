Step 1: Synthesis of 1-(3-chloro-2-fluorophenyl)-2-naphthol
Into a 200 mL three-neck flask were put 3.4 g (19 mmol) of 3-chloro-2-fluorophenylboronic acid, 4.0 g (18 mmol) of 1-bromo-2-naphthol, 0.13 g (0.36 mmol) of di(1-adamantyl)-n-butylphosphine, and 7.6 g (72 mmol) of sodium carbonate, and the atmosphere in the flask was replaced with nitrogen. To the mixture were added 90 mL of toluene and 36 mL of water, and the resulting mixture was degassed by being stirred while the pressure was reduced. After the degasification, 40 mg (0.18 mmol) of palladium(II) acetate was added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred at approximately 80Â° C. for 15 hours. After the stirring, the aqueous layer of this mixture was subjected to extraction with toluene, and the solution of the obtained extract and the organic layer were combined and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. The obtained organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate. This mixture was gravity-filtered, and the obtained filtrate was concentrated to give a brown oily substance. This oily substance was purified by silica gel column chromatography (using a developing solvent of toluene) to give 4.5 g of a target brown oily substance in a yield of 91%. The synthesis scheme of Step 1 is shown in (a-1) below.
