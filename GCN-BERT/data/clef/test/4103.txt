Synthesis of compound 28-b
Compound 28-c (1.03g, 3.25mmol) was added to POCl3 (10mL). The mixture was stirred at 100°C for 12hrs, cooled to room temperature, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Saturated NaHCO3 aq. solution was added to the residue to adjust pH=7, the mixture was extracted with EA (50mL×2). The organic phase was in turn washed with water (30mL) and saturated NaHCO3 aq. solution (30mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give compound 28-b (0.85g, yield 80%). The product was used directly for the next step without further purification.
