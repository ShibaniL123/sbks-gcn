TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy and a method for manufacturing the same. BACKGROUND ART Conventionally, an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy has been known as an alloy that shows superior properties at high temperatures (see Patent Documents 1 to 3, for example). This alloy has a dual multi-phase microstructure composed of a primary precipitate Ni3Al (L12) phase and an Al (fcc) phase existing in channels (upper microstructure); and a lower microstructure including Ni3Al (L12) and Ni3V (D022) formed through a eutectoid transformation from the Al (fcc) at a low temperature. The alloy therefore has excellent mechanical properties at high temperatures. RELATED ART DOCUMENTS Patent Documents Patent Document 1: Pamphlet of WO 2006/101212 Patent Document 2: Pamphlet of WO 2007/086185 Patent Document 3: Pamphlet of WO 2008/041592 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention The Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy has comparable or superior properties to existing Ni-base alloys. Still, it has been desired to develop an Ni-base intermetallic compound alloy having more enhanced tensile strength and ductility characteristics in a wide temperature range from room temperature to high temperature. For example, it has been desired to develop an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy which is less likely to undergo intergranular fracture in order to sufficiently draw out the mechanical properties of the dual multi-phase microstructure of the alloy. In view of the above-described circumstances, the present invention has been achieved to provide a dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy having enhanced tensile strength and ductility characteristics in a wide temperature range from room temperature to high temperature. Means for Solving the Problems The present invention provides an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy which has a dual multi-phase microstructure comprising a primary precipitate L12 phase and an (L12+D022) eutectoid microstructure, and which comprises: more than 5 atomic % and up to 13 atomic % of Al; at least 9.5 atomic % and less than 17.5 atomic % of V; between 0 atomic % and 5.0 atomic % inclusive of Nb; more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of Ti; more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of C; and a remainder comprising Ni. Effects of the Invention Focusing on strength enhancement achievable by solid solution strengthening of C and intergranular fracture inhibition achievable by intergranular segregation of C, the inventors of the present invention have originated an idea by which C is introduced into an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy, and made intensive studies. As a result, the inventors of the present invention have found that the inclusion of Ti and C in an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy containing Ni, Al and V leads to enhancement of the tensile strength and ductility characteristics to reach completion of the present invention. The present invention provides an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy having enhanced tensile strength and ductility characteristics in a wide temperature range from room temperature to high temperature.

MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION An Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy according to the present invention comprises more than 5 atomic % and up to 13 atomic % of Al, at least 9.5 atomic % and less than 17.5 atomic % of V, between 0 atomic % and 12.5 atomic % inclusive of Nb, more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of Ti, more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of C, and the remainder comprising Ni, and has a dual multi-phase microstructure comprising a primary precipitate L12 phase and an (L12+D022) eutectoid microstructure. Here, the remainder comprising Ni may include inevitable impurities. Hereinafter, summing the atomic percentages of Al, V, Nb, Ti, C and Ni in the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention becomes 100 atomic % as a composition, unless otherwise stated. In addition, the primary precipitate L12 phase is an L12 phase dispersed in an A1 phase as shown in FIG. 3, for example, and the (L12+D022) eutectoid microstructure is an eutectoid microstructure including L12 and D022 formed through decomposition of the A1 phase as shown in FIG. 3, for example. Preferably, the Ti content is more than 0 atomic % and up to 4.6 atomic %, and the C content is more than 0 atomic % and up to 4.6 atomic %. More preferably, the Ti content is between 0.2 atomic % and 2.4 atomic % inclusive, and the C content is between 0.2 atomic % and 2.4 atomic % inclusive. The contents in these ranges allow further enhancement of the tensile strength and the ductility characteristics. Since the enhancement of the tensile strength and the ductility characteristics is owing to the development of a solid solution strengthening mechanism by C and to the intergranular fracture inhibition by the intergranular segregation of C, the Ti content and the C content may be the same or different. For example, the C content may be less than the Ti content. Specifically, the Ti content may be 3.0 atomic %, and the C content may be between 0.1 atomic % and 4.0 atomic % inclusive. Furthermore, since the tensile strength and the ductility characteristics can be enhanced even when the Ti content and the C content are small, the Ti content and the C content may be about the same as the B content described later. In addition, in an embodiment, the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention may be formed by adding TiC to Al, V, Nb and Ni as the alloy materials. That is, the alloy may be formed by adding TiC to the alloy materials including Ni as a main component, more than 5 atomic % and up to 13 atomic % of Al, at least 9.5 atomic % and less than 17.5 atomic % of V, and between 0 atomic % and 5.0 atomic % inclusive of Nb. (In other words, the alloy may be the one obtained by adding TiC to these alloy materials and melting and casting the materials.) According to this embodiment, in which C is introduced into the materials of the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy as a carbide, the formation of the dual multi-phase microstructure is not interfered with, when the TiC added exists in the dual multi-phase microstructure matrix as second phase particles or when the TiC decomposes into Ti and C to be included in the dual multi-phase microstructure matrix as a solid solution. Thereby, the tensile strength and the ductility characteristics can be enhanced. The amount of TiC to be added may be more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic %. The alloy containing TiC is formed by producing an ingot from a molten metal prepared by adding TiC to the alloy materials. Preferably, the amount of TiC to be added is more than 0 atomic % and up to 4.6 atomic %, and more preferably, the amount is between 0.2 atomic % and 2.4 atomic % inclusive. The alloy containing TiC in such a range of amount can have more enhanced tensile strength and ductility characteristics. The amount of TiC to be added is determined so that the sum of Ni, Al, V and Nb as the alloy materials and TiC added thereto becomes 100 atomic %. In the above-mentioned configuration of the present invention, Ti and C may be contained in the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy as TiC. That is, the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy may contain Ti and C obtained through decomposition of TiC added, or the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy may contain TiC as well as Ti and C obtained through decomposition of TiC added. In an embodiment, the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention may have a microstructure different from the dual multi-phase microstructure, and the microstructure may contain TiC. When formed by adding TiC to Al, V, Nb and Ni as the alloy materials, the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy may have a dual multi-phase microstructure containing Ti and C obtained through decomposition of TiC added or may have a microstructure containing TiC in addition to the dual multi-phase microstructure. When large amounts of Ti and C are contained, for example, a microstructure different from the dual multi-phase microstructure is formed, and second phase particles (carbide particles) containing V, Nb, Ti and C as main components are formed. In an embodiment, the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention may be an alloy composed of Al, V, Nb, Ti and C as the alloy materials (that is, an alloy obtained by melting and casting these materials) as well as the alloy formed by adding TiC. In this case, the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy may be in the form including a microstructure comprising (V,Ti)C composed of V, Ti and C or in the form including the dual multi-phase microstructure and the microstructure comprising (V,Ti)C, for example. Here, the microstructure comprising (V,Ti)C is, for example, one containing Ni and Al as well as V, Ti and C as main components. In an embodiment, the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention may further contain B in addition to the above-mentioned components. That is, the B content may be 0 ppm by weight, or the B content may be more than 0 ppm by weight and up to 1000 ppm by weight. When both B and C are contained, B and C undergo intergranular segregation, which inhibits intergranular fracture, and therefore it is preferable that such a small amount of B is contained (for example, the B content is preferably more than 0 ppm by weight). The B content is preferably between 50 ppm by weight and 1000 ppm by weight inclusive, and more preferably between 100 ppm by weight and 800 ppm by weight inclusive. The B content is a value defined relative to the total weight of the composition of 100 atomic % including Al, V, Nb, C and Ni. In the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention, preferably, the Al content is between 6 atomic % and 10 atomic % inclusive, the V content is at least 12.0 atomic % and less than 16.5 atomic %, and the Nb content is between 1 atomic % and 4.5 atomic % inclusive. The Al content, the V content and the Nb content in these ranges facilitate formation of the dual multi-phase microstructure. A first method for manufacturing an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention comprises the steps of: forming a microstructure in which a primary precipitate L12 phase and an A1 phase coexist by slow cooling and casting a molten metal containing more than 5 atomic % and up to 13 atomic % of Al, at least 9.5 atomic % and less than 17.5 atomic % of V, between 0 atomic % and 5.0 atomic % inclusive of Nb, more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of Ti, more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of C, and the remainder comprising Ni; and decomposing the A1 phase into an L12 phase and a D022 phase by cooling the microstructure in which the primary precipitate L12 phase and the A1 phase coexist. A second method for manufacturing an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention comprises the steps of: preparing an ingot from a molten metal containing more than 5 atomic % and up to 13 atomic % of Al, at least 9.5 atomic % and less than 17.5 atomic % of V, between 0 atomic % and 5.0 atomic % inclusive of Nb, more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of Ti, more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of C, and the remainder comprising Ni; giving a first heat treatment to the ingot at a temperature at which a primary precipitate L12 phase and an A1 phase coexist; and decomposing the A1 phase into an L12 phase and a D022 phase by cooling after the first heat treatment. In the first and second manufacturing methods, the step of preparing an ingot from a molten metal includes the step of preparing an ingot from a molten metal containing alloy materials including Ni as a main component, more than 5 atomic % and up to 13 atomic % of Al, at least 9.5 atomic % and less than 17.5 atomic % of V, between 0 atomic % and 5.0 atomic % inclusive of Nb, more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of Ti, and more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of C. A third method for manufacturing an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention comprises the steps of: forming a microstructure in which a primary precipitate L12 phase and an A1 phase coexist by slow cooling a molten metal containing alloy materials including Ni as a main component, more than 5 atomic % and up to 13 atomic % of Al, at least 9.5 atomic % and less than 17.5 atomic % of V, between 0 atomic % and 5.0 atomic % inclusive of Nb, and more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of TiC; and decomposing the A1 phase into an L12 phase and a D022 phase by cooling the microstructure in which the primary precipitate L12 phase and the A1 phase coexist. A forth method for manufacturing an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention comprises the steps of: preparing an ingot from a molten metal containing alloy materials including Ni as a main component, more than 5 atomic % and up to 13 atomic % of Al, at least 9.5 atomic % and less than 17.5 atomic % of V, between 0 atomic % and 5.0 atomic % inclusive of Nb, and more than 0 atomic % and up to 12.5 atomic % of TiC; giving a first heat treatment to the ingot at a temperature at which a primary precipitate L12 phase and an A1 phase coexist; and decomposing the A1 phase into an L12 phase and a D022 phase by cooling after the first heat treatment. Here, the molten metal can be casted with a ceramic mold or with a metal mold wrapped with a heat insulating material, for example. In the step of preparing an ingot from a molten metal containing TiC, the molten metal is one prepared by adding TiC to Ni, Al, V and Nb as the alloy materials. Preferably, the TiC content (amount of TiC to be added) is more than 0 atomic % and up to 4.6 atomic %, and more preferably, the TiC content is between 0.2 atomic % and 2.4 atomic % inclusive. In the embodiments, these manufacturing methods may further comprise homogenization heat treatment or solution heat treatment in addition to the above-mentioned steps. The homogenization heat treatment or the solution heat treatment may be performed at a temperature from 1503 K to 1603 K, for example. Alternatively, the first heat treatment may serve as the homogenization heat treatment or the solution heat treatment. In the first and second manufacturing methods of the present invention, Al, V, Nb, Ti, C and Ni make up a composition of 100 atomic % in total. In the third and forth manufacturing methods of the present invention, on the other hand, the TiC content (amount of TiC to be added) is determined so that the sum of Ni, Al, V and Nb as the alloy materials and TiC added thereto becomes 100 atomic % (TiC compound content (amount of TiC compound to add)). In the step of preparing an ingot from a molten metal, the molten metal means one obtained by adding TiC in the above-mentioned content (amount) to the alloy materials so as to give 100 atomic %. According to these manufacturing methods, an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy having a dual multi-phase microstructure and a microstructure containing TiC, and an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy having a dual multi-phase microstructure and a microstructure comprising (V,Ti)C are formed. Thus, the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention may be, for example, an alloy having a dual multi-phase microstructure and a microstructure containing TiC, which is obtained according to the first and second manufacturing methods or an alloy having a dual multi-phase microstructure and a microstructure comprising (V,Ti)C, which is obtained according to the third and forth manufacturing methods. The embodiments shown herein may be combined with one another. In this description, “from A to B” means that numerical values A and B are included in the range. (The unit atomic % may be represented as at. %.) Hereinafter, each element in these embodiments will be described in detail. Specifically, the Al content is more than 5 at. % and up to 13 at. %, for example, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5 or 13 at. %. The Al content may range between any two of the numeral values exemplified as the specific contents. Specifically, the V content is at least 9.5 at. % and less than 17.5 at. %, for example, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5, 16, 16.5 or 17 at. %. The V content may range between any two of the numeral values exemplified as the specific contents. Specifically, the Nb content is between 0 at. % and 5.0 at. % inclusive, for example, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 or 5 at. %. The Nb content may range between any two of the numeral values exemplified as the specific contents. The Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention preferably contains Nb, but may not contain Nb. When not containing Nb, the alloy may contain more than 0.0 at. % and up to 5.0 at. % of Ti instead of Nb. Specifically, the Ti content is more than 0 at. % and up to 12.5 at. %, for example, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 4.6, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12 or 12.5 at. %. Specifically, the C content is more than 0 at. % and up to 12.5 at. %, for example, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 4.6, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12 or 12.5 at. %. The specific Ti content and the specific C content may be the same or different. Alternatively, the Ti content and the C content may be obtained by adding TiC to the material elements and melting the same. In this case, specifically, the TiC content is more than 0 at. % and up to 12.5 at. %, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 or 12.5 at. %. Preferably, the TiC content is more than 0 at. % and up to 4.6 at. %. For example, the TiC content is 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 or 4.6 at. %. The Ti content, the C content and the TiC content may range between any two of the numeral values exemplified as the specific contents. The amount of TiC to be added is determined so that the sum of Ni, Al, V and Nb as the alloy materials and TiC added thereto becomes 100 atomic % (the amount of TiC compound to be added). Specifically, the Ni content (content percentage) is preferably from 73 to 77 at. %, and more preferably from 74 to 76 at. %, because such ranges allow the ratio of the Ni content to the total of the (Al, V, Nb and Ti) contents to be approximately 3:1, discouraging development of any other phases than the L12 phase and the D022 phase that constitute the dual multi-phase microstructure. Specifically, the Ni content is 73, 73.5, 74, 74.5, 75, 75.5, 76, 76.5 or 77 at. %, for example. The Ni content may range between any two of the numeral values exemplified as the specific contents. Specifically, the B content is more than 0 ppm by weight and up to 1000 ppm by weight, for example 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 or 1000 ppm by weight. The B content may range between any two of the numeral values exemplified as the specific contents. The B content is a value defined relative to the total weight of the composition of 100 atomic % including Al, V, Nb, C and Ni. According to an embodiment of the present invention, specific compositions of the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy are obtained by adding the above-mentioned content of B to the compositions shown in Tables 1 to 3, for example.

The L12 phase is an Ni3Al intermetallic compound phase, and the D022 phase is an Ni3V intermetallic compound phase. In addition to the L12 phase and the D022 phase, depending on the composition, the dual multi-phase microstructure includes a D0a phase, which is an Ni3Nb intermetallic compound phase and a D024 phase, which is an Ni3Ti intermetallic compound phase. In addition, the dual multi-phase microstructure includes a carbide phase (TiC phase and (V,Ti)C phase) depending on the C content. Next, a method for manufacturing the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy will be described. First, raw metals are weighted so that each element accounts for the above-described proportion, and then melted by heating. The resulting molten metal is casted by cooling. Here, TiC, carbide, may be used to give the proportions of Ti and C. With TiC, the dual multi-phase microstructure can be formed more easily, and an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy enhanced in tensile strength and ductility characteristics can be produced more easily. Subsequently, the alloy materials casted are subjected to a first heat treatment at a temperature at which a primary precipitate L12 phase and an A1 phase coexist, and then cooled to decompose the A1 phase into an L12 phase and a D022 phase. Thereby, an Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy having a dual multi-phase microstructure including a primary precipitate L12 phase and a (L12+D022) eutectoid microstructure is formed. The L12 phase is an Ni3Al intermetallic compound phase, the A1 phase is an fcc solid solution phase, and the D022 phase is an Ni3V intermetallic compound phase. The intermetallic compound alloy having a dual multi-phase microstructure can be manufactured by the methods disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 3. For example, as disclosed in Patent Document 3, the intermetallic compound can be manufactured by the steps of: giving, at a temperature at which a primary precipitate L12 phase and an A1 phase coexist or at a temperature at which a primary precipitate L12 phase, an A1 phase and a D0a phase coexist, a first heat treatment to alloy materials (ingot or the like) obtained through melting and casting; and then cooling the resulting alloy materials to a temperature at which an L12 phase and a D022 phase and/or a D024 phase and/or a D0a phase coexist, or giving a second heat treatment at the temperature to cause the A1 phase to transform into an (L12+D022) eutectoid microstructure to form a dual multi-phase microstructure. In these Patent Documents, the formation of the upper multi-phase microstructure through the heat treatment at a temperature at which the primary precipitate L12 phase and the A1 phase coexist is performed as an independent process. Instead of the heat treatment, a molten metal in a process of producing an ingot of the intermetallic compound alloy may be slowly cooled down to achieve the formation of the upper multi-phase microstructure. During the slow cooling of the molten metal, the molten metal casted will be kept at the temperature at which the primary precipitate L12 phase and the A1 phase coexist for a relatively long time, and therefore the upper multi-phase microstructure including the primary precipitate L12 phase and the A1 phase is formed as in the case the heat treatment. The first heat treatment and the second heat treatment may be given according to the methods disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 3. For the Ni-base dual multi-phase intermetallic compound alloy of the present invention, however, the first heat treatment is given at 1503 to 1603 K, for example, and it serves as a solution heat treatment (homogenization heat treatment). Next, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to examples. In the following examples, cast materials were prepared and subjected to external observation, and then heat-treated to produce intermetallic compounds each having a dual multi-phase microstructure, and the intermetallic compounds were examined for mechanical properties. Examples 1 to 5 Cast materials of Reference Example 1 and Examples 1 to 5 were prepared by melting and casting raw metals of Ni, Al, V and Nb (each having a purity of 99.9% by weight), and B and TiC powders (having a particle size of approximately 1 to 3 μm) in the proportions shown as No. 1 to No. 6 in Table 4 in a mold in an arc melting furnace. A melting chamber of the arc melting furnace was first evacuated, and the atmosphere in the arc melting furnace is replaced with an inert gas (argon gas). Non-consumable tungsten electrodes were employed as electrodes of the furnace, and a water-cooling copper hearth was employed as the mold. In the following description, the cast materials will be referred to as “Samples”. In Table 4, the numerical values for TiC and B are atomic percentages relative to a composition of 100 at. % in total containing Ni, Al, V and Nb. TABLE 4 B* alloy Ni Al V Nb TiC* (wt. ppm) No. 1 base 75 9 13 3 — 100 No. 2 0.2TiC 75 9 13 3 0.2 100 No. 3 0.5TiC 75 9 13 3 0.5 100 No. 4 1.0TiC 75 9 13 3 1.0 100 No. 5 2.5TiC 75 9 13 3 2.5 100 No. 6 5.0TiC 75 9 13 3 5.0 100 *TiC and B are an extra number; the numbers are not included in the total. In Table 4, Sample No. 1 containing no TiC is Reference Example 1 (hereinafter, also referred to as base alloy), and Sample Nos. 2 to 6 containing TiC are Examples 1 to 5 of the present invention. For reference, Table 5 shows the contents of the respective elements in the samples in Table 4. (Table 5 shows atomic percentages of the respective elements on the assumption that the sum of Ni, Al, V, Nb, Ti and C (excluding B) is 100 atomic %.) The TiC added is converted on the assumption that one TiC compound is completely decomposed into one Ti atom and one C atom.)

FIG. 1 shows optical photomicrographs of the cross sections of No. 1, No. 2, No. 4 and No. 6. In FIG. 1, the photographs of (a), (b), (c) and (d) correspond to the photographs of Sample Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6, respectively. FIG. 1 shows that crystal grain refinement occurred in No. 2, No. 4 and No. 6. In addition, the observation of the cross sections of Nos. 1 to 6 has revealed that the crystal grain refinement occurred when the amount of TiC added is between 0.2 at. % and 0.5 at. %. Next, the samples prepared were subjected to the heat treatment in a vacuum at 1553 K for 5 hours as solution heat treatment. In this experiment, the solution heat treatment serves as the first heat treatment, and the subsequent furnace cooling corresponds to the cooling to the temperature at which the L12 phase and the D022 phase coexist. (Microstructure Observation) Next, microstructure observation by an SEM was performed on the samples after the heat treatment. FIGS. 2 and 3 show photographs obtained. FIG. 2 shows photographs of the metal microstructures of Sample Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6 (1000 times), and FIG. 3 shows photographs of the metal microstructures of the parent phases (matrix) in the same samples observed at a higher magnification (5000 times). In FIGS. 2 and 3, the photographs of (a), (b), (c) and (d) correspond to the photographs of Sample of Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6, respectively. FIG. 2 shows that second phase particles which are considered carbide exist in Sample Nos. 4 and 6 out of the samples containing TiC, whereas no second phase particles exist in Sample Nos. 1 and 2 (areas pointed at by arrows in FIG. 2). FIG. 3 shows that a dual multi-phase microstructure was formed in the parent phases of each sample regardless of whether TiC was added or not. FIG. 3 also shows that a primary precipitate L12 phase and a eutectoid microstructure were formed in the parent phases of each sample. The results have revealed that the dual multi-phase microstructure can be maintained even when C is introduced into an intermetallic compound through addition of TiC. (Composition Analysis) Composition analysis was performed with an EPMA (Electron Probe Micro Analyzer) on the parent phases and the carbide (second phase particles) of each sample after the heat treatment. Tables 6 and 7 show the analysis results. Table 6 shows the result of the composition analysis on the parent phases (matrix) in Sample No. 1, and Table 7 shows the result of the composition analysis on the parent phases (matrix) and the carbide (second phase particles: represented as “Dispersion” in the table) in Sample No. 6. Sample No. 1 is shown for composition comparison with Sample No. 6 in which the carbide (second phase particles) was observed. All the numerical values in Tables 6 and 7 are expressed in atomic % (at. %). TABLE 6 Base Ni Al V Nb Ti C Matrix 74.8 8.6 12.3 3.4 — — TABLE 7 5.0TiC Ni Al V Nb Ti C Matrix 73.9 9.3 10.4 1.10 3.32 1.97 Dispersion 1.59 0.016 23.0 21.6 18.3 35.5 Tables 6 and 7 show that the parent phases of Sample No. 6 have lower V and Nb concentrations and higher Ti and C concentrations than the parent phases of Sample No. 1. It is also shown that the carbide (second phase particles) of Sample No. 6 has higher V and Nb concentrations as well as higher Ti and C concentrations. It is further shown that the ratio between the Ti concentration and the C concentration is not 1:1 both in the parent phases and the carbide in Sample No. 6. These results tell that TiC added was dissolved to form a new microstructure. The results also tell that addition of TiC resulted in distribution of Ti and C to the parent phases and V and Nb to the carbide (second phase particles) to constitute respective solid solutions. The amounts of Ti and C that became the solid solution are different, suggesting that the dual multi-phase microstructure can be formed even when Ti and C, instead of TiC, are separately introduced into a sample. (Phase Identification) Next, an X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on each sample after the heat treatment for identification of the phases in the metal microstructure. FIGS. 4 to 7 show the measurement results. FIGS. 4 to 7 show X-ray diffraction profiles of Sample Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6, respectively. The marks in the drawings represent peak positions of Ni3Al (L12 phase), Ni3V (D022 phase) and TiC, which are constituent phases forming the dual multi-phase microstructure. These peak positions are represented by circular dots, triangular dots and quadrangular dots, respectively. As shown in FIGS. 4 to 7, peaks derived from TiC were observed in No. 3, No. 4 and No. 6. Peaks derived from Ni3Al (L12 phase) and Ni3V (D022 phase) were observed in all of Sample Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 6. These results have revealed that except for the peaks of TiC, no other phase than Ni3Al (L12 phase) and Ni3V (D022 phase), which are the constituent phases of the dual multi-phase microstructure, was formed in all the samples, regardless of whether TiC was added or not. It has been also revealed that the carbide (second phase particles) observed in the microstructure is TiC. (Vickers' Hardness Test) Next, a Vickers' hardness test was performed on Sample Nos. 1 to 6. In the Vickers' hardness test, a square pyramid diamond indenter was pushed into each sample at room temperature. The load was mainly 300 g, and the retention time was 20 seconds. FIG. 8 shows the test results. FIG. 8 is a graph showing the relationship between the amount of TiC added and the Vickers' hardness at room temperature. FIG. 8 shows that the hardness is the maximum when TiC is not added (approximately 550 Hv) and the hardness decreases with increase in the amount of TiC added. Generally, metals have increased hardness when including impurities. However, it has been revealed that Sample Nos. 2 to 6 have decreased Vickers' hardness despite the addition of TiC. (Tensile Test) Next, a tensile test was performed on Sample Nos. 1 to 6. The tensile test was performed in a vacuum in a temperature range from room temperature to 1173 K at a strain rate of 1.67×10−4 s−1 using a test piece with a gage size of 10×2×1 mm3. FIGS. 9 to 14 show the test results. FIGS. 9 to 14 are graphs showing the relationship of the yield strength, the tensile strength (UTS, ultimate tensile strength) and the elongation versus the temperature for Sample Nos. 1 to 6. FIGS. 9 to 14 indicate that the strength of the sample (No. 1) containing no TiC shows inverse temperature dependency up to approximately 1073 K (FIG. 9). That is, the value of the tensile strength increases with increase in temperature. Likewise, the graphs indicate that the strength of the samples (Nos. 2 to 6) containing TiC also shows inverse temperature dependency up to 873 K or 1173 K (FIGS. 10 to 14). It is also indicated that the samples show elongations of from 0.65% to 5.3% in the range of all the temperatures in the measurement at room temperature to high temperature regardless of whether TiC was added or not. Next, FIGS. 15 to 18 show the relationship of the yield strength, the tensile strength and the elongation versus the amount of TiC added. FIGS. 15 to 18 are graphs for analysis of results of the tensile test on Sample Nos. 1 to 6. FIG. 15 indicates that, at room temperature (RT), all the characteristic values of the yield strength, the tensile strength and the elongation increase with increase in the amount of TiC added, and they reach maximums when the amount of TiC added is approximately 1 atomic %. In particular, the tensile strength exceeds 1.3 GPa when the amount of TiC added is approximately 1 atomic %, and the strength property is excellent when the amount of TiC added is at least 0.2 atomic % and less than 2.5 atomic %. The values of the yield strength, the tensile strength and the elongation tend to decrease with increase in the amount of TiC added once the amount of TiC added exceeds 1 atomic %. Still, it is indicated that the characteristics are comparable or superior to those of the sample containing no TiC (No. 1). Likewise, FIG. 16 indicates that, at 873 K as in the case of room temperature, all the values of the yield strength, the tensile strength and the elongation increase with increase in the amount of TiC added, and they reach maximums when the amount of TiC added is approximately 1 atomic %. It is also indicated that the characteristic values slightly decrease or stay substantially constant once the amount of TiC added exceeds 1 atomic %. In particular, the strength characteristics are excellent when the amount of TiC added is at least 0.2 atomic % and less than 2.5 atomic %. Furthermore, FIGS. 17 and 18 indicate that the value of the elongation increases with increase in the amount of TiC added, and the value reaches a maximum or stays substantially constant once the amount of TiC added reaches approximately 1 atomic %. These results have revealed that addition of TiC resulted in enhancement of the strength (yield strength and tensile strength) of the samples at room temperature. In particular, it has been revealed that the enhancement is significant when the amount of TiC added is less than 2.5 atomic %. It has been also revealed that the ductility (elongation) is enhanced because of the addition of TiC not only at room temperature but also at high temperature. In particular, the ductility is increased with increase in the amount of TiC added until the amount reaches 1 atomic %. This is considered because C obtained through decomposition of TiC became a solid solution in the parent phases, causing solid solution strengthening, and the solid solution strengthening was effective in the low temperature range. The enhancement of the strength due to the addition of TiC is therefore significant when the temperature is from room temperature to 873 K. Since the amount of C that can become a solid solution is limited (solid solubility limit), it is considered that the strength is enhanced with increase in the amount of TiC added until the limit is reached, and the enhancement of the strength stops once the limit is reached. This is considered a reason why the strength reaches a maximum when the amount of TiC added is approximately 1%. Next, fracture surface observation was performed on each sample after the tensile test. FIGS. 19 and 20 show fracture surfaces of some of the samples. FIG. 19 shows SEM photographs (low-magnification photographs) of the fracture surfaces of Sample Nos. 1 and 4 after the tensile test at room temperature (RT), 1073 K and 1173 K, respectively. FIG. 20 shows magnified SEM photographs (high-magnification photographs) of the fracture surfaces of the samples in FIG. 19. In these drawings, (a), (b) and (c) show the fracture surfaces of Sample No. 1, and (d), (e) and (f) show the fracture surfaces of Sample No. 4. As shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, Sample No. 1 takes on an aspect of quasi-cleavage fracture at room temperature and increases the tendency of intergranular fracture with increase in temperature. The intergranular fracture was completely dominated at 1173 K ((a), (b) and (c) in FIGS. 19 and 20). On the other hand, ductile transgranular fracture was observed in Sample No. 4 in a temperature range from room temperature to high temperature (1173 K). In addition, fracture mode having a dimple pattern was observed around the carbide (second phase particles) ((d), (e) and (f) in FIGS. 19 and 20). It was observed that the carbide was coarsened and thereby the cracking was caused when a large amount of carbide was added. These results suggest that addition of TiC leads to inhibition of intergranular fracture, thereby causing transgranular fracture. Accordingly, the ductility is improved. In addition, observation of the carbide has revealed that carbon contributes to the ductility when added in an appropriate amount. In addition, the same experiment was performed with 75 at. % of Ni, 9 at. % of Al, 13 at. % of V, 3 at. % of Nb, from 0 to 5.0 at. % of NbC and 100 ppm by weight of B (the NbC content was relative to Ni, Al, V and Nb totaling 100 atomic %). As a result, it has been confirmed that, as in the case of Nos. 2 to 6 (Examples 1 to 5), the tensile strength and the ductility characteristics were enhanced (the enhancement was significant when the amount of NbC added was less than 2.5 atomic % in particular as in the case of the addition of TiC). This has also confirmed that C contributes to the enhancement of the tensile strength and the ductility characteristics. Examples 6 to 11 Furthermore, other samples were prepared as Reference Example 2 and Examples 6 to 11, and examined for the mechanical properties. Cast materials of Reference Example 2 and Examples 6 to 11 were prepared in the same manner as in Sample Nos. 1 to 6 except for the composition of the raw metal materials. That is, instead of using TiC powders as a material, raw metals of Ni, Al, V and Ti (each having a purity of 99.9% by weight), and C and B powders in the proportions shown as No. 7 to No. 13 in Table 8 were used as the materials. These materials were melted and casted in a mold in an arc melting furnace to prepare the cast materials. The atmosphere in the arc melting furnace was the same as in the preparation of Sample Nos. 1 to 6, and the electrodes and the mold were also the same as in the preparation of Sample Nos. 1 to 6. In Table 8, Sample No. 7 containing no C is Reference Example 2 (also referred to as base alloy), and Sample Nos. 8 to 13 containing C are Examples 6 to 11 of the present invention. In Table 8, the numerical values for B and C are atomic percentages relative to a composition of 100 at. % in total containing Ni, Al, V and Ti. C is expressed also in ppm by weight for reference in addition to atomic %.

(As in the case of Examples 1 to 5, the solution heat treatment serves as the first heat treatment, and the subsequent furnace cooling corresponds to the cooling to the temperature at which the L12 phase and the D022 phase coexist.) (Microstructure Observation) Next, microstructure observation by an SEM was performed on Sample Nos. 7 to 13 prepared. FIGS. 21 to 24 show the photographs. FIGS. 21 to 24 show the SEM photographs of Sample Nos. 7 to 13, among which FIGS. 21 and 22 show low-magnification photographs (1000 times), and FIGS. 23 and 24 show high-magnification photographs (5000 times) of the parent phases (matrix) of the same samples. In FIGS. 21 to 24, (a) corresponds to No. 7, (b) corresponds to No. 8, (c) corresponds to No. 9, (d) corresponds to No. 10, (e) corresponds to No. 11, (f) corresponds to No. 12, and (g) corresponds to No. 13. FIGS. 21 and 22 show that the second phase particles, which are considered the carbide, exist in Sample Nos. 9 to 13 containing at least 0.3 at. % of C, and the second phase particles do not exist in Sample Nos. 7 and 8. The result has reveled that the second phase particles are formed when C is at least 0.3 at. % under the conditions that the amount of C to be added increased while fixing the amount of Ti to be added. In addition, FIGS. 23 and 24 indicate that the dual multi-phase microstructure is formed regardless of whether C was added or not and of the amount of C added. That is, it is revealed that a primary precipitate L12 phase and a eutectoid microstructure are formed in the parent phase of each sample. The microstructure observation has revealed that the dual multi-phase microstructure is maintained even when Ti and C are separately introduced into each intermetallic compound (even when the amount of C to be added is increased while fixing the amount of Ti to be added) as in the cases of the addition of TiC (the cases of Sample Nos. 1 to 6). (Composition Analysis) Composition analysis was performed with an EPMA on the parent phase and the carbide (second phase particles) of Sample Nos. 7 and 13. Table 9 shows the analysis results. Table 9 shows the results of the composition analysis on Sample Nos. 7 and 13. The composition analysis was performed on the parent phase of Sample No. 7, and on the parent phase and the carbide (second phase particles) of Sample No. 13. All the numerical values in Table 8 are expressed in atomic % (at. %). TABLE 9 No. 13 No. 7 4.0C—Ti 4.0C—Nb 0C—Ti (base) parent phase carbide Ni 74.78 74.90 2.56 Al 8.94 9.73 0.20 V 12.24 10.42 39.91 Ti 4.04 4.09 8.93 C — 0.86 48.39 Table 9 shows that the parent phase of Sample No. 13 has almost the same composition as the parent phase of Sample No. 7 except for the V concentration, which is lower than that of Sample No. 7. Table 9 also shows that the carbide (second phase particles) of Sample No. 13 has a (V,Ti)C-type composition. It has been revealed that the carbide of Sample No. 13 has a composition including V, Ti and C as main components, in which Ti is less than V. (Tensile Test) Next, a tensile test was performed on Sample Nos. 7 to 13. The tensile test was performed in a vacuum in a temperature range from room temperature to 1173 K at a strain rate of 1.67×10−4 s−1 using a test piece with a gage size of 10×2×1 mm3. FIGS. 25 to 32 show the test results. FIGS. 25 to 28 are graphs showing the relationship of the yield strength, the tensile strength (UTS, ultimate tensile strength) and the elongation versus the C concentration for Sample Nos. 7 to 13. As for the testing temperature, FIG. 25 corresponds to room temperature (RT), FIG. 26 corresponds to 873 K, FIG. 27 corresponds to 1073 K, and FIG. 28 corresponds to 1173 K. FIG. 25 indicates that at room temperature (RT), the characteristic values of the tensile strength and the elongation tend to increase with increase in the amount of C added. The tensile strength increases when the amount of C added is 0.1 atomic %, at which the tensile strength is higher than that of the sample containing no C (No. 7). (In particular, the tensile strength is stable when the amount of C added is at least 0.5 atomic %.) In addition, when the amount of C added is more than 0.1 atomic % (for example, 0.3 atomic %), the elongation is higher than that of the sample containing no C. (The elongation is significantly higher when the amount of C added is at least 2.0 atomic %.) FIG. 26 indicates that even at 873 K, the characteristic value of the elongation increases with increase in the amount of C added. When the amount of C added is more than 0.1 atomic % (for example, 0.3 atomic %), the elongation is higher than that of the sample containing no C (No. 7), and the tendency is significant when the amount of C added is at least 0.5 atomic %. Furthermore, FIGS. 27 and 28 indicate that the similar tendency takes place at 1073 K and 1173 K. It is indicated that at 1073K and 1173K, all the values of the yield strength, the tensile strength and the elongation increase with increase in the amount of C added. As described above, it is revealed that the strength (tensile strength) and the elongation of the samples were enhanced by the addition of C to the base composition in a wide temperature range from room temperature to high temperature. 1.
