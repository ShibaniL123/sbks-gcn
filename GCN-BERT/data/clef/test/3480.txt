N-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine
1-Fluoro-3-iodopropane (5.4 μl, 0.050 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.013 mL, 0.070 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of N-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)azetidin-3-amine (22 mg, 0.050 mmol) in NMP (0.4 mL) at ambient temperature. After 16 hours the crude reaction was purified directly by reverse phase preparative HPLC (Waters XBridge C18 column, 19 mm diameter, 100 mm length, 5 μm silica), elution gradient 40 to 70% MeCN in water containing 0.2% ammonium hydroxide as a modifier. Product fractions were concentrated to dryness to afford N-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (9 mg, 36%) as a pale yellow solid.
