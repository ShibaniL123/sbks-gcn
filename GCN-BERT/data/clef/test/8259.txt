Preparation of of 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (3.14 mL, 18.6 mmol) was added dropwise via syringe over 5 minutes to a stirred solution of 2,2,2-trifluoroethan-1-ol (1.23 mL, 16.9 mmol) and 2,6-dimethylpyridine (2.36 mL, 20.3 mmol) in DCM (50 mL) at −10° C. After 2 hours the reaction was washed successively with aqueous HCl (1N; 2×30 mL) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (20 mL). The organic layer was then dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (0.92 g, 23%) as a red oil.
