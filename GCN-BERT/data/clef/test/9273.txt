PRIORITY 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutic compound of nilotinib (Formula I) that is present in a solubilized or amorphous state. Such a pharmaceutical composition further comprises at least one organic acid which functions as a solubilizing agent, increasing the bioavailability of nilotinib and suppressing the food effect associated with certain compositions of nilotinib. 2. Background of the Invention Nilotinib is 4-Methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-N[5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] benzamide. A particularly useful salt of nilotinib is nilotinib hydrochloride monohydrate. These therapeutic compounds have utility as inhibitors of the protein tyrosine kinase (TK) activity of Bcr-Abl. Examples of conditions that may be treated by such therapeutic compounds include, but are not limited to, chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. There is a need to formulate nilotinib and the other therapeutic compounds hereinafter disclosed into pharmaceutical compositions, especially solid oral dosage forms, such that the therapeutic benefits of the compounds may be delivered to a patient in need thereof. One problem to providing such compositions including nilotinib is the physiochemical properties of nilotinib, since nilotinib and its salts are poorly water soluble compounds and are difficult to formulate and deliver (i.e., made bioavailable when ingested orally). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides solublized or amorphous pharmaceutical compositions of nilotinib or a pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof using one or more organic acids that function as a solubilizing agent, increasing the bioavailability of nilotinib and suppressing the food effect associated with certain compositions of nilotinib.

As used herein the term “pharmaceutical composition” means, for example, a mixture containing a specified amount of a therapeutic compound, e.g. a therapeutically effective amount, of a therapeutic compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to be administered to a mammal, e.g., a human in order to treat kinase dependent diseases. As used herein the term “pharmaceutlcally acceptable” refers to those compounds, materials, compositions and/or dosage forms, which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for contact with the tissues of mammals, especially humans, without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response and other problem complications commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The concentration of therapeutic compound in the pharmaceutical composition is present in an amount, e.g. in a therapeutically effective amount, which will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, it is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular recipient, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the pharmaceutical compositions. The therapeutic compound may be administered once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time. Thus, an appropriate amount, e.g. an appropriate therapeutically effective amount, is known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the dose of the therapeutic compound will be in the range from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day. Exemplary unit doses of therapeutic compound range from 100 g to 1000 m, including unit dosages of 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg. Alternatively lower doses may be given, for example doses of 0.5 to 100 mg; 0.5 to 50 mg; or 0.5 to 20 mg per kilogram body weight per day. The effective dosage range of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be calculated based on the weight of the active moiety to be delivered. If the salt exhibits activity itself, the effective dosage may be estimated as above using the weight of the salt, or by other means known to those skilled in the art. As used herein the term “immediate-release” refers to the rapid release of the majority of the therapeutic compound, e.g., greater than about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, or about 90% within a relatively short time, e.g., within 1 hour, 40 minutes, 30 minutes or 20 minutes after oral ingestion. Particularly useful conditions for immediate-release are release of at least or equal to about 80% of the therapeutic compound within thirty minutes after oral ingestion. The particular immediate-release conditions for a specific therapeutic compound will be recognized or known by one of ordinary skill in the art. As used herein the term “modified-release” refers to slower release of the majority of the therapeutic compound as compared to immediate release dosage forms, e.g., greater than about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, or about 90% within a relatively short time, e.g., within 1 hour, 40 minutes, 30 minutes or 20minutes after oral ingestion. Particularly useful conditions for modified-release are release of at least or equal to about 80% of the therapeutic compound after thirty minutes after oral ingestion. The particular modified-release conditions for a specific therapeutic compound will be recognized or known by one of ordinary skill in the art. As used herein the term “excipient” refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient that is commonly used in the pharmaceutical technology for preparing granule and/or solid oral dosage formulations. Examples of categories of excipients include, but are not limited to, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, glidants, stabilizers, fillers and diluents. One of ordinary skill in the art may select one or more of the aforementioned excipients with respect to the particular desired properties of the granule and/or solid oral dosage form by routine experimentation and without any undue burden. The amount of each excipient used may vary within ranges conventional in the art. The following references which are all hereby incorporated by reference disclose techniques and excipients used to formulate oral dosage forms. See The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 4th edition, Rowe et a., Eds., American Pharmaceuticals Association (2003); and Remington; the Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th edition, Gennaro, Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2000). As used herein, the term “wet granulation” refers to the general process of using a granulation liquid in the granulation process to subsequently form granules, as discussed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition (2000), Chapter 45. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the invented solid dosage forms of nilotinib can be prepared by dry granulation, wet granulation, roller compaction, melt extrusion, spray drying, desolvation, melting followed by rapid solidification and precipitation by solvent-antisolvent processes including supercritical fluids. The present invention also provides a method of increasing bioavailability by administering the composition or the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, respectively, to an animal or to a patient, wherein the increased bioavailability is determined by comparing the Cmax value or the AUC value of the composition or the pharmaceutical composition of the invention with the composition disclosed in the present invention. Preferably the method increases bioavailability of a drug in administered animal or patient by least 1.3 fold, preferably at least two fold, even more preferably by at least three fold. In one preferred embodiment of the method, the composition or the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, respectively, comprises 4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-N-[5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] benzamide and the increased bioavailability of nilotinib is least 1.3 fold, preferably at least two fold, even more preferably by at least three fold when compared with 4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-N-[5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] benzamide in the marketed Tasigna™ hard-gelatin capsule manufactured by Novartis. Bioavailability can be measured by skilled artisan by conventional methods. For example, tablets, capsules, liquids, powders, etc., are given orally to humans or animals and blood levels are measured. The present invention also provides a method of reducing food effect by administering the composition or the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, respectively, to an animal or to a patient. “Food effect” in this application is defined as the ratio of the Cmax and/or AUC values of the tested drug in fed dog versus fasted dog. If the ratio is above 1, preferably above 1.1, it is considered the tested drug has food effect. Measuring the Cmax and/or AUC values of the tested drug in fed dog and in fasted dog is standard practice in the art, exemplified by example 2 of the present application. Reduction of food effect can be determined by comparing the value of the ratio from the composition or pharmaceutical composition of the invention and the value of a composition without the solubilized form disclosed in the present invention. Preferably the composition or the pharmaceutical composition of the invention has at least 15% reduced food effect, preferably 20%, preferably 25%, preferably 30%, preferably 40%, reduced food effect. In one embodiment of the method, the composition comprises solubilized or amorphous 4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-N-[5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] benzamide and having at least 15% reduced food effect, preferably 20%, preferably 25%, preferably 30%, preferably 40%, when compared with 4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-N-[5-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] benzamide in a marketed Tasigna™ hard-gelatin capsule manufactured by Novartis and used as the reference product in this invention.

EXAMPLE 1 Nilotinib Lactic Acid Formulation It was surprisingly found that nilotinib had a very high solubility in lactic acid (>600 mg/ml at 65° C.) and could maintain its solubility at intestinal pH in presence of surfactants and/or polymers. Nilotinib solubilized modified release solid dosage forms containing lactic acid were developed. This formulation demonstrated higher bioavailability in both fasted and fed condition compared to FMI, and suppressed the food effect associated with nilotinib. Surfactants and/or polymers were used to prevent the precipitation after solubilized nilotinib is released from the formulation matrix. Due to the liquid nature of lactic acid this formulation matrix is in the liquid form. However, by incorporation of additional suitable excipients, the formulation could be solidified at room temperature. This improved the physical and chemical stability of nilotinib in the formulation. In addition, the solid state also provided the opportunity to modulate the drug release rate. Examples of nilotinib lactic acid formulations are described in Table 1. TABLE 1 Nilotinib solubilized formulation containing lactic acid Ingredient (mg/dose) Formulation A Formulation B Nilotinib free base 100 200 Lactic acid 175 350 Poloxamer 407 60 70 Vitamine TPGS 50 60 HPMC 3 cps 100 150 PEG3350 160 — Total 645 830 In these formulations, lactic acid was used to dissolve nilotinib and maintain nilotinib in the liquid/solubilized state. Poloxamer 407 and Vitamin E TPGS polymer and/or surfactant, respectively, were used as precipitation inhibitors and in addition these excipients are also known CYP3A4 & Pg-P inhibitors. The dual function of these polymers is also critical for improving the bioavailability. HPMC 3 cps was used as the control release agent. PEG3350 was used as a solidifying agent to convert the formulation to a solid state at RT. Manufacturing Process 1. The blend of Poloxamer 407, Vitamin-E TPGS and/or PEG3350 was heated to 65° C. to form a clear solution (solution A). 2. AMN107 free base was dissolved in lactic acid at 65° C. (solution B). 3. Mix solution A and B, and then add HPMC 3 cps to form a suspension 4. The molten suspension was filled in Size 0/00 capsules and allowed to solidify at room temperature. Two step Dissolution: 37° C., 500 ml pH 2 buffer to 1000 ml pH 8.8 buffer. USP Paddle at 75 rpm. It shows that Formulation B is a modified release formulation and nilotinib precipitation could be inhibited after its release from the matrix. In case of the FMI (reference Tasigna capsules), nilotinib precipitates immediately after switching media pH from 2 to 8.8 (FIG. 1). Dog PK Study FIGS. 2 and 3 summarize dog PK data (Cmax and AUC) of Formulation B (200 mg nilotinib) in the fasted and fed conditions. This formulation shows higher bioavailability in both fasted and fed conditions in dogs compared to FMI, and suppresses the food effect associated with nilotinib. Chemical Stability Nilotinib has demanding purity and stability requirements for a mutagenic impurity 371-03 (<3 ppm at release and <6 ppm during stability). Formulation B exhibits impurity levels of 2.3 ppm at the initial time point, but exhibits impurity levels of 19.4 ppm after 1 month storage at RT, which is over the 6 ppm specification limit. This specification has been set for the FMI. The reason for this increase is due to the high percentage of water content (10% w/w) in the lactic acid. In order to overcome this stability concern, use of pure lactic acid and storage under refrigeration at 2-8° C. is recommended. EXAMPLE 2 Nilotinib Citric Acid Solid Dosage Formulations In order to overcome this stability issue of lactic acid solubilized nilotinib solid dosage forms, solid organic acids were considered. Surprisingly, citric acid was found to provide remarkably high solubility of the drug in ethanol. This approach allowed development of a proprietary spray drying process as a means to generate solubilized solid dosage form of nilotinib. The resulting AMN107 solubilized drug intermediate was compressed into MR (fast and slow release) tablets with additional external excipients, which showed good chemical stability and also suppressed the food effect in dogs. Examples of compositions of solubilized solid AMN107 spray dried drug intermediates are described in Table 2. TABLE 2 Compositions of solubilized intermediates of nilotinib using citric acid. Ingredient Nilotinib Nilotinib (mg/dose) intermediate A intermediate B Nilotinib HCl 220 220 Citric acid, 300 300 anhydrate PVP K30 200 250 Vitamin E — 35 TPGS Total 720 805 FIGS. 4-7 shows that the Nilotinib intermediate A and B is amorphous with Tg of 77.42° C. and 81.64° C. respectively and can adsorb ˜5% (w/w) water at 25° C. and 50% RH. Intermediate A was mixed with additional external phase excipients and compressed into tablets. Examples of these tablets are described in Table 3. An IR capsule was also included as a reference to compare with the IR tablet to determine the effect of tablet compression.

All the ingredients except magnesium stearate were passed through No.35 mesh and blended (200 revolutions). 2. Magnesium stearate (internal) was added to step 1 and blended (80 revolutions). 3. The blend was roller compacted. 4. The ribbon was milled and screened through No. 18 mesh. 5. The external magnesium stearate was added to the granules from step 4 and blended (80 revolutions). This final blend was then compressed. For capsule, no external magnesium stearate was added before filling into capsules MR tablet B (fast) and MR tablet C (slow) were dry blended as described in the following steps. 1. All the ingredients except magnesium stearate were passed through No.35 mesh and blended (200) revolutions. 2. Magnesium stearate was added to step 1 and blended (80 revolutions). The final blend was compressed into tablets. Chemical Stability MR tablet A exhibited mutagenic impurity levels of 2.05 ppm at the initial time. After 1 month storage at 40° C. and 75% RH, if exhibited impurity levels of 2.3 ppm in the presence of 1 g desiccant while, impurity levels of 12.8 ppm in the absence of desiccant were observed which is above the specification limits. This data therefore justifies the need for the desiccant for long-term stability. Physical Stability FIG. 8 summarizes XRD of AMN107 MR tablet B and C after 8 months storage at 25° C. and 60% RH. After 6 months under these conditions, AMN107 MR tablet B and C, respectively, maintained their amorphous nature. Dissolution Two step dissolution conditions used for the following nilotinib formulations, IR capsule, IR tablet and MR tablet B (fast) are: 37° C.; Step 1, 0-60 minutes 500 ml pH 2 buffer, Step 2, >60 minutes 1000 ml pH 6.8 buffer; Paddle at 75 rpm. Two step dissolution conditions used for MR tablet C (slow) are; 37° C.; Step 1, 0-120 minutes 500 ml pH 2 buffer, Step 2, 120-180 minutes 1000 ml pH 6.8 buffer; Paddle at 75 rpm. The dissolution data for IR tablet and capsule and MR tablet B (fast) and MR tablet C (slow) are summarized in FIGS. 9 and 10. It can be seen that the IR capsule has a faster dissolution rate compared to the IR tablet. MR Tablet B (fast) containing Eudragit L100-55 shows a slightly slower release rate in pH 2 and higher supersaturation in pH 6.8 compared to IR tablet without Eudragit L100-55. Eudragit L100-55 is an anionic polymer soluble at pH 6.8 and provides inhibition of precipitation. Thus the use of other precipitation inhibitors is expected to provide similar supersaturation. The slow release MR tablet C formulation was developed through screening of several viscosity grade polymers and subsequent selection of an appropriate polymer. The selected polymer, HPMC K100 LV CR had the required viscosity and provided the expected release profile. As can be seen from FIG. 10, the MR tablet C (slow) containing Eudragit L100-55 and HPMC K100 LV CR demonstrated a slow release in pH 2. Dog PK Data 50 mg Nilotinib MR (fast & slow) formulations solubilized using citric acid were tested in dogs. The solid-Suspeneded MicroEmulsion (SSME) formulation previously tested in the clinic was used as the control since it showed a higher bioavailability and moderate suppression of food effect in the human clinical study compared to FMI and thus was deemed to be a better reference to be compared with. The results (FIGS. 11 and 12) show that both IR and MR tablet exhibited enhanced nilotinib bioavailability under both fasted and fed conditions in dogs. As a result, both IR and MR (slow release) nilotinib formulations exhibited no food effects.
