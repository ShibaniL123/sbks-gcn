DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Aspects of the invention provide wearable devices, wearable robotic devices, and systems methods, and computer-program products utilizing the same. Aspects of the invention can be utilized not only by human subjects, but also by animals such as canines. For example, aspects of the invention can be utilized by solders or law enforcement officers, as well as service dogs. Embodiments of the invention provide an active haptic exoskeleton device that can be used, for example, as: a device used for haptic interaction with 5-D stem cell data, a wearable assistive and rehabilitative device for strength augmentation of the hand, and a commercial device for virtual reality and perception augmentation (gaming). Aspects of the invention serve these goals by augmenting forces as well as delivering textural feedback to each individual fingertip. In some embodiments of the invention, each finger can be controlled by two actuator cables that mimic the flexor and extensor tendons of the hand. A vibrotactile motor can be located at each fingertip and can be used to simulate the texture of a virtual surface. The artificial tendons run through pathways knitted into the glove and attach to the actuators mounted on the wrist cuff. The two actuators for each finger work in unison, receiving force feedback data from two sensors mounted in each fingertip, actively adapting to the natural motion of the hand. The glove can then augment this natural motion to simulate forces on the hand. In conjunction with the vibrotactile stimulus, this creates an immersive haptic experience unlike any commercial or academic system. The same glove can provide remote rehabilitation as well as strength augmentation to patients, revolutionizing the field of rehabilitative and assistive robotics. One embodiment of the invention includes: an exoskeletal glove outer-layer, a sensor glove under-layer, a tendon-driving actuator cuff, and a control array. The knitted semi-rigid exoskeletal outer layer is unlike anything ever seen. It revolutionizes the state of the art by combining the concepts of rigid and soft exoskeletons, gaining the benefits of each. The layer is knitted and steamed using techniques that ensure the tendon pathways are aligned and kept open. It is able to provide a near frictionless guide for the artificial tendons that allow for lossless force transmittance to the fingertip. The actuator tendon pathways were designed to mimic the flexor and extensor tendons of the hand and is the first device to seamlessly mimic and drive both sets of tendons with a hand-mounted actuating system. Current systems use large bulky exoskeletons that are impractical for most use cases and restrict the natural motion of the hand. Embodiments of the invention fit like a glove and are completely non-restrictive. The knitted sensor under-layer holds the fingertip FSRs (force sensing resistors) in place as well as neatly guides the wires necessary for communication with the control array (10 per finger, 50 total). Conductive yarn is used to create the necessary conductive pathways, allowing the sensor glove to be thin and non-obstructive to the hand's natural motion. All wires can be fed into a pin-out port on the wrist so the glove can easily be disconnected from the control array for mobility purposes. No current technologies use a bi-layer approach or conductive yarn as a signal transmission method. The placement of the force sensors in the fingertip of the system is also unique. The sensors are in constant contact with both the fingertip and exoskeletal layer, allowing for instantaneous and accurate localized force readings. The wrist cuff with tendon actuator array is also an entirely new method for driving the exoskeleton. This is the first system to place ten independently controlled tendon actuators on the hand of the user, as well as the first system to actively articulate each finger independently using a mimicked flexor and extensor tendon. Previous technologies drive the exoskeleton using off- arm methods that introduce friction and lag into the force transmission system. By placing the actuators as close to the fingertip as possible, most traditional sources of friction and cable drag are eliminated. Having on-hand actuators also allows the exoskeleton to be a standalone system, requiring no tether to a bulky driving mechanism. This key factor allows the system to be a wearable robotic grip assistive device or constant-contact rehabilitative system. The semi-rigid knitted exo-skin was created using the SHIMA SEIKI® WHOLEGARMENT® knitting machine model SWG041N available from Shima Seiki Manufacturing, Ltd. of Wakayama, Japan. It was designed using Shima' s proprietary software, creating a "program" that can be read by any machine to produce the desired product. Each finger consists of three semi-rigid segments that fit over the proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. Stretchable segments connect these semi-rigid pieces, allowing for a full range of motion of the DIP (distal interphalangeal), PIP (proximal interphalangeal), and MCP (metacarpophalangeal) joints. Knitted padding can be incorporated into the top of each stretchable segment to prevent wear on the knuckle from the cable. Actuated flexor and extensor cables run along the top and bottom of each finger, each attaching to the tip of the distal phalange. The tendons run through knitted guides that are oriented during the steaming process. After the glove is knitted, it is placed on a porcelain hand; rods are forced through the tendon guides, and the glove is steamed. The steaming process causes the glue yarn in the semi-rigid segments to harden, taking the shape of the porcelain finger as well as fixing the cable guides in the proper orientation. The thin sensor underlayer can include of ten force sensing resistors (FSRs), one on top and bottom of each distal phalange. The sensors can be secured to the under glove, and conductive yarn can be used to create the necessary wiring pathway to the wrist cuff of the glove. The yarn follows a specific zigzag pathway delineated by pointelle holes incorporated into the knitted design. The twenty wires running from the fingertip FSRs as well as the ten wires running from the fingertip vibro-tactile motors can attach to a pin-out port on the wrist cuff for ease of coupling to a control device (e.g. , an ARDUINO® microcontroller). Base Layer for Wearable Robotic Devices Referring now to FIG. 1A, a glove 100 is provided. Glove 100 includes a plurality of fingers 102a-102e. As labeled in the context of thumb 102a, each of the fingers 102 can include one or more compliant regions 104 (fabricated from green yarn in FIG. 1) and flexible, but less compliant regions 106 (fabricated from grey yarn in FIG. 1). The compliant regions 104 can be posited for placement over a joint of a subject's hand. Similarly, the flexible, but less compliant regions 106 can be coupled to the compliant regions 104. In such a manner, the flexible, but less compliant regions 106 can be positioned over the subject's bones in order to mimic the subject's anatomy and/or provide support to the user. The glove 100 can be made from a variety of materials such as textiles and elastomers. Textiles advantageously provide excellent compliance and breathability. Suitable textiles can be made from a variety of natural and synthetic fibers such as natural fibers, cotton, wool, silk, hemp, flax, animal hair, jute, modal, cellulose, bamboo, pina, ramie, nettles, milkweed, seaweed, metals, manufactured fibers, azlon, acetate, triacetate, viscose, lyocell, glass, graphite carbon, carbon fiber, carbon nanotube, liquid crystal, ceramics, polyesters, aramids, para-aramids, meta- aramids, aromatic polyesters, rayon, acrylics, modacrylics, polyacrylonitrile, polylactides (PLAs), polyamides, polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6, rubber lastrile, lastol, polyethylene (PE), high- density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), vinyl, vinyon, vinylidene chloride, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), polybenzimidazole (PBI), novoloid, melamine, anidex, nytril, elastoester, nylon, spandex/elastane, olefins, biosynthetic polymers, and blends of the same. Suitable aramids, para-aramids, and meta-aramids are sold under the KEVLAR® and NOMEX® brands by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Delaware, under the TECHNORA® brand by Teijin Limited of Osaka, Japan, and under the TWARON® brand by Teijin Aramid B.V. of Arnhem, The Netherlands. Suitable aromatic polyesters are available under the VECTRAN® and VECTRAN® EX brands from Kuraray America, Inc. of Fort Mill, South Carolina. Differences in compliance between complaint regions 104 and flexible, but less compliant regions 106 can be achieved using a variety of techniques. For example, the compliant regions 104 can be made from textiles having thinner fibers than flexible, but less compliant regions 106. In another example, flexible, but less compliant regions 106 can have a denser and/or tighter weave, knit, or the like. In yet another example, the flexible, but less compliant regions 106 can be treated to decrease their compliance as discussed below. Generally speaking, flexible, but less compliant regions 106 can be treated by applying energy to fuse, melt, cross-link, or otherwise increase the rigidity of the textiles, especially synthetic textiles. For example, infrared, ultraviolet, RF, microwave, ultrasound, or other forms of energy can be applied to the textile. For example, glove 100 can be placed over a hand- shaped mold including energy-supplying regions corresponding to the desired locations of flexible, but less compliant regions 106. For example, energy- supplying regions can include a plurality of vents adapted and configured to release hot air or steam into flexible, but less compliant regions 106. Preferably and as seen in FIG. IB, compliant regions 104 are sufficiently compliant or flexible in order to permit normal joint movement as though the subject is not wearing glove 100 or other base layer. For example, the individual yarns within a textile can be capable of elongation of between about 110% and about 130% and the textile can be capable of elongation between about 160% and about 180%. Preferably, flexible, but less compliant regions 106 are sufficiently compliant or flexible to stretch in order to permit an adjacent joint (an interphalangeal joint) to pass through the flexible, but less compliant regions 106 before compressing slightly against the adjacent bones. For example, the textile can have an elongation between about 95% and about 115%, which can be further reduced to between about 91% and about 111% by steam treatment. Flexible, but less compliant regions 106 can include one or more elastic regions 108 (fabricated from black yarn in FIGS. 1A and IB) that permit stretching of the flexible, but less compliant regions 106 when passing over joints. Suitable elastic materials include spandex, which is available, for example, under the LYCRA® trademark from Invista North America S.A.R.L. of Wichita, Kansas. Textiles for compliant regions 104 and flexible, but less compliant regions 106 can be formed using a variety of manual or automated means. For example, textiles can be formed using an industrial knitting machine. Knitting is the intermeshing of yarns into loops resulting in fabrics. In particular, knitting is the process of creating fabric with yarns by forming a series of interconnected loops. For example, textiles can be formed using an industrial flatbed knitting machine. Three-dimensional knitted shapes can be made using various loop configuration (knit stitches) such as knit and purl, tuck, miss, and the like and/or various shaping techniques such as flechage, bindoff, tubular half gauge and the like. In one embodiment, plissage is used under finger segments to facilitate bending and kinematic mimicry and ensure that fabric does not pile up under joints when bending fingers. All techniques can be used individually or in combinations with one another within the same structure. Glove 100 can include padding 110a, 110b in regions where tendons 112 (discussed below) pass over an articulation point of the subject's anatomy and/or where one or more actuators and/or other electromechanical elements are located. Padding 110 can include adding knitting, layers, or compressible materials (e.g. , foams). In some embodiments, one or more layers of the glove can fold over to cover actuators and/or other electromechanical elements. Although a glove 100 is depicted, the base layer described herein can be applied to any anatomical joint including, but not limited to, a hand joint, an elbow joint, a wrist joint, a shoulder joint, a sternoclavicular joint, a vertebral joint, a temporomandibular joint, a sacroiliac joint, a hip joint, a knee joint, an ankle joint, a foot joint, and the like. Wearable Robotic Devices Still referring to FIG. 1A, another aspect of the invention provides a wearable robotic device that combines glove 100 or other base layer with actuators. Actuators can be adapted and configured to move the flexible, but less compliant regions 106 relative to each other. For example, actuators can facilitate flexion, extension, abduction, or adduction of a joint. Such movement can be achieved through applying tension or compression to one side of the joint. Still referring to FIG. 1 A, one exemplary embodiment of invention utilizes a plurality of tendons 112 that apply tension to one or more sides of bone. Tendons 112 can be fabricated from a variety of materials such as wires, cables, strings, ropes, twine, and/or the fibers discussed herein in the context of textiles. Tendons 112 can be woven through the base material of the glove and can be optionally sheathed. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 1, a plurality of knitted tendon pathways 114 can sit proud of the glove surface and allow tendon 112 to run along the outside of glove 100. Referring now to FIG. 2, tendons 112 can be manipulated one or more motors 202 such as a DC motor, a stepper motor, a servomotor, and the like. Motors 202 can apply tension to tendons 112 in order cause the desired motion of the underlying joint. For example, motor 202 can turn a winch 204 to draw in or release tendon 112. A variety of other actuators can be used such as linear actuators, electroactive polymers (EAPs), pneumatic muscles, and the like. Although glove 200 includes a plurality of rigid members 206 fabricated from molded plastic, the principles discussed herein apply with equal force. The dorsal side of glove 200 is shown in FIG. 2B. As can be seen, parallel structures are present on the dorsal side in order to facilitate extension of one or more fingers. Opposing Force Sensors Referring now to FIG. 3A, one aspect of the invention utilizes one or more pairs of opposing force sensors 302a, 302b to detect and augment desired motions. For example, a first force sensor 302a can be positioned on the palmar surface of a finger and a second force sensor 302b can be positioned on a dorsal surface of the finger. Additionally or alternatively, a first force sensor can be positioned on a medial surface of the finger and a second force sensor can be positioned on a lateral surface of the finger. Force sensors 302 can be positioned on some or all fingers or portions of fingers in order to provide high fidelity sensing of desired movements. Referring now to FIG. 3B, force sensors can be positioned within pockets 304 formed by one or more protective layers of gloves (constructed from black yarn in FIG. 3B). The layers formed from black yarn can fold back over the fingers to protect and hide all electronic components. Control Software and/or Hardware for Wearable Robotics Another aspect of the invention provides control software and/or hardware for detecting forces applied to force sensors 302, determining desired characteristics of desired movement, and then controlling motors in order to move finger or other limb accordingly. For example, a controller can actuate motors for as long as a sufficient amount of force is applied to the relevant force sensor 302. Tactile Interactions with Computer-Generated Structures Referring now to FIG. 4, another aspect of the invention provides a system 400 for providing tactile interactions with computer-generated structures. System 400 includes wearable robotic device 402 such as the gloves described herein, one or more sensors 404, and a computer 406. Sensor(s) 404 can be adapted and configured to detect a position of the glove 402 within a three-dimensional space. For example, sensor(s) 402 can detect and generate a three - dimensional point representing the location of each finger tip. Suitable sensors are available under the LEAP MOTION™ trademark from Leap Motion, Inc. of San Francisco, California and described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2013/182077, 2013/182079, 2013/182897, 2013/182902, and 2014/028861. Computer 406 can be a general or special purpose computer containing instructions stored in hardware or software. An exemplary algorithm 500 is described below in the context of FIG. 5. In step S502, the computer loads one or more computer-generated structures. The computer-generated structures can be 2-D or 3-D structures and can also include additional dimensionality that can be represented in display colors or through tactile feedback as will be discussed further herein. The computer-generated structures can be generated based on real- world data such as imaging or can be abstract elements created organically. For example, the computer-generated structures can be derived from medical or scientific imaging data produced using a technique such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography, positron emission topography (PET), computed tomography (CT), diffuse optical tomography, elastography, electrical impedance tomography, 3-D microscopy, 3-D confocal laser microscopy, and the like. In step S504, the position of at least a portion of the subject's body is mapped with respect to one or more computer-generated structures. This information can be determined using sensor(s) 404 as discussed above. In step S506, the position at least a portion of the subject's body is mapped relative to the one or more computer-generated structure. For example, computer 406 can determine whether a point associated with any of the subject's fingers lies outside, within, or adjacent to a computer- generated structure. In step S508, the computer 406 displays the position of at least a portion of the subject' s body and the computer-generated structures on a display device. The position of the subject' s body can be depicted as one or more points or can include an image of the relevant body parts (e.g. , fingers or hands). In step S510, the computer 406 controls the one or more actuators in the glove 402 to inhibit, enhance, augment, and/or induce movement based on interactions with the computer- generated structures and/or other subjects using system 400. For example, computer 406 can control actuators to inhibit movement of the subject' s fingers if the subject contacts a computer-generated object in a similar manner to a desk applying upward force to one' s fingers if the fingers contact a fixed object while a hand is moving downward. This feature can advantageously enhance the subject's interactions with the computer-generated structures. Additionally, this aspect of the invention allows the subject to interact with structures that are outside of the subject's field of view. For example, a subject could move his virtual hand behind a computer-generated structure (e.g. , a structure representing a human stem cell) to feel the surface geometry of the rear of the structure and/or where and how the structure interfaces with other structures (e.g. , blood vessels). Additionally, this aspect of the invention enables a subject to virtually interact with the physical properties of a structure such as the structure' s rigidity. For example, certain structures can have a spongy surface that is represented to the subject by providing less resistance to movement of the subject's fingers. Other structures can have more rigid surfaces that produce a more pronounced resistance to movement of the subject' s fingers. In another example, movement can be enhanced. For example, a subject's fingers can be moved to physically represent fluid or ion flows or to draw the subject' s fingers in the direction of various gradients. In another example, the subject' s fingers can be drawn towards interesting image regions and/or regions of an image that the subject has not yet examined in detail. In still another example, vibrotactile sensor can provide vibrations of varying patterns and/or intensity to represent additional dimensions of data such as temperature, biological activity (e.g. , as detected through fluorescent imaging), electrical potential, radioactivity, and the like. In yet another embodiment, a subject' s fingers can be manipulated by another user (e.g. , for teaching or demonstration purposes). Additionally or alternatively, feedback provided to one subject can be provided to other subjects. The feedback provided to the subject can be user-definable. For example, if a complex image was produced using a plurality of fluorescent probes (each representing different biological activities), the subject can select one or more fluorescent signals for representation through tactile feedback. Likewise, the overall intensity of feedback and/or the mapping of amplitudes of signals in the image data to tactile feedback can be adjusted by the subject. Additional Glove Embodiments Referring now to FIG. 13 A, another glove 1300 is provided including a plurality of fingers 1302. As in the glove depicted and described in the context of FIGS . 1A and IB, each of the fingers 1302 can include one or more compliant regions 1304 (fabricated from grey yarn in FIG. 13A) and flexible, but less compliant regions 1306 (fabricated from white yarn in FIG. 13A). The fingers 1302 can have a single-fabric-layer construction. In some embodiments, the finger tips can include additional fabric layers shown in the unfolded shape on finger 1302d and in the folded arrangement on fingers 1302b, 1302c, and 1302e. Still referring to FIG. 13A, tendons 1312 can loop around the each finger tip before connecting to an actuator. For example, the tendons 1312 shown in the dorsal side of fingers 1302a-1302e (and actuated to extend the fingers) can travel to the ventral side of the finger tip before returning to the ventral side and traveling along the same channels to the actuator so that two tendon strands run in parallel along channels within the glove 1300 to an actuator. In a similar manner, ventral tendons actuatable to flex the fingers can loop around the dorsal side of the fingertip. In another embodiment, the tendons 1312 can terminate on the sides of the fingertips or in any other location on the fingertips of the glove 1300. Force sensors 1315 as depicted in and described in the context of FIG. 3A can be incorporated within the fabric (e.g. , between folded layers). For example, force sensor 1315 can be coupled to the fabric using an adhesive such as silicon epoxies. Referring now to FIG. 13B, tendons 1312 can be coupled to actuators 1316. Actuators 1316 can be removably mounted on the wrist or the back of the hand, e.g. , using hook- and-loop fastening systems such as those available under the VELCRO® and VELSTRETCH® trademarks from Velcro Industries B.V. of the Netherlands Antilles. This modular system allows for actuators to be added or removed from a glove to reflect situational needs. Leads 1318 from each actuator 1316 can be gathered in a bundle interface with a control device 1320 (e.g. , an ARDUINO® microcontroller or other printed circuit board) via an interface 1322 (e.g. , a wired interface such as a 36 pin-out female header, a USB interface, and the like or a wireless interface). Control device can include or more (e.g. , 5, 10, and the like) serial controls each adapted and configured to control operation of one or more actuators. Control device 1320 can further interface with a computer through an additional interface such a serial port or a USB port. The computer can further control operation of the control device 1320 and glove 1300 through software and/or hardware. For example, code for serial communications with the control device 1320 and storage of data in a dynamic struct can written in the C++ programming language. Exact tendon lengths and fingertip interactions can be continuously updated and made available for further processing in programs such as MATLAB® software available from The Math Works, Inc. of Natick, Massachusetts. The C++-based software can interface with the MATLAB® software via one or more MEX interfaces defined by the MATLAB® software. The MATLAB® software can process and display the data in real time to provide information such as joint range of motion and capable pressure. Referring to FIG. 14, actuators 1400 can include a motor 1402 and a winch 1404 as depicted in and described in the context of FIG. 2. Actuator 1400 can further include a free- floating tensioning drum 1406 over which the tendon 1312 passes. Tensioning drum 1406 can sit adjacent to a force sensor 1408 such as a strain gauge or a piezoresistive force sensor adapted and configured to measure the amount of force applied by the tendon 1312 to the tensioning drum 1406. Such measurements can be utilized both as feedback to control operation of the motor 1402 and to sense movement by the user, which will manifest itself as increased force measurements in some actuators 1400 when tendons are extended and decreased force measurements on actuators 1400 coupled to opposing tendons 1312. Motor 1402 can include an encoder (e.g. , a magnetic encoder) that converts the angular position of the motor into electrical signals. In one embodiment, the encoder has 600-count (or 0.6°) resolution. In one embodiment, the motor 1402 is a servomotor. Covers 1410a, 1410b allow the tendon(s) 1312 to enter the actuator, while protecting internal components 1402, 1404, 1406, 1408. Actuators 1316, 1400 can be positioned at various locations, both on the glove/garment or off. FIG. 15 depicts one such embodiment in which the actuators 1316 are positioned on the forearm near the user's elbow. The tendons 1312 can extend along the forearm to the fingers through sheaths 1522. Sheaths 1522 can be designed for low friction and/or fabricated from low friction materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and can be fabricated using techniques such as extrusion, weaving, and the like. This will free the wrist and allow greater room for placement of additional actuators 1316. The additional actuators 1316 will facilitate more intricate exercises and allow for more diverse functionality. For example, four tendons 1312 running to the tip of each finger can facilitate and track every aspect of fingertip motion in 3D space. Alternately, three tendons 1312 running to each finger can exert assistive torque on the MCP vs. PIP/DIP joints independently. The sheaths 1522 (and tendons 1312 received therein) can run directly from the actuator housing via knit structures 1314 in a biomimetic implementation. The tendons 1312 can slide without perceptible friction through the routing tubes 1522 (similar to a sheathed bicycle brake cable) and emerge at the base of the finger where they can exert force along the rest of the tendon pathway. Still referring to FIG. 15, knit structures 1314 are depicted in blue in the drawings as originally filed, open skin is depicted in black in the drawings as originally filed, and tendon guiding pathways 1322 are depicted in red in the drawings as originally filed. Sheaths 1322 can be supported along the forearm using one or more bands 1524, which can be releasably attached to the arm using a releasable closure such as hook-and-loop fastening systems such as those available under the VELCRO® and VELSTRETCH® trademarks from Velcro Industries B.V. of the Netherlands Antilles. In one embodiment, the actuators can be placed in a back pack, lumbar pack, or other wearable pouch. Scalability of Gloves and Garments In one embodiment of the invention, the gloves 100, 1300 and other garments described herein can be produced in a knit in a single size and then stretched to desired size using a complementary mold before treating flexible, but less compliant regions 106, 1306. Applications of the Invention As will be readily appreciated, aspects of the invention can be applied to many different fields. For example, the wearable robotic device can be used in rehabilitation of a subject by assisting the subject's attempts to move their fingers and thereby maintaining muscle tone without the need for a physical therapist's direct manipulation of the subject's body. For example, the resistance applied by motors can be controlled to apply varying resistance to movement of a limb. Additionally or alternatively, the forces applied to the motors can be measured to assess a subject' s strength. Measurements from the glove can be recorded, transferred, and/or stored (e.g. , in an electronic medical record) and can be used to track a subject' s progress towards goals in a training and/or rehabilitation program. Additionally, measurements can be aggregated, for example, from several clients on a server, to produce baseline, model, or reference data for particular demographics (e.g. , women between 70 and 75 years of age). Movements in response to particular exercise regimens can be recorded and analyzed for strength, proper form, speed, and the like. Although hand exercises can benefit the general public, rock climbers, gymnasts, weight lifters, and musicians (e.g. , pianists, percussionists, string players, woodwind players, and brass players) may particularly benefit from such exercises. Additionally, the principles described herein can be incorporated into gloves used for golfing and/or baseball to measure whether the flexion of the subject's fingers is appropriate and/or to apply force to show the user the appropriate grip. Moreover, the principles herein can be utilized in other garments and/or soft robotics to measure positioning, force, movement, and/or form and provide biofeedback and/or training to a user. In one embodiment of the invention, the gloves and devices described herein can be used in space suits worn by astronauts and configured to provide a desired amount of resistance to movements of the astronaut while in orbit in order prevent or reduce the occurrence of muscle atrophy and/or spaceflight osteopenia due to weightlessness. The glove can also be used as a haptic device to control robotics (e.g. , during space walks). In another embodiment, the gloves and devices described herein can be used in flight suits worn by pilots (e.g. , fighter pilots) to provide additional strength when facing high G-forces during maneuvers. In other embodiments, the glove can be used as an industrial tool for factory line workers. The system can provide grip assistance when additional strength is needed and/or monitor the actions of the worker's hand (e.g. , to to prevent injury due to repetitive harmful movements that can be captured with the glove). Embodiments of the gloves described herein can be the used by persons with complete loss of hand functionality to control a compromised hand, thereby giving the user the ability to use it again. In some embodiments, the glove and control device are part of a distributed system in which a local client (e.g. , written in JAVASCRIPT®, JAVA®, C++, MATLAB®, and the like) controls the user' s interactions with the glove to exert and/or measure force and or location of the glove during a session. A medical professional (e.g. , a therapist) can optionally monitor the user's performance synchronously or asynchronously. The medical professional can consult with models of strength and range of motion appropriate for the patient and/or can define one or more goals for the user. The user can further use the client, a portal, or a smartphone, tablet, or computer application to view their history, monitor their progress toward goals, interact with a medical professional, and the like. All information about the user's performance, the medical professionals treatment parameters, and the like can be stored in and communicated via a server. This server can facilitate integration with an electronic medical record system. In another example, the wearable robotic device can be used in various industrial, law enforcement, and military applications to enhance the subject's physical abilities. Additionally, the tactile feedback aspects of the invention can be used to facilitate control of a robotic device. For example, the subject can be a surgeon controlling the operation of robotic surgery system, a mechanic controlling a robotic device to repair a difficult-to-reach component, a bomb technician diffusing an explosive device (e.g. , using a robotic device such as those available from iRobot Corporation of Bedford, Massachusetts), and the like. Moreover, aspects of the invention can be used in simulation, training, or video gaming applications. For example, the subject can utilize a glove as described herein to interact with a virtual environment, e.g. , by grasping and twisting a door knob, handling a weapon, holding a baseball, and the like.
