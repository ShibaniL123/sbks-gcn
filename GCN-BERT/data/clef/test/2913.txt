FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to an improved anti-wear additive composition that may be used in lubricating oils, such as, but not limited to, manual transmission fluids, automatic transmission fluids, continuously variable transmission fluids, hydraulic pumps, engine oils and gear oils; and a process for preparing the same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Most base oils which are used as lubricating oils, such as engine oils or automatic transmission fluids, require the addition of additives to improve the performance of the lubricating oil and/or to reduce the friction and wear of the moving parts of a vehicle that rub together. These additives are generally classified as ones that influence the physical and chemical properties of the base fluids or affect primarily the metal surfaces by modifying their physicochemical properties. One such additive is an anti-wear agent that is used to reduce wear of metal components. When General Motors Corporation (GM) upgraded its DEXRON速-III specification, several test procedures and limits were revised, including the wear limit. Previously the maximum weight loss accepted by GM was 15 mg. In the new specification, GM reduced this limit to 10 mg weight loss maximum. Not all anti-wear additive compositions provide suitable wear inhibition to meet the new GM specifications. Also some wear inhibitors may cause copper corrosion. BACKGROUND ART Rounds, Patent No. 3,053,341, discloses a lubricant additive and a method of lubricating a hydraulically controlled automatic transmission and a hypoid gear type differential. The lubricant is a relatively low viscosity base material, which is suitable for operation in an automatic transmission, which is mixed with an additive, such as dialkyl phosphite. These types of materials have been used as antiwear additives, but are corrosive towards copper and would not meet GM's specifications. Minami et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,792,733, discloses anti-wear lubricant additives that are used in a variety of lubricants that are based on diverse oils of lubricating viscosity, including natural and synthetic lubricating oils and mixtures thereof. The composition comprises an oil of lubricating viscosity, an anti-wear improving amount of at least one phosphorous compound, and a hydrocarbon of about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms having ethylenic unsaturation. Jaffe, U.S. Patent No. 4,342,709 discloses a process of producing diethyl phosphite. This process results in a high quality diethyl phosphite product having low acidity. Ryer et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,185,090 and U.S. Patent No. 5,242,612 disclose an anti-wear additive comprising a mixture of products formed by simultaneously reacting (1) a betahydroxy thioether, such as thiobisethanol and (2) a phosphorous-containing reactant, such as tributyl phosphite. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an anti-wear additive composition comprising: (a) dilauryl hydrogen phosphite;(b) trialkyl phosphite having the formula wherein R, R' and R" are independently alkyl groups having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms; and wherein the ratio of (a) to (b) is from 1.0:10.7 to 1.0:1.6. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a lubricating oil composition comprising: (a) dilauryl hydrogen phosphite;(b) trialkyl phosphite having the formula wherein R, R' and R" are independently alkyl groups having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms; and(c) an oil of lubricating viscosity; wherein the ratio of (a) to (b) is from 1.0:10.7 to 1.0:1.6, and wherein the lubricating oil composition comprises a total phosphorous weight percent from the combination of (a) and (b) of from 0.003 % to 0.300 % of the lubricating oil composition. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved anti-wear additive composition to be used in an oil of lubricating viscosity, which has the added advantage of low copper corrosion. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions The following terms used within the description are defined as such: The term "oil-soluble wear reducing phosphorous containing component (s)" refers to additives in lubricant compositions that contain phosphorous and which exhibit an anti-wear benefit, either alone or when used in combination with other additives that are present in lubricating oils, such as, but not limited to, manual transmission fluids, automatic transmission fluids, continuously variable transmission fluids, hydraulic pump fluids, engine oils and gear oils. The term "total phosphorous" refers to the total amount of phosphorous in the lubricant composition regardless of whether such phosphorous is present as part of an oil-soluble wear reducing phosphorous containing component or in the form of a contaminant in the lubricant composition such as residual phosphorous. The amount of phosphorous in the lubricating oil composition is independent of source. The term "DEXRON速-III" refers to a General Motors Corporation trademark for a specification for automatic transmission fluids primarily for use in GM automatic transmissions. It has been discovered that the present anti-wear additive composition which is a combination of at least one neutral phosphite compound with at least one acid phosphite compound, has a synergistic effect and yields a surprising wear reducing property of metal surfaces in relative motion found in transmissions, engines, pumps, gears and other such metal comprising materials; furthermore, this novel, non-obvious anti-wear additive composition meets new wear requirements for automatic transmission fluids pursuing DEXRON速-III, H Revision, (hereinafter DEXRON速-III) approval. The Additive Composition The anti-wear additive composition of the present invention contains two oil-soluble additive components. This anti-wear additive composition may be used in lubricating oils, such as but not limited to, manual transmissions fluids, automatic transmission fluids, continuously variable transmission fluids, hydraulic pumps, engine oils and gear oils. The additive composition of the present invention comprises trialkyl phosphite combined with dilauryl hydrogen phosphite in a weight ratio that drastically reduces removal of metal of two mating surfaces in relative motion. The neutral phosphite compounds may be selected from the group comprising hydrocarbyl phosphite compounds including but not limited to trihydrocarbyl phosphites. Dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, which is manufactured and sold by Rhodia, Inc., Cranbury, New Jersey, is marketed under the trade name Duraphos AP-230. In addition to being purchased from Rhodia, Inc., dilauryl hydrogen phosphite may be also be synthesized from well known processes such as that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,342,709. The trialkyl phosphite is represented by the following formula: wherein R, R', and R" are independently alkyl groups having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms. Most preferred trialkyl phosphites include trilauryl phosphite, which is manufactured and sold by Rhodia, Inc. and is marketed under the trade name Duraphos TLP. In addition to being purchased from Rhodia, Inc., trialkyl phosphite may be synthesized from well known processes such as that described in U.S. Patent No. 2,848,474. The Lubricating Oil Composition The wear reducing combination of the trialkyl phosphite and dilauryl hydrogen phosphite is generally added to a base oil, such as an oil of lubricating viscosity, that is sufficient to lubricate and reduce the wear of metal surfaces and other components which are present in axles, transmissions, hydraulic pumps, engines and the like. Typically, the lubricating oil composition of the present invention comprises a major amount of an oil of lubricating viscosity and a minor amount of the anti-wear additive composition, which is comprised of dilauryl hydrogen phosphite and the trialkyl phosphite. Specifically, in addition to the oil of lubricating viscosity, the lubricating oil composition contains an additive composition having (a) dilauryl hydrogen phosphite. The lubricating oil composition also contains (b) trialkyl phosphite, such as trilauryl phosphite, in the lubricating oil composition. The ratio of (a) to (b) in the lubricating oil composition is from 1.0:10.7 to 1.6:1.0. More preferred, the ratio of (a) to (b) in the lubricating oil composition is from 1.0:10.1 to 1.6:1.0. Even more preferred, the ratio of (a) to (b) in the lubricating oil composition is from 1.0:9.9 to 1.0:1.6. Most preferred, the ratio of (a) to (b) in the lubricating oil composition is from 1.0:9.1 to 1.0:3.0. The lubricating oil composition comprises a total phosphorous weight percent from the combination of the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite and the trialkyl phosphite of from 0.003% to 0.300% of the lubricating oil. composition. More preferred, the lubricating oil. composition comprises a total phosphorous weight percent from the combination of the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite and the trialkyl phosphite of from 0.006% to 0.250% of lubricating oil composition. Most preferred, the lubricating oil composition comprises a total phosphorous weight percent from the combination of the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite and the trialkyl phosphite of from 0.012% to 0.100% of lubricating oil composition. According to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), Duraphos TLP is comprised of approximately 90% trilauryl phosphite, 7.5% dialkyl hydrogen phosphite, 0.5% phenol and 2.0% impurities. The MSDS for Duraphos AP-230 discloses that this additive is comprised of approximately 92% dilauryl hydrogen phosphite and 8% impurities. Duraphos TLP has good antioxidant qualities and has a good effect on friction; however, when Duraphos TLP is used alone in a lubricating oil, it fails to meet the new GM wear specification. By contrast, Duraphos AP-230 (dilauryl hydrogen phosphite) is a known antiwear agent, as taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,053,341, but is also corrosive towards copper. It has been discovered that a certain ratio of dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, to trialkyl phosphite, such as trilauryl phosphite has a synergistic effect on the reduction of wear, while this mixture is almost non-corrosive towards copper. The examples which follow (see Comparative Example E herein) show that a neutral phosphite compound, such as a trilauryl phosphite (e.g., Duraphos TLP), used alone as a wear inhibitor does not reduce wear enough to meet the new GM ATF wear specification. Surprisingly, however, when a synergistic amount of trialkyl phosphite, such as Duraphos TLP, used in combination with dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, such as Duraphos AP-230, wear is reduced. The synergistic effect of the two components is achieved when the weight ratio of the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, to trialkyl phosphite, such as trilauryl phosphite is from 1.0:10.7 to 1.0:1.6. More preferred, the ratio of the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, to the trialkyl phosphite, such as trilauryl phosphite, is from 1.0:10.1 to 1.6:1.0. Even more preferred, the ratio of the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, to the trialkyl phosphite, such as trilauryl phosphite, is from 1.0:9.9 to 1.0:1.6. Most preferred, the ratio of the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, to the trialkyl phosphite, such as trilauryl phosphite, is from 1.0:9.1 to 1.0:3.0. The base oil employed may be any one of a variety of oils of lubricating viscosity. The base oil of lubricating viscosity used in such compositions may be mineral oils or synthetic oils. A base oil having a viscosity of at least 2.5 cSt at 40属C and a pour point below 20属C, preferably at or below 0属C, is desirable. The base oils may be derived from synthetic or natural sources. Mineral oils for use as the base oil in this invention include, but are not limited to, paraffinic, naphthenic and other oils that are ordinarily used in lubricating oil compositions. Synthetic oils include, but are not limited to, both hydrocarbon synthetic oils and synthetic esters and mixtures thereof having the desired viscosity. Hydrocarbon synthetic oils may include, but are not limited to, oils prepared from the polymerization of ethylene, polyalphaolefin or PAO oils, or oils prepared from hydrocarbon synthesis procedures using carbon monoxide and hydrogen gases such as in a Fisher-Tropsch process. Useful synthetic hydrocarbon oils include liquid polymers of alpha olefins having the proper viscosity. Especially useful are the hydrogenated liquid oligomers of C6 to C12 olefins such as 1-decene trimer. Likewise, alkyl benzenes of proper viscosity, such as didodecyl benzene, can be used. Useful synthetic esters include the esters of monocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic acids, as well as mono-hydroxy alkanols and polyols. Typical examples are didodecyl adipate, pentaerythritol tetracaproate, di-2-ethylhexyl adipate, dilaurylsebacate, and the like. Complex esters prepared from mixtures of mono and dicarboxylic acids and mono and dihydroxy alkanols can also be used. Blends of mineral oils with synthetic oils are also useful. Thus, the base oil can be a refined paraffin type base oil, a refined naphthenic base oil, or a synthetic hydrocarbon or non-hydrocarbon oil of lubricating viscosity. The base oil can also be a mixture of mineral and synthetic oils. The most preferred base oil is a Group II; Group III; a mixture of Group II and Group III; a mixture of Group II and synthetic oils; Group IV or mixtures thereof. Additionally, other additives well known in lubricating oil compositions may be added to the anti-wear additive composition of the present invention to complete a inished oil.

Method of Making Lubricating Oil Composition Other additives, including but not limited to, dispersants, detergents, oxidation inhibitors, seal swell agents, and foam inhibitors may be added to the anti-wear additive composition, described herein, effectively making an automatic transmission fluid (ATF) additive package. This ATF additive package may be added to an oil of lubricating viscosity forming a lubricating oil composition, which is also referred to as a finished lubricating oil composition. Preferably, this ATF additive package may be added in an amount which delivers from about 0.045 wt% to about 5.66 wt% of the anti-wear additive composition. More preferred, this ATF additive package may be added in an amount which delivers from about 0.09 wt% to about 4.72 wt% of the anti-wear additive composition. Most preferred, this ATF additive package may be added in an amount which delivers from about 0.18 wt% to about 1.89 wt% of the anti-wear additive composition. This lubricating oil composition is made by mixing the anti-wear additive composition, the remaining optional components of the ATF additive composition and an oil of lubricating viscosity in a stainless steel vessel at a temperature of from about 75 degrees F to about 180 degrees F from about 1 to about 6 hours. Optionally this anti-wear additive composition also can be used as a top treat to a finished lubricating oil composition. Furthermore, if the oil of lubricating viscosity already comprises either the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite or the trialkyl phosphite, then the other phosphite compound, either the dilauryl hydrogen phosphite or the trialkyl phosphite, that is absent from the finished oil may be added. The amount of the added dilauryl hydrogen phosphite compound or the trialkyl phosphite should not exceed 0.3 wt% total phosphorous in the finished oil. The amount of phosphorous present in the finished oil is from 0.003 wt % to 0.3 wt%. A preferred amount of phosphorous present in the finished oil is from 0.006 wt% to 0.25 wt%. A most preferred amount of phosphorous present in the finished oil is from 0.012 wt% to 0.1 wt%. Method of Use of the Present Invention The present invention is used to decrease the wear of the metal of at least two mating metal surfaces in relative motion. Specifically, the lubricating oil of the present invention contacts metal components in axles, pumps and transmissions to reduce wear and lubricates contiguous metal components thereby decreasing wear of the mating metal surfaces. The lubricating oil composition of the present invention typically contains from about 0.045 wt% to about 5.66 wt% of the anti-wear additive composition of the present invention. Preferably, the lubricating oil of the present invention contains from about 0.09 wt% to about 4.72 wt% of the anti-wear additive composition of the present invention. Most preferred, the lubricating oil of the present invention contains from about 0.18 wt% to about 1.89 wt% of the anti-wear additive composition of the present invention. The anti-wear additive composition will optionally contain sufficient inorganic liquid diluent to make it easy to handle during shipping and storage. Typically, the anti-wear additive composition will contain from about 1 % to about 40% of the organic liquid diluent and preferably from about 3 % to about 20 wt%. Suitable organic diluents which can be used include, for example, solvent refined 100N (i.e., Cit-con 100N which may be purchased from Citgo Petroleum Corporation, Houston, Texas), and hydrotreated 100N (i.e., Chevron 100N which may be purchased from ChevronTexaco Corporation, San Ramon, California), and the like. The organic diluent preferably has a viscosity of about 10 to 20 cSt at 100属C. Performance Testing The anti-wear additive composition of the present invention was tested for wear using a modified version of ASTM D-2882 Test Method, which was developed to measure the weight loss of metal as it relates to erosion caused by wear. The standard test for lubrication and pump wear properties is ASTM D-2882 which employs a similar method as described herein. The differences between the standard and the modified versions involve operating at different pressures (2,000 psi (13.8 MPa), standard, and 1,000 psi (6.89 MPa), modified) and the allowable maximum amount of weight loss to be considered an excellent anti-wear hydraulic fluid (twenty milligrams, standard, and ten milligrams, modified). In the modified test, the hydraulic fluid is circulated through a Vickers pump and a pressure relief valve at 1,000 psi (6.89 MPa) and 175属F (79属C) for 100 hours. The ring and vane components of the pump are weighed before and after the test to determine the total weight loss. Less weight loss indicates better lubrication and better wear inhibition. Using the DEXRON速-III automatic transmission fluid (ATF) specification, the maximum allowable weight loss is 10 mg. Typically, the anti-wear additive composition of the present invention meets the wear requirements of the DEXRON速-III automatic transmission fluid (ATF) specification using the modified ASTM D-2882 test. The DEXRON速-III specification (DEXRON速-III, H Revision, Automatic Transmission Fluid Specification, GMN10055) may be purchased from IHS Engineering, Inc. at http://www.global.ihs.com. http://www.global.ihs.com. In some cases, the anti-wear additive composition was also tested for its effects with regard to copper corrosion. It was evaluated according to the ASTM D-130 test procedure (121属C for 3 hours). The ASTM D-130 Test Method is the test that was developed to measure the stability of the lubricating oil in the presence of copper and copper alloys (i.e., extent of copper corrosion). In addition to the ASTM D-130 rating (copper corrosion is measured on a scale of 1 to 4, wherein a result of 1 represents slight tarnish and a result of 4 represents copper corrosion), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurement in the used oil was also conducted. The anti-wear additive composition of the present invention results in copper corrosion of less than 20 ppm of copper in the used oil as measured by ICP and in the ASTM D-130 test. Using solely dilauryl hydrogen phosphite as an anti-wear additive in a lubricating oil composition increases the amount of copper corrosion (see Comparative Example E). The following examples are presented to illustrate specific embodiments of this invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Base Blend Example An automatic transmission additive package was prepared by mixing the following components at about 195 degrees F for about two hours: 53.88 wt% 1000 MW monosuccinimide dispersant, 12.74 wt% 1300 MW bissuccinimide dispersant post-treated with boric acid, 0.28 wt% high overbased (HOB) calcium sulfonate, 3.82 wt% phenolic oxidation inhibitor, 6.37 wt% aminic oxidation inhibitor, 0.51 wt% triazole derivative, 6.37 wt% benzoate ester seal swell agent, 1.27 wt% foam inhibitor, 2.55 wt% polyamide of tetraethylpentaamine (TEPA) and isostearic acid (ISA), 7.20 wt% Duraphos TLP, and 5.01 wt% Group I 100 N diluent oil. Fifty five gallons of automatic transmission fluid (ATF) were prepared by blending 7.85 wt% of the above defined additive package, 2.50 wt% polyalkyl methacrylate (PMA) -dispersant viscosity index improver (the weighted-average molecular weight of the polymer is approximately 350,000), 79.63 wt% Group II 100 N base oil, and 10.02 wt% polyalphaolefin 4 cSt. These components were blended in a stainless steel vessel at a temperature of between about 125 degrees F (52属C) to about 140 degrees F (60属C). For about 2 hours. The finished, blended oil had a.viscosity of approximately 6.9 cSt at 100 C. The finished, blended oil contained about 0.565 wt% Duraphos TLP with a total phosphorous content of about 300 ppm. The ratio of dilauryl hydrogen phosphite to trilauryl phosphite in the finished oil was 1.0:12.0. Example 1 Four gallons of automatic transmission fluid blend from the Base Blend Example above were prepared by mixing in a stainless steel vessel 0.08 wt% Duraphos AP-230, a dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, 0.04 wt% of a thiadiazole derivative (Hitec 4313) to 99.88 wt% of the above described base blend. These components were blended at about 120 degrees F (49属C) for about 1 hour. This finished oil contained about 0.565 wt% of Duraphos TLP, which delivers about 0.04 wt% dilauryl hydrogen phosphite and about 0.509 wt% trilauryl phosphite, and about 0.08 wt% Duraphos AP-230, which delivers about 0.074 wt% dilauryl hydrogen phosphite, with a total phosphorous content of about 359 ppm in the finished oil. The ratio of dilauryl hydrogen phosphite to trilauryl phosphite in the finished oil was 1.0:4.2. The finished oil was evaluated for wear inhibition using the modified ASTM D2882 wear test.
