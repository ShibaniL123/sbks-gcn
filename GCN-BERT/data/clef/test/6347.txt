CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of priority U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/302,596 filed Feb. 9, 2010 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the preparation of an injectable paste from powdery calcium sulfate based bone cement compositions and a medicament, which compositions are made ready to use, by mixing with an aqueous liquid and further to the manufacture of antibiotic beads and the use thereof for treatment of osteomyelitis. Introduction The life expectancy of the world population has increased tremendously during the last 50 years, and according to the forecasts there will be more people over 60 years of age than less than twenty years of age in Europe. More people will need medical help for diseases related to age, which will increase the pressure of the hospitals. Bone is the second most common material to be transplanted after blood. The most reliable method to repair bone defects is to use autogenous bone, i.e. bone taken from another site in the body. However, problems may occur at the second surgical site from where the graft is taken. To avoid these extra trauma allograft can be used i.e. bone graft between individuals of the same species. Allograft has a lower osteogenic capacity than autograft and the rate of new bone formation might be lower. They also have a higher resorption rate, a larger immunogenic response and less revascularisation of the recipient. Allograft must also be controlled for viruses since they can transfer, for example, HIV and hepatitis. The use of allograft is now the most common method for bone transplantation and repairing of bone defects. To solve the problems of supply, unpredictable strength and risk of infection, synthetic bone substitutes have become a realistic alternative. Thus, the demand for and use of synthetic bone substitutes is increasing rapidly. Calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CaSO.½H2O, CSH, was one of the first materials investigated as a substitute for bone grafts. Calcium sulfate hemihydrate implanted in areas of subcortical bone produces no further untoward reaction in the tissue than normally is present in a fracture. The new bone growing into calcium sulfate is normal bone, and no side effects attributable to the implantation of calcium sulfate hemihydrate have been noted in adjacent tissues or in distant organs. The most important advantage with calcium sulfate is its excellent biocompatibility. The drawbacks are the rapid resorption and low strength, which makes it less useful in larger or non-contained defects and when the fracture healing exceeds 4-6 weeks. When calcium sulfate hemihydrate is mixed with water, it will hydrate to calcium sulfate dihydrate, CSD, according to the below reaction scheme (1): [in-line-formulae]CaSO4.0.5H2O+1.5H2O=>CaSO4.2H2O+Heat (1)[/in-line-formulae] The hydration reaction of calcium sulfate hemihydrate can be summarized in three phases. 1) The induction period starting immediately after the calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder is mixed with water. The calcium sulfate hemihydrate then dissolves and the solution becomes supersaturated with respect to calcium and sulfate ions. This leads to precipitation of the less soluble calcium sulfate dihydrate, CSD. In order for the hydration reaction to be able to proceed, these CSD nuclei have to have a radius that is larger than a “critical radius” (determined for each specific system). The induction period is critical for the hydration reaction and any disturbances in the solubility of calcium sulfate hemihydrate or growth of CSD-crystals in this phase will delay the further hydration reaction to a higher degree than occurrence of the same disturbance in later phase of the process.2) The acceleratory or growth period starts when a sufficient number of CSD crystals have reached the critical size for them to act as nucleating embryos. The CSD nucleus formed will then grow and form large crystals. The crystals will eventually be sufficiently large to interlock with each other and the friction between crystals contributes to the strength of the formed material.3) The third phase is relatively slow and consists of the completion of the hydration of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate as stated in N. B. Singh and B. Middendorf, Calcium sulphate hemihydrate hydration leading to gypsum crystallization, Progress in Crystal Growth and Characterization of Materials 53 (2007) 57-77 and as illustrated in FIG. 1 in the form of a schematic view showing the fraction of hydrated calcium sulfate dihydrate as a function of time. For a variety of applications, it is desired to be able to mix different additives to calcium sulfate based bone cements. Bone substitutes comprising an antibiotic content are often requested to prevent or treat osteomyelitis (bone infections) (Steven Gitelis and Gregory T. Brebach, The treatment of chronic osteomyelitis with a biodegradable antibiotic implant, Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery 2002 10(1): 53-60). Several non-biodegradable and biodegradable antibiotic cement delivery systems are available for the delivery of antibiotics for adjunctive therapy in the management of osteomyelitis. A major representative of the non-biodegradable delivery system includes the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads. Antibiotics that can be incorporated into this delivery system are however limited to the heat stable antibiotics such as vancomycin and the amino glycosides; tobramycin being the more popular. However, it has been found that addition of various additives such as bioactive agents, e.g. an antioxidant, a vitamin, a hormone, antibiotics a cytostatic, a bisphosphonate, a growth factor, or a protein or peptide or a bone marrow aspirate or demineralised bone, to bone cement compositions based on calcium sulfate hemihydrate often interferes with or even prevents the hardening process thereof. The retarding effect on the hardening has been found to be dependent of the identity of the additive and the specific bone mineral substitute composition. Thus it has been found (Steven Gitelis and Gregory T. Brebach, ibid) that addition of antibiotics may retard or accelerate the hydration of calcium sulfate hemihydrate into calcium sulfate dihydrate significantly, or even prevent completion of the hydration and consequently, the hydraulic cement may no longer be suitable for use in clinical applications since its properties are significantly changed by the addition of the antibiotic. The incomplete/slow CSH hydration affects different properties of the final material and excludes a number of applications for the material. 2. Description of the Related Art Various bone cement compositions comprising ceramics hardening in vivo upon contact with water or body fluids and comprising a medicament have been disclosed. WO 2004/078223 (Lidgren) discloses a bone mineral substitute material comprising a calcium phosphate component and hardened calcium sulphate and an additive such as an antioxidant, a vitamin, a hormone, an antibiotic, a cytostatic, a bisphosphonate, a growth factor, or a protein. The additive can be included in the particulate hardened calcium sulfate during its preparation or included in the sterile aqueous liquid of the composition, and in the experiments a slow release of iohexyl or gentamycin was found when the additive was included in the particulate hardened calcium sulfate during its preparation. In N. B. Singh and B. Middendorf, Calcium sulphate hemihydrate hydration leading to gypsum crystallization, Progress in Crystal Growth and Characterization of Materials 53 (2007) 57-77 it is disclosed that the presence of e.g. carboxylic acids retards the growth of gypsum crystals during hemihydrate hydration. Richelsoph et al, Elution Behavior of Daptomycin-loaded Calcium Sulfate Pellets, CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH, Number 461, pp 68-73, found that antibiotics often tend to disturb the setting of calcium sulphate hemihydrate and that when adding daptomycin the CSH did not harden, and incorporation of traditional accelerant techniques (addition of a small percentage of calcium sulphate dihydrate, addition of saline, increasing the temperature and decreasing the water content) all failed to improve the setting characteristics. Furthermore, Richelsoph found that when using potassium sulfate as accelerator a suitable pellet was produced and describes a two-step method in which calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder and a potassium sulfate solution were stirred vigorously for two minutes and allowed to rest for additionally one minute before daptomycin was added. The hydration of calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CSH, into calcium sulfate dihydrate, CSD, may be retarded or prevented from being completed. This may lead to the result that the hydraulic cement will no longer be suitable for use in clinical applications since its properties are significantly changed by addition of an antibiotic. The incomplete/slow CSH hydration affects different properties of the final material and excludes the use of such a material for a number of applications. Accelerated hydration has also been reported when adding antibiotics, which leads to similar limitations. WO 02/05861 discloses an injectable composition for a bone mineral substitute material, which comprises a dry powder mixed with an aqueous liquid, said powder comprising a first reaction component comprising a calcium sulphate hemihydrate with the capability of being hardened to calcium sulphate dihydrate when reacting with said aqueous liquid; a second reaction component, which comprises a calcium phosphate with the capability of being hardened to a calcium phosphate cement when reacting with said aqueous liquid; and at least one accelerator for the reaction of said first and/or second reaction component with said aqueous liquid. WO 02/05861 does not disclose any specific compositions comprising an additive having a retarding effect on the hardening of the inorganic bone mineral substitute composition when admixed together with an aqueous liquid or any measure to counteract such retardation of the hardening of the composition. U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,139 discloses a method of using a plaster of Paris as an orthopedic filling material prepared by mixing 15-80% by weight of calcium sulfate half-hydrate and 85-20% by weight of water, an aqueous solution, an aqueous dispersion, or an aqueous suspension; and stirring the resulting mixture into a paste having a viscosity in the range of 20 and 75 poises. The paste is injected into a cavity of a bone or a vertebra to be reinforced. U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,139 discloses addition of drugs or nutrients before the mixing or in the midst of the mixing such that they are mixed with the calcium sulfate half-hydrate and water, the aqueous solution, the aqueous dispersion or the aqueous suspension provided. Further it is stated that such drugs and nutrients added should not have adverse effect on the hardening of the paste. After mixing the resulting paste is rested for a period of time to have a desired viscosity. It is an object of the invention to provide an inorganic bone mineral substitute composition comprising an additive having a desired effect, said additive having a retarding or strong retarding effect on the hardening of the inorganic bone mineral substitute composition when admixed together with an aqueous liquid for hardening of the cement composition without sacrificing the rate of setting, the completion of the hydration of CSH into CSD or the properties of the final product (after 30 minutes) which is important for the clinical use thereof and of special importance in environments having a high blood flow to reduce the risk of leakage and risk of ingress in the blood vessels, which may cause an embolus. It is also an object of the invention to provide an inorganic bone mineral substitute composition comprising an additive having a desired effect, said additive having a retarding effect on the hardening of the inorganic bone mineral substitute composition without changing the composition of bone mineral substitute by adding further chemicals. It is a further object of the invention to provide an inorganic bone mineral substitute composition comprising an additive having a desired effect, said additive having, as a side effect, a retarding or strong effect on the hardening of the inorganic bone mineral substitute composition which may be applied shortly after mixing without delay which would else prolong the time needed for surgery and thus the occupancy of the operating room reducing the total capacity thereof and the potentially dangerous period under anaesthesia.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of ready-to-use injectable bone cement paste compositions by mixing a dry inorganic bone cement powder comprising a particulate calcium sulfate hemihydrate capable of hardening in vivo by hydration of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate forming calcium sulfate dihydrate, an aqueous liquid and an additive, said additive having a retarding effect on the hardening of the inorganic bone mineral substitute composition when admixed together with an aqueous liquid, said method comprising a) providing a bone cement powder comprising calcium sulfate hemihydrate, an accelerator for the hardening of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate by hydration, said accelerator being selected from the group consisting of saline and calcium sulfate dihydrate, and a powdered calcium phosphate componentb) mixing the bone cement powder with the aqueous liquid for a period of time,c) leaving the mixture for the time needed for allowing the hydration reaction of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate to dissolve at least partially and formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate crystallization nuclei, andd) admixing the additive by means of a short-duration mixing using a minimum of energy. The resulting material may be introduced to a supportive tissue in a human or non-human animal subject directly by injection and allowed to harden in vivo or it may shaped into a desired shape such as pellets, small beads, rods, or blocks and left for hardening ex vivo and then be introduced to the supportive tissue. In the alternative the resulting paste material may be manually moulded and introduced into the supportive tissue and shaped in place and then allowed to harden in vivo. Supportive tissue may be any part of the tissue supporting the body or functional parts thereof such as bone tissue. In the present context the expressions “harden” and hardened” are used to designate setting reaction taking place when hydraulic cements react with water. It has been found that the method used to mix calcium sulfate based bone substitutes with an additive is crucial for the properties of the materials. This is especially relevant when adding certain additives that retard the setting process. It has now surprisingly been found that the time of addition of the additive in the preparation of CSH-based bone cement has a significant effect on the setting process. It has now surprisingly been found that when pre-mixing a hydraulic cement powder comprising powdered CSH and CSD as an accelerator and a powdered calcium phosphate component with the aqueous liquid to be used for preparing the cement and allowing the hydration reaction of the CSH start before adding the additive, it is possible to shorten the setting times for the cement comprising the additive to the level observed in the absence of the additive and to obtain a complete hydration of CSH to CSD without having to substitute usually preferred accelerators and without having to mix under vigorous stirring which would require the use of separate mixing equipment in the sterile operating rooms. The delayed mixing technique permits the calcium sulfate hydration process to proceed and allow the formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate crystallization nuclei prior to addition of an agent which can potentially alter the setting behavior and prolong the setting time. The retarding effect of the added agent is reduced by letting the hydration process start and proceed and allow the calcium sulphate dihydrate crystals have time to form and to grow before addition of the agent. Most retarding agents act on the formation of the calcium sulfate dihydrate crystals, i.e. prevents the formation of these crystals. If time is given to the material to form these crystals before addition of the retarding agent it has been found that the retarding effect of the agent is decreased. Examples of retarding agents that could be desirable to add to such material for the application in human or animal bodies are: Vitamin E (an antioxidant which facilitates bone regeneration, bone marrow aspirate (contains osteogenic factors), demineralized bone matrix (contains bone morphogenic proteins), antibiotics (for preventing/treating infections) and cytostatics (for treatment of bone malignancy). In accordance with the present invention it is possible to avoid changing the composition of bone mineral substitute by adding further chemicals (which may have undesired adverse effects) in order to counteract a retarding effect of a specific desired additive, and furthermore, the bone mineral substitute may be applied immediately after mixing without delay. It is believed that allowing the calcium sulfate hemihydrate to dissolve at least partially will lead to formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate crystallization nuclei, which will ensure the proceeding of the hardening. The mixing may be carried out manually in a mixing tool which then also can serve as injection syringe. The time needed for the hydration reaction to start depends on the length of the induction period for the particular system and it easily determined for each system by the skilled in the art by routine experiments. An initial mixing time of 10 seconds to 5 minutes, preferably from about 20 seconds to 2 minutes, most preferred about 30 seconds has been found suitable when carrying out the present invention. After the mixing, the material is suitably left for at least 15 seconds, depending on the initial mixing, preferably >1 minute before addition of additive. These time windows also leave a sufficiently broad time span for the use of the resulting paste to absorb many unforeseen incidents or minor delays often occurring during surgery and does not cause unnecessary prolongation of the surgery. The calcium sulfate hemihydrate may be a or β-calcium sulfate hemihydrate, α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate being preferred, and suitably the powdered calcium sulfate hemihydrate has a particle size of less than 500 μm, preferable less than 100 μm and preferable 99% of the particles have a particle size less than 80 μm. The particle size of the powdered calcium sulfate dihydrate accelerator suitably is less than 500 μm, preferably less than 150 μm, and most preferable less than 100 μm. The particulate calcium sulfate dihydrate should be present in an amount between 0.1 and 10 wt %, preferably between 0.1 and 2 wt % of the calcium sulfate hemihydrate which is to react with the aqueous liquid The powdered calcium phosphate component may e.g. be amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM; Ca(H2PO4).2H2O), dicalcium phosphate dihydrate DCPD (brushite; CaHPO4.2H2O), octacalcium phosphate (Ca8(HPO4)2(PO4)4.5H2O), calcium deficient hydroxyl apatite (CDHA; Ca9(HPO4)(PO4)5(OH)), tricalcium phosphate (TCP; Ca3(PO4)2), and hydroxyl apatite (HA; Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. It is preferred that the powdered calcium phosphate component is hydroxyl apatite or tricalcium phosphate, preferably hydroxyl apatite or α-tricalcium phosphate having a particle size less than 100 μm. When the powdered calcium phosphate component is tricalcium phosphate it is suitable to add an accelerator known per se such as hardened particulate calcium phosphate or disodium hydrogen phosphate as an accelerator for the calcium phosphate component. The hardened calcium phosphate should have a particle size which is less than 100 μm, suitably less than 50 μm, and comprise between 0.1 and 10 wt %, preferably between 0.5 and 5 wt % of the calcium phosphate which is to react with an aqueous liquid. The reaction of calcium phosphate to a calcium phosphate cement can also be accelerated by addition of a phosphate salt, for example disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4), which may be added as dry particles or dissolved in the aqueous liquid. In this case, the accelerator should be present in the aqueous liquid at concentrations of 0.1-10 wt %, preferably 1-5 wt %. In order to confer an initial strength to an inorganic bone mineral substitute material the calcium sulphate hemihydrate should comprise 2-80 wt %, preferably 10-30 wt % of the dry powder to be mixed with an aqueous liquid, when a calcium phosphate to be hardened is used. Likewise, the calcium phosphate to be hardened to a calcium phosphate cement should comprise 20-98 wt %, preferably 70-90 wt % of the dry powder. When using hydroxyl apatite as the calcium phosphate component, the hydroxyl apatite suitably comprises from 30 to 50 wt % of the dry powder, preferably about 40 wt %, in which case the CSH+CSD will constitute from 50 to 70 wt % of the dry powder, preferably about 60 wt %. In the composition, the aqueous liquid should comprise between 0.1 and 2 ml, preferably between 0.2 and 0.7 ml per gram powder. An inorganic bone cement powder which may suitably be used in the method of the present invention is commercially available from BONE-SUPPORT AB, Lund, Sweden under the trade name CERAMENT™ BONE VOID FILLER. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the additive is in the form of a bioactive agent. An additive in the form of a bioactive agent may e.g. be an antioxidant, a vitamin, a hormone, an antibiotic, a cytostatic, a bisphosphonate, a growth factor, or a protein or peptide. The additive may also be a bone marrow aspirate or demineralised bone. Advantageously, the additive is a substance that induces, stimulates and/or accelerates bone formation, such as osteoinductive compounds and/or compounds reducing bone turn over. Suitable bone inducing substances, which stimulate and/or accelerate bone formation, are growth factors and hormones. Growth factors and derivatives thereof are preferred, which are locally acting. It is preferred to use growth factors, which are autologous and effective in connection with bone, tendon or cartilage. Such growth factors are for example transforming growth factor (TGF β3), bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2 or BMP-7), PTHrP, osteoprotegrin (OPG), Indian Hedgehog, RANKL, basic fibroblast, insulin-like growth factor (IgF-1 or IGF-2), platelet derived growth factors, and vascular growth factors. These endogenously produced growth factors may be used as an additive either as single entities or combined in a growth factor mixture in order to accelerate bone growth. Thus, it is preferred that an endogenously produced bioactive molecule is used as a substance that induces bone formation. Examples of other bone stimulating compounds are parathyorid hormones and derivatives thereof, estrogens, progesterones, androgens, testosterones, calcitonin, somatomedin, and oxytocin, preferably also autologous, but they can also be produced according to procedures known within the art. The enamel matrix proteins amelin-1, amelin-2 and ameloblastin can also be included as an additive. Such compounds may either be autologous or extracted from or produced by tissues or cells from other species, or synthetically produced or produced by other living cells or organisms. Likewise, the cholesterol-lowering compound statin can also be included in order to induce, stimulate and/or accelerate bone formation. Examples of suitable bone breakdown inhibitors are biphosphonates, osteocalcin, osteonectin and derivatives thereof, which can be included as an additive in the particulate calcium sulfate of the inventive composition and of the resulting substitute. The bioactive agent can also be an anti-infectious substance, i.e. a compound with a static or cidal effect against invading foreign living material. Such compounds include natural antibiotics as well as other semisynthetic and synthetic antibacterial or bacteriostatic compounds, which are acting against pathogenic and/or infectious microorganisms, e.g. staphylococci. Examples of antibiotics for bone infections are tetracycline-HCl, vancomycin, tobramycin, gentamycin, and cephalosporin. Cytostatic agents, such as cis-platinum, ifosfamide, methotrexate, doxorubicin-HCl, arsenic trioxide, and retinoids or derivatives thereof can also be used as a bioactive agent. The bioactive agent can in a similar way be an antiviral compound, an antifungal compound, a tuberculostatic or tuberculocidal compound or an antiparasite compound. In a preferred embodiment the bioactive agent is an antibiotic agent. In the method of the invention further additives known per se for controlling the rheological properties, e.g. biocompatible oils as described in applicant's WO 01/76649, may also be added in a concentration of more than 1 wt % but less than 10 wt % of the total weight of the composition in order to improve the rheology of the same. Preferably, the concentration of oil should be between 2 and 6 wt % of the total weight of the composition, and such addition is also considered an aspect of the present invention. It is also considered an aspect of the present invention to add an X-ray contrast agent known per se, preferably a non-ionic water soluble contrast agent such as iohexyl as described in applicant's WO 03/053488.

Description of the Preferred Embodiments The invention is now explained more in detail with reference to below Examples and the drawings explaining preferred embodiments of the invention. Materials and Methods The ceramic bone substitute specimen contained 18.5 grams powder consisting of 59.6 wt % α-CSH, 0.4% CSD and 40 wt % hydroxyl apatite. Vancomycin Hydrochloride from NordMedica Iohexyl solution comprising 180 mg l/ml was used. Gillmore needles were used for characterization of setting time according to ASTM C266-04. The initial needle had a diameter of 2.12±0.05 mm and a weight of 113±0.5 g. The final needle had a diameter of 1.06±0.05 mm and a weight of 453.6±0.5 g. After mixing the paste was transferred into three moulds to form the test specimens. The initial and final setting time was taken as a mean value of the three tests. The initial setting time (IST) is the time from the moment liquid is added to the bone substitute powder until the initial needle leaves no mark on the surface of the specimen. The initial setting time shall be sufficiently long to enable injection of the bone cement paste into a void or to mould and manually apply a mouldable paste into a void. A suitable initial setting time is about 5-20 minutes. The final setting time is the time required for the paste to set so much that the final needle leaves no mark on the surface. The final setting time should preferably not exceed about 45 minutes in order to avoid inadvertent later moulding or ensuing dislocation of the paste which might cause damages on e.g. nerves or blood vessels. Qualitative and Quantitative phase analysis was performed using the Rietveld Method using a STOE θ/θ Diffractometer (X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Injection test was performed using a 10 ml syringe with a 16 gauge needle by extruding out an approximately 5-10 cm string manually as shown in FIG. 3 each minute until the time where no bone cement could be extruded. Example 1 and Reference Examples 1 and 2 Preparation of a ceramic bone substitute paste from 18.5 grams powder and 8 ml iohexyl solution and 1 gram Vancomycin Hydrochloride from NordMedica (5.4 wt % vancomycin of powder weight). In Examples 1 and reference Example 1 two groups of materials having the same composition, i.e. 1 gram vancomycin, 18.5 grams specimen of ceramic bone substitute powder and 8 ml iohexyl solution, were prepared, and the only difference between Example 1 and reference Example 1 was the method of mixing the materials. In reference Example 2 a corresponding material without vancomycin was prepared. This material corresponds to a state of the art cement paste without antibiotic. Reference Example 1 Preparation of a Ceramic Bone Substitute Paste 1 gram vancomycin powder was first dissolved in 8 ml iohexyl solution and then the resulting antibiotic-containing liquid was mixed with 18.5 grams powder for 30 s using a mixer of the kind disclosed in WO 2005/122971. The paste was used to prepare samples for characterization according to ASTM C266-04 and for XRD measurements. Example 1 Preparation of a Ceramic Bone Substitute Paste According to the Invention (Delayed Addition) 18.5 grams ceramic bone substitute powder and 8 ml iohexyl solution were first mixed for 30 s using the mixer stated above in the absence of the vancomycin and thereafter transferred to a bowl. At 5 min 1 gram Vancomycin powder without lumps was added to the bowl and thereafter mixed manually with the pre-mixed paste with minimal extra energy using a spatula. The paste was immediately used to prepare samples for setting characterization according to ASTM C266-04 and for XRD measurements. Injection test was performed. Reference Example 2 Preparation of a Ceramic Bone Substitute Paste without Vancomycin 18.5 grams powder and 8 ml iohexyl solution were mixed for 30 s using the above mixer. The paste was used to prepare samples for setting characterization according to ASTM C266-04 and for XRD measurements. Injection test was performed. Results The results are summarized in the below Table 1. The setting time measurements showed that the vancomycin-containing pastes prepared by dissolution of the Vancomycin powder in the liquid prior to the mixing with the hydraulic cement powder in reference Example 1 did not reach the initial setting time within the first 4.5 hours. The material finally became hard, but this is assumed to be due to drying. In contrast to this, the vancomycin-containing paste prepared according to Example 1 gave much shorter setting times. By using this method, the initial setting time occurred in about 12 minutes and the final setting time in about 17 minutes. These setting times were quite similar to the ones obtained for the sample without vancomycin prepared according to Reference Example 2 (intial setting time about 8 minutes and final setting time at about 15 minutes).

The figures stated are the weight percentage of the CSD of the total amount of calcium sulfate The XRD results stated in table 1 and FIG. 2 shows that the CSH in the sample prepared in reference Example 1 was only hydrated to about ⅔. This supports the assumption that the hardening of the cement in this case is partly due to simple drying of the mix and not completely due to setting. For the reference sample of Reference Example 2 and the sample prepared in Example 1, the XRD results showed that an almost complete CSH conversion to CSD. Discussion The results obtained using the method according to the invention indicates that it is generally applicable for the admixing of a wide range of different additives such as bioactive agents to calcium sulfate based compositions in which a hardening of calcium sulfate hemihydrate to calcium sulfate dihydrate is to take place. Although it is possible to promote the dissolution of CSH and speed up the setting process, for example by adding further accelerators such as NaCl it is, however, in many applications, important not to change the chemical composition of the material and hence, addition of other chemicals should thus be avoided. The present invention shows a drastic effect on the final properties of the material is obtained. It was found that an important factor for affecting the setting times in the method of the invention is the mixing of the cement with the additive. It was found that it is important that this mixing is a short-duration mixing using a minimum of energy. The more energy that is used, the less viscous will the paste be and the advantage of using the method of the invention may be lost. A slow gentle manual mixing using a broad spatula has been found to be suitable for the purpose of the present invention and constitutes a presently preferred embodiment. When the bone cement paste is to be injected directly into a void it is very important to be able to control how the antibiotic addition is affecting the hardening properties of the paste. This is especially pertinent in environments having a high blood flow as a very slow setting of the paste will increase the risk for leakage of the material. By using the method of the invention it was possible to shorten the setting times from >4.5 h down to approximately 12 min (IST: 12.1±2.7 min) when adding vancomycin to a bone cement paste. The method also gave a complete hydration of CSH to CSD. Example 3 In an analogous manner as described in Reference Example 1 pastes comprising calcium sulfate hemihydrate and calcium sulfate dihydrate as accelerator for the hardening thereof as well as hydroxyl apatite and iohexyl and further comprising bone morphogenic protein or various antibiotics were prepared. The pastes were used to prepare samples for setting characterization according to ASTM C266-04. The results of the determination of the effect of delayed addition on the initial setting time (IST) are summarized in the below Table 2 together with results obtained from samples prepared using initial addition. The results are mean values of three determinations.

Example 4 Manufacture of Antibiotic Beads Based on of Cerament™ Bone Void Filler Impregnated with Vancomycin A 10 ml Cerament™ Bone Void Filler kit was mixed with 2 grams of vancomycin utilizing the following 1-2-3-4 technique. First, the iohexyl solution was mixed with the Cerament™ Bone Void Filler with rotation of the wrist for two minutes. (FIG. 4A) At two minutes the Cerament™ Bone Void Filler was placed in a sterile bowl. (FIG. 4B) At three minutes, two grams of Vancomycin was added and mixed with a wide spatula in a rolling fashion. (FIG. 4C) By four minutes the placement of the mixture in the bead mold was completed. (FIG. 4D) At 15-20 minutes the antibiotic beads were removed from the mold and were ready for implantation. (FIG. 4E). Example 5 Use of Antibiotic Beads Based on of Cerament™ Bone Void Filler Impregnated with Vancomycin for the Treatment of Osteomyelitis In a clinical test a 42-year-old, non-smoking diabetic male presented with chronic foot ulcers and underlying 4th metatarsal osteomyelitis and 4th/5th toe gangrene was treated. The MRSA osteomyelitis involved the fourth metatarsal and forth toe proximal phalanx. The osteomyelitis was unresponsive to both to oral and intravenous antibiotics. The gangrene had started the day before surgery. The patient's past medical history was significant for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease with history of myocardial infarction and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient had a previous partial fifth metatarsal resection one year ago for osteomyelitis with no fourth toe, fifth toe, or fourth metatarsal involvement at that time. Lower extremity arterial non-invasive vascular studies demonstrated no significant stenotic disease. Surgical intervention was planned. Surgical management included ulcer debridement, amputation of the 4/5 th toes, and partial resection of the forth metatarsal. The Cerament™ Bone Void Filler beads were place in apposition to the remaining fourth metatarsal. Typical closure followed. The patient progressed very well. Bone cultures demonstrated MRSA. No systemic antibiotics were given after bone resection, Bactrim DS was given orally for two weeks after the partial bone resection. The Cerament™ Bone Void Filler—vancomycin impregnated beads started to show signs of reabsorbing at fourteen days after surgery and were completely resorbed at four weeks. The diabetic ulcers were healed at eleven weeks after surgery and there were no formed beads remaining. There was HA remaining that elicited no foreign body or immune host response. This patient had no recurrence of the osteomyelitis at six months post-op. DISCUSSION Cerament™ Bone Void Filler calcium sulfate and hydroxyl apatite antibiotic beads can be an effective, safe, and easy therapy in conjunction with surgical debridement for the management of osteomyelitis. A diabetic foot with MRSA osteomyelitis with successful management with surgical debridement and vancomycin Cerament™ antibiotic beads was treated. There was no local adverse reaction to the antibiotic beads and there was no osteomyelitis reoccurrence. An advantage of the Cerament™ Bone Void Filler calcium sulfate and hydroxyl apatite antibiotic beads is that because they are biodegradable, a subsequent second surgery to remove the beads is not necessary.
