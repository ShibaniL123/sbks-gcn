FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to an asphalt composition and a process for the manufacture of an asphalt composition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the road construction and road paving industry, it is a well-practised procedure to coat aggregate material such as sand, gravel, crushed stone or mixtures thereof with hot fluid bitumen, spread the coated material as a uniform layer on a road bed or previously built road while it is still hot, and compact the uniform layer by rolling with heavy rollers to form a smooth surfaced road. The combination of bitumen with aggregate material, such as sand, gravel, crushed stone or mixtures thereof, is referred to as “asphalt”. Bitumen, also referred to as “asphalt binder”, is usually a liquid binder comprising asphaltenes, resins and solvents. Bitumen can for example comprise pyrogenous mixtures derived from petroleum residues such as residual oils, tar or pitch or mixtures thereof. It is known in the art that sulphur can be mixed with bitumen for applications in the road construction and road paving industry. Sulphur-modified bitumen is formulated by replacing some of the bitumen in conventional binders by elemental sulphur. A problem that may be encountered during the production and paving of sulphur-containing asphalt is eye and throat irritation. The present inventors have sought to reduce worker eye and throat irritation during the production and paving of sulphur-containing asphalt. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have found that eye and throat irritation can be caused by the presence of sulphur vapour. During the sulphur-asphalt mix preparation process and while paving the road the prevailing temperature may be high enough to lead to amounts of sulphur vapour that can cause eye and throat irritation to nearby workers. At the elevated temperatures the vapour pressure of sulphur is sufficiently high to result in the presence of high amounts of sulphur vapour. The sulphur vapour that is in equilibrium above the hot asphalt mix will undergo deposition when in contact with a suitable surface. The present inventors have found that by incorporating a particular resin-based binder into the sulphur-containing asphalt it is possible to reduce the quantity of sulphur vapour and thereby decrease the amount of eye and throat irritation experienced by workers. Accordingly, the present invention provides an asphalt composition comprising aggregate, bitumen, sulphur and resin-based binder, wherein the resin-based binder comprises a thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin and diluent. In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for manufacturing an asphalt composition according to the present invention, the process comprising the steps of: (i) heating bitumen; (ii) heating aggregate; (iii) mixing the hot bitumen with the hot aggregate in a mixing unit to form an asphalt composition; wherein sulphur is added in at least one of steps (i), (ii) or (iii); and wherein a resin-based binder is added in at least one of the steps (i), (ii) or (iii), wherein said resin-based binder comprises a thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin and diluent. The invention further provides a process for preparing an asphalt pavement, wherein asphalt is prepared by a process according to the invention, and further comprising steps of: (iv) spreading the asphalt into a layer; and (v) compacting the layer. In an embodiment of the invention, the sulphur and the resin composition are added together; the sulphur is in the form of pellets and the resin-based binder is incorporated in the sulphur pellets. Accordingly the invention further provides sulphur pellets comprising resin-based binder in an amount from 2 wt % to 10 wt %, based upon the weight of the sulphur, wherein the resin-based binder comprises a thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin particles and a diluent. These pellets are advantageously used in a process according to the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The asphalt composition according to the invention comprises aggregate, bitumen, sulphur and a resin-based binder, wherein the resin-based binder comprises a thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin and a diluent. The aggregate is suitably any aggregate that is suitable for road applications. The aggregate may comprise coarse aggregate (retained on a 4 mm sieve), fine aggregate (passes a 4 mm sieve but is retained on a 63 μm sieve) and/or filler (passes a 63 μm sieve). Typically, the asphalt composition comprises at least 1 wt % of bitumen, based on the weight of the asphalt composition. An asphalt composition comprising from about 1 wt % to about 10 wt % of bitumen is preferred, with a special preference for asphalt compositions comprising from about 3 wt % to about 7 wt % of bitumen, based on the weight of the asphalt composition. The bitumen can be selected from a wide range of bituminous compounds. The bitumen that can be employed may be straight run bitumen, thermally cracked residue or precipitation bitumen, e.g. from propane. Although not necessary, the bitumen may also have been subjected to blowing. The blowing may be carried out by treating the bitumen with an oxygen-containing gas, such as air, oxygen-enriched air, pure oxygen or any other gas that comprises molecular oxygen and an inert gas, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen. The blowing operation may be conducted at temperatures of 175 to 400° C., preferably from 200 to 350° C. Alternatively, the blowing treatment may be conducted by means of a catalytic process. The bitumen for use herein is preferably a paving grade bitumen suitable for road application having a penetration of, for example, from 9 to 1000 dmm, more preferably of from 15 to 450 dmm (tested at 25° C. according to EN 1426: 1999) and a softening point of from 25 to 100° C., more preferably of from 25 to 60° C. (tested according to EN 1427: 1999). The amount of sulphur in the asphalt composition is preferably from 10 to 200 wt %, based upon the weight of the bitumen, preferably from 20 wt %, more preferably from 30 wt % and preferably to 100 wt %, more preferably to 80 wt %. The presence of sulphur in the asphalt paving mixture can improve the strength and rutting resistance of the paving mixture and it is important to include sufficient sulphur to realise these advantages. Additionally, incorporating increased amounts of sulphur can decrease the cost of the paving mixture. However, too much sulphur can decrease the workability of the paving mixture. The sulphur may be incorporated into the asphalt composition in the form of sulphur pellets. Reference herein to pellets is to any type of sulphur material that has been cast from the molten state into some kind of regularly sized particle, for example flakes, slates or sphere-shaped sulphur such as prills, granules, nuggets and pastilles or half pea sized sulphur. The sulphur pellets typically comprise from 50 to 100 wt % of sulphur, based upon the weight of the sulphur pellets, preferably from 60 wt % and most preferably from 70 wt %; and typically to 99 wt %, and preferably to 95 wt % or to 100 wt %. A more preferred range is from 60 to 100 wt %. These sulphur pellets may contain carbon black and, optionally, other ingredients, such as amyl acetate and wax. Carbon black may be present in amounts up to 5% wt, based on the pellet, preferably up to 2% wt. Suitably, the content of carbon black in the sulphur pellet is at least 0.25% wt. The content of other ingredients, such as amyl acetate and wax, typically does not exceed an amount of 1.0% wt each. When wax is present, it may be in the form of, for example, slack wax or wax derived from a Fischer-Tropsch process. Examples of suitable waxes for use herein are Sasobit®, a Fischer-Tropsch derived wax commercially available from Sasol, and SX100 wax, a Fischer-Tropsch wax from Shell Malaysia. An example of a suitable sulphur pellet for use herein is Thiopave® pellets commercially available from Shell Canada. The asphalt composition of the present invention comprises a resin-based binder comprising a thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin and a diluent. The resin-based binder is present in the asphalt composition at a level in the range of from 1 wt % to 10 wt %, based upon the weight of the sulphur. Preferably the resin-based binder is present at a level in the range of from 1 to 8 wt %, more preferably in the range of from 1.5 to 7 wt %, and most preferably in the range of from 2 to 6.5 wt %, with respect to the weight of the sulphur. Sufficient resin-based binder should be incorporated to achieve the desired reduction in sulphur vapour and eye and throat irritation, but larger quantities will incur greater expense. In principle, any thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin can be used in the process of the present invention. Suitable resins have been described in UK patent specification 1,226,234 and in European patent specification 179510. Further suitable resins will be known to the person skilled in the art. Preferably, the thermoplastic resin for use in the present invention is a polymer obtainable from cracked petroleum fractions typically having a boiling range from 140 to 200° C. at atmospheric pressure. Specifically preferred thermoplastic resins for use in the present invention, are aromatic resins obtainable from unsaturated compounds containing from 8 to 10 carbon atoms. More specifically, the compositions from which the resins are obtainable will be mixtures of dicyclopentadiene, vinyltoluene, indene, methylindene, methylstyrene and styrene. Traces of alkenyl aromatic compounds containing a larger number of carbon atoms, will generally also be present. The relative proportions of the monomers present, can differ. Catalysts most often used in the manufacture of these resins, are aluminium chloride and boron trifluoride. The above resins are generally called C9 aromatic petroleum resins. Softening points of aromatic resins obtainable from unsaturated compounds containing from 8 to 10 carbon atoms, usually range from 50 to 180° C. Preferably, resin for use in the present invention has a softening point from 100 to 170° C., more preferably from 110 to 160° C. The above thermoplastic hydrocarbon resins are widely available commercially. Suitable C9 aromatic petroleum resins for use in the present invention can be obtained from Nevcin Polymers B.V. in Uithoorn, the Netherlands. A preferred resin for use in the present invention, is a thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin containing carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid anhydride and/or hydroxyl groups. Such resin can be obtained by treating a thermoplastic resin, more specifically a preferred resin as described above, with unsaturated carboxylic acid and/or anhydride such as maleic acid and/or anhydride, or by mild oxidation. Such resins can also be prepared by modification of the manufacturing process of the resin, such as by polymerisation of the monomers in the presence of unsaturated carboxylic acids or anhydrides or in the presence of hydroxyl group containing unsaturated compounds. Preferably, the polymerisation of the monomers is carried out in the presence of maleic acid, maleic acid anhydride and/or hydroxyethylmethacrylate. Thus modified resins preferably have acid values of from 1 to 100 mg KOH/g resin, more specifically from 2 to 50 mg KOH/g resin. Preferably, the mixing is carried out during a relatively short time. If mixing is carried out during a time which is much longer that the mixing time recommended by the mixer manufacturer, the composition obtained tends to have bad workability. This phenomenon is well known to the person skilled in the art. Generally, the total mixing time should be less than 10 minutes, preferably at most 5 minutes, most preferably at most 4 minutes. The total mixing time starts when all components have been added. The thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin will generally have a softening point, measured according to ASTM D 36, of at least 60° C., more specifically at least 80° C., more specifically at least 100° C. The softening point is preferably at most 250° C., more preferably at most 200° C., more preferably at most 170° C. The present invention involves the use of thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin particles. The resin must be present in the form of particles. Particles have a relatively high specific surface area which ensures sufficient heat transport when mixing the resin particles with aggregate. The resin particles make sure that the composition obtained is homogeneous while the mixing time can be relatively short. The latter gives a composition of good workability. Specific suitable particles are particles having on weight average a volume of less than 10−3 m3, preferably less than 10−4 m3, more preferably less than 10−5 m3, more preferably less than 10−6 m3. Preferred resin particles have a surface area of at least 200 m2/m3. More preferably, the resin particles have a surface area of at least 300 m2/m3, more preferably at least 500 m2/m3, more preferably at least 700 m2/m3, most preferably at least 1000 m2/m3. The volume is taken to be the volume of resin, excluding voids. It is advantageous to use in the present process resin particles having a very high surface area and very small size. There is no upper limit to the surface area and no lower limit to the size of the resin particles which can be used. Resin particles having the preferred volume and/or surface area can be prepared in any suitable way known to the person skilled in the art. A convenient method comprises extrusion of the resin, followed by cutting the extruded strands into particles of the desired size. Another method involves forming relatively thin solid resin sheets, which are subsequently crushed to obtain particles of the desired size. The resin particles for use in the present invention, can contain diluent. Independently from whether the resin particles contain diluent, the process of the present invention comprises adding diluent to the mix in addition to adding resin particles optionally containing diluent. The diluent and/or resin particles preferably have a temperature of less than 60° C. before being added to the mix, more preferably less than 40° C. Most preferably, the diluent and/or resin particles have ambient temperature. Most preferably, at least the resin particles have such relatively low temperature. The diluent for use in the present invention, can be any compound known to be suitable to the person skilled in the art. Generally, the diluent will have a softening point of less than 50° C., preferably less than 30° C. Generally, the diluent will be fluid or viscous at 25° C. The kind of diluent used will depend on the resin used, and on the properties desired for the final road surface. Usually, the combination of diluent and resin should be such that the composition obtained is stable. The composition is stable if it does not separate into its components at the temperature at which it is mixed or at which it is transported. The aromaticity of the resin and diluent are important for the stability of the composition. Usually, paraffinic diluents are used in combination with paraffinic resins, while aromatic diluents are used in combination with aromatic resins. The weight ratio of diluent to resin depends on the softening point of the resin and on the viscosity of the diluent and on the desired penetration value of the binder in the final product. Generally, the final product will contain a weight ratio of thermoplastic resin to diluent in the range from 20:80 to 80:20, more specifically in the range from 30:70 to 70:30. A well known aromatic diluent which is often used in combination with aromatic thermoplastic hydrocarbon resins, is an extract obtained by solvent extraction of a mineral lubricating oil. Extraction of lubricating oil with the help of a solvent such as furfural, is well known to the person skilled in the art. The lubricating oil subjected to extraction preferably is a bright stock lubricant, which is prepared by propane deasphalting of paraffinic short residue. Generally, the thermoplastic resin particles used herein have a relatively high softening point and the resin particles contain diluent having a softening point which is lower than the softening point of the resin. Preferably, the thermoplastic resin particles contain from 5 to 60% wt of diluent, based on amount of thermoplastic resin. More preferably, the resin particles contain from 10 to 50% wt of diluent. In order to change the properties of the composition containing resin, diluent and aggregate, further polymer can be present in either the resin particles or the diluent. Polymer which can be present comprises elastomers, amorphous polyolefins, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers and polymers containing available epoxy groups, e.g. as described in patent specification WO 96/28513. Preferred polymers are polymers such as VESTOPLAST amorphous poly-alpha-olefin commercially available from Creanova (VESTOPLAST is a trade mark), EVATANE ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer commercially available from Elf Atochem (EVATANE is a trade mark), ELVALOY polymer commercially available from Du Pont (ELVALOY is a trade mark) and KRATON elastomer commercially available from Kraton Polymers (KRATON is a trade mark). If further polymer is present in the resin particles, the amount of further polymer in the particles is generally at most 20% by weight of further polymer, based on amount of thermoplastic hydrocarbon resin. If the further polymer is present in the diluent to be added to the mix, the amount of further polymer is generally at most 25% by weight of polymer, based on amount of diluent which is added to the mix separately from the resin particles. A preferred resin-based binder for use herein is Mexphalte CLT commercially available from Shell Bitumen. The asphalt composition of the invention may suitably comprise additional components. In one embodiment of the invention the asphalt composition comprises an anionic surfactant in an amount of from 0.05% to 10%, based on the weight of sulphur. The anionic surfactant is suitably chosen from the group consisting of lignin derivatives such as lignosulphonates; aromatic sulphonates and aliphatic sulphonates and their formaldehyde condensates and derivatives; fatty acids and carboxylates, including sulphonated fatty acids; and phosphate esters of alkylphenol-, polyalkylaryl- or alkyl-alkoxylates. The asphalt composition of the invention may suitably comprise further additional components. In one embodiment of the invention, the asphalt composition comprises a surfactant selected from a cationic surfactant, an amphoteric surfactant, and mixtures thereof. As used herein, the terms ‘cationic surfactant’ and ‘amphoteric surfactant’ refer to compounds present in their cationic or amphoteric form as well as those that will be converted into their cationic or amphoteric form (e.g. by protonation or alkylation) in situ. Suitable cationic surfactants include, but are not limited to, nitrogen-containing cationic surfactants. Nitrogen-containing cationic surfactants will generally be selected from the group of aliphatic nitriles (RCN), aliphatic amides (RCONH2), aliphatic amines (e.g. RNH2, RRNH, R(CH3)2N, R(CH3) RR(CH3)N), R3N), aliphatic polyamines ((RNHR′), NH2), beta primary aliphatic amines (e.g. RCH(NH2)CH3), beta aliphatic polyamines, aryl aliphatic amines (e.g. R(C6H5)NH2 include the benzyl derivatives e.g. RN(CH3)2CH2C6H5), etheramines (e.g. ROR′NH2) or non-aromatic cyclic amines (e.g. alkylimidazolines and alkyl morpholines), or derivatives of any of the compounds listed above, such as their salts, ethylene or propylene oxide adducts or quaternary ammonium salts. Especially preferred cationic surfactants are fatty amine alkoxylates represented by the general formula R1NR2R3, wherein R1 is an aliphatic moiety containing from 12 to 20 carbon atoms and R2 and R3 are each independently aliphatic moieties containing from 2 to 25 ethoxy/propoxy units. Preferably R2 and R3 are identical. Suitable amphoteric surfactants include, but are not limited to, nitrogen-containing amphoteric surfactants.

As used herein, R represents substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic radicals of from 8 to 22, preferably 12 to 20, more preferably 16 to 20, carbon atoms, R′ represents an alkyl radical of from 2 to 4 carbon atoms and n represents an integer of from 1 to 3. Preferably, the at least one surfactant is selected from aliphatic amines (e.g. RNH2, RRNH, R(CH3)2N, R(CH3)3N+, RR(CH3)N, R3N) and their ethylene or propylene oxide adducts. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the at least one surfactant is a ethylene or propylene oxide adduct of an aliphatic amine, wherein R is an aliphatic radical containing in the range of from 12 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably from 16 to 20 carbon atoms. In this embodiment the ethylene or propylene oxide adduct of an aliphatic amine is more preferably the ethylene or propylene oxide adduct of a tallow amine. A particularly preferred surfactant for use herein is that commercially available under the tradename Toximul TA5 (a cationic surfactant based on tallow amine ethoxylate), available from Stepan Company (Northfield, Ill., USA). Suitably, the total amount of surfactant present in the composition herein is in the range of from 0.05 wt % to 10 wt %, based upon the weight of the sulphur. Preferably the total amount of surfactant is in the range of from 0.1 to 8 wt %, more preferably in the range of from 0.2 to 6 wt %, and most preferably in the range of from 1 to 5 wt %, with respect to the weight of the sulphur. The asphalt composition of the invention may suitably comprise further additional components. In one embodiment of the invention the asphalt composition comprises a polymer. A preferred type of polymer is a copolymer comprising one or more vinyl aromatic compounds and one or more conjugated dienes, in an amount of 0.1 to 7% wt, based upon the weight of the asphalt composition. More preferably the polymer is a linear styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer of formula ABA wherein A is a polystyrene block and B is a polybutadiene block. Another preferred type of polymer is a copolymer formed from monomers including ethylene and glycidyl methacrylate or glycidyl acrylate, in an amount of 0.1 to 7% wt, based upon the weight of the asphalt composition. More preferably the polymer is a terpolymer formed from ethylene, alkyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate or glycidyl acrylate. The asphalt composition may comprise an aminic compound selected from carbamides, thiocarbamides, carbamates and thiocarbamates, and mixtures thereof. The asphalt composition preferably comprises from 0.01 wt % to 10 wt % of the aminic compound. Preferred aminic compounds include urea, N,N′-(bishydroxymethyl)urea, N,N′-dimethyl urea, N,N′trimethyl urea, 1,1-dimethyl urea, 1,3-diethyl urea, 1,3-dimethyl-1,3-diphenyl urea, benzyl urea, tert-butyl urea, phenyl urea, 1,3-diphenyl urea, 1,3-carbonyl dipiperidine, 1,3-dipropyl urea, 1,3-dibutyl urea, 1-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]urea, methyl carbamate, ethyl carbamate (also known as urethane), tert-butyl carbamate, phenyl carbamate and propyl carbamate. In step (i) of the processes for manufacturing the present asphalt compositions the bitumen is heated, preferably at a temperature of from 60° C. to 200° C., preferably from 80 to 150° C., more preferably from 100° C. to 145° C., and even more preferably from 125° C. to 140° C. Working above 120° C. has the advantage that sulphur is liquid which facilitates the mixing process. Although the skilled person can easily determine the optimal mixing time the mixing time may be relatively short, e.g., from 10 to 600 seconds. In step (ii) of the process for manufacturing the present asphalt composition the aggregate is heated, preferably at a temperature of from 60 to 200° C., preferably from 80 to 170° C., more preferably from 100 to 160° C., even more preferably from 100 to 145° C. In step (iii) of the asphalt manufacturing process, the hot bitumen from step (i) and hot aggregate from step (ii) are mixed in a mixing unit. Suitably, the mixing takes place at a temperature of from 80 to 200° C., preferably from 90 to 150° C., more preferably from 100 to 145° C. Typically, the mixing time is from 10 to 60 seconds, preferably from 20 to 40 seconds. Sulphur is preferably added as late as possible in the process, preferably in step (iii). Sulphur is preferably added in the form of pellets. The sulphur and the resin-based binder may be added together, i.e. both in step (i), step (ii) or step (iii). In a first embodiment, the hot aggregate is mixed with the sulphur and the resin-based binder. Hot bitumen is then added to the hot aggregate-sulphur-resin-based binder mixture. In a second embodiment, hot aggregate is mixed with hot bitumen, and the sulphur and the resin-based binder are added to the hot bitumen-aggregate mixture. This embodiment offers the advantage of producing a stronger sulphur-asphalt mixture strength. In a third embodiment, hot bitumen is mixed with sulphur and the resin binder and the resulting hot bitumen-sulphur-resin-based binder mixture is mixed with hot aggregate to obtain a sulphur-comprising asphalt mixture. Alternatively, in the asphalt manufacture process the resin-based binder may be added separately. For example, the resin-based binder may be added to the bitumen in step (i) and the sulphur may be added in step (iii). In one embodiment of the invention, the sulphur and the resin-based binder are added together; the sulphur is in the form of pellets and the resin-based binder is incorporated in the sulphur pellets. The sulphur pellets preferably comprise from 0.05 to 10 wt % of the resin-based binder, based upon the weight of the sulphur. The sulphur pellets are suitably prepared by a process wherein liquid sulphur is mixed with the resin-based binder and optionally additional components such as, anionic/cationic/amphoteric surfactant, carbon black and amyl acetate. The mixture is then shaped and/or pelletised. In one embodiment of the invention sulphur may be added in the form of two types of sulphur pellets; a first type of sulphur pellet that comprises the resin-based binder and a second type of sulphur pellet that does not comprise the resin-based binder. This has the advantage that the resin-based binder is essentially concentrated in the first type of sulphur pellet and conventional sulphur pellets can be used to make up the rest of the sulphur requirement. The invention further provides a process for preparing an asphalt pavement, wherein asphalt is prepared by a process according to the invention, and further comprising steps of: (iv) spreading the asphalt into a layer; and (v) compacting the layer. The invention further provides an asphalt pavement prepared by the process according to the invention. The compaction in step (v) suitably takes place at a temperature of from 80 to 200° C., preferably from 90 to 150° C., more preferably from 100 to 145° C. The temperature of compaction is desirably kept as low as possible in order to reduce hydrogen sulphide emissions. However, the temperature of compaction needs to be sufficiently high such that the voids content of the resulting asphalt is sufficiently low for the asphalt to be durable and water resistant. The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following Examples, which are not intended to limit the scope invention. EXAMPLES A blend of elemental sulphur and bitumen was heated to 145-148° C. The bitumen was a 60/70 penetration grade bitumen and the weight ratio of sulphur:bitumen was 30:70. Mexphalte CLT (a resin-based binder commercially available from Shell Bitumen) was added while the stirring was continued for 3 hours. Evaporated sulphur was collected on a filter paper for 3 hours and its weight was measured gravimetrically to determine the sulphur loss. This was compared with the control experiment with no additive to measure % sulphur loss. It was observed that sulphur loss varied between control experiments; this may have been due to inhomogeneous stirring or bitumen aging effects. To ensure that an accurate comparison could be made between experimental examples and control examples, a control example was carried out alongside each experimental example. Additive amounts are reported as weight percentages, based upon the weight of the sulphur. Results are shown in Table 1: TABLE 1 Wt % resin-based Sulphur Sulphur binder (wt % based reduction % reduction % on weight of S) Run 1 Run 2 Experiment 1 6 21 15 Even though the experiments do not relate to asphalt compositions of the invention (the experimental blends comprise bitumen, sulphur and resin-based binder but no aggregate), the inventors believe that the results demonstrate a significant reduction in elemental sulphur vapour which would also be experienced when blending bitumen, sulphur, aggregate and resin-based binder. The experiments showed a significant reduction in sulphur vapour. 1.
