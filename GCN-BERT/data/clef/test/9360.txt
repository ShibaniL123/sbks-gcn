DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS A game system according to an embodiment enables a player to intervene casually in a game played by another player, and enjoy the game together with the other player. Hereinafter, for the convenience of description, the player as a side subjected to intervention will be referred to as a “first player,” and the player as an intervening side will be referred to as a “second player.” The second player is in charge of control of only part of functions of the game being played by the first player. Unlike a mere gallery, the second player intervenes in the game through instruction input for controlling the function that the second player himself/herself is in charge of. However, unlike the first player as the original player of the game, the second player does not take part in control of the whole of the game. Hence, it suffices for the second player to be in charge of only control of the part of the functions of the game with a high degree of difficulty. The second player can therefore enjoy the game by casually intervening in the game of the first player. In addition, the first player can enjoy the game together with the second player. Thus, the first player can have an enjoyment different from that of sole play, and enjoy the game without losing interest over a long period of time. First Embodiment FIG. 1 shows a general constitution of a game system according to a first embodiment. The game system 1 includes a matching server 100 managing matching between players of game devices, a first game device 10 of a first player, and a second game device 200 of a second player. The matching server 100 manages matching between the first player and the second player. The first player of the first game device 10 requests, via the Internet 2, the matching server 100 to invite the second player in charge of control of part of functions of a game executed in the first game device 10. The second player of the second game device 200 connects to the matching server 100 via the Internet 2, checks conditions of invitation to intervention in games executed in other first game devices 10, and selects a game in which the second player desires to intervene. When the second player of the second game device 200 selects the game in which the second player desires to intervene, the matching server 100 notifies information on the second game device 200 to the first game device 10 executing the selected game. The first game device 10 makes the game as a whole progress while receiving operation instructions for controlling the part of the functions subjected to the intervention from the second game device 200, and leaving the control of the part of the functions to the second game device 200. A game of a tower defense type whose objective is to defend a tower provided in a territory by defeating enemies invading the own territory in a game field will be described in the following as an example of the game. In the game according to the present embodiment, the first player disposes batteries (cannons) in a path of invasion by the enemies in the game field, and attacks the invading enemies. The first player can allow the second player to be in charge of a function of attacking the enemies from a disposed battery. FIG. 2 shows a configuration of the first game device 10 according to the first embodiment. The first game device 10 includes a controller 20, a communicating section 30, a control section 40, a game data retaining section 60, a screen generating section 66, and a display device 68. These configurations are implemented, in terms of hardware components, by the CPU of an arbitrary computer, a memory, a program loaded in the memory, and the like. In this case, however, the functional blocks implemented by cooperation of these configurations are depicted. Hence, it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that these functional blocks can be implemented in various forms by only hardware, only software, or combinations of hardware and software. The communicating section 30 controls communication via the Internet 2. The communicating section 30 transmits and receives data to and from the matching server 100 and the second game device 200 via the Internet 2. The control section 40 makes the game progress on the basis of operating input from the player which operating input is received by the controller 20. The game data retaining section 60 retains data necessary for the progress of the game and the like. The game data retaining section 60 includes a cannon database 63, a sniper database 64, and a wave database 65. The screen generating section 66 generates the screen of the game controlled by the control section 40, and makes the screen displayed on the display device 68. FIG. 3 shows an external appearance of the controller 20. The upper surface of the controller 20 is provided with direction keys 21, a triangle button 22, a square button 23, a circle button 24, a cross button 25, and analog sticks 26 and 27. In addition, the side surface of the controller 20 is provided with an L1 button 28a, an L2 button 28b, an R1 button 29a, and an R2 button 29b. FIG. 4 shows an example of internal data of the cannon database 63. The cannon database 63 includes a battery ID field 70, a battery classification field 71, a maximum power field 72, a maximum burst field 73, a position field 74, a price field 75, and a control field 76. The battery ID field 70 stores the ID of a battery provided in the own territory within the game field. The battery classification field 71 stores the classification of the battery. In the game according to the present embodiment, two kinds of batteries, that is, large batteries and small batteries can be installed. The maximum power field 72 stores the maximum power of the battery. The maximum burst field 73 stores a maximum number of consecutive shots of the battery. The position field 74 stores coordinates indicating a position at which the battery is disposed. The price field 75 stores a price necessary to dispose the battery. The control field 76 stores an entity that controls the battery. As will be described later, in a normal mode, all batteries are automatically controlled by a normal mode control unit 46, whereas in an intervention mode, the battery to which the second player is assigned is controlled by the second player of the second game device 200 via an intervention mode control unit 45, and a battery to which the second player is not assigned is automatically controlled by a normal mode control unit 46. FIG. 5 shows an example of internal data of the sniper database 64. The sniper database 64 includes a user ID field 80 and a battery ID field 81. The user ID field 80 stores the user ID of the second player assigned to the battery. The battery ID field 81 stores the battery ID of the battery to which the second player is assigned. FIG. 6 shows an example of internal data of the wave database 65. The wave database 65 includes a wave number field 90, a consecutive number field 91, a maximum power field 92, an interval field 93, and a speed field 94. The wave number field 90 stores the number of a wave. The consecutive number field 91 stores a consecutive number of attacks of enemies included in the wave. The maximum power field 92 stores the maximum power of the enemies included in the wave. The interval field 93 stores intervals between the attacks of the plurality of enemies included in the wave. The speed field 94 stores the speed of the attacks of the enemies included in the wave. Returning to FIG. 2, the control section 40 includes a game control unit 41, a mode selecting unit 42, an intervention requesting unit 43, an instruction input receiving unit 44, an intervention mode control unit 45, and a normal mode control unit 46. The instruction input receiving unit 44 receives instruction input from the first player via the controller 20. The instruction input receiving unit 44 notifies the received instruction input to other configurations of the control section that controls the game, for example, the game control unit 41, the mode selecting unit 42, the normal mode control unit 46, and the like. The game control unit 41 receives the instruction input from the player, and controls the game. In the present embodiment, as described earlier, the game control unit 41 controls the game of the tower defense type. The game control unit 41 disposes batteries in the game field according to the instruction input from the first player, and stores information on the disposed batteries in the cannon database 63. After the disposition of the batteries is ended, the game control unit 41 refers to the wave database 65, creates a wave, and makes the enemy legion invade the game field. When enemies reach the tower, the game control unit 41 decreases the life of the first player according to the number of the enemies that have reached the tower. The game is over when the life becomes zero. When all of enemies included in the wave are annihilated before the life becomes zero, the game is cleared. The mode selecting unit 42 receives, from the player, a selection of one of an intervention mode in which part of functions of the game controlled by the game control unit 41 is controlled according to instruction input from the second game device 200 different from the first game device 10 that includes the control section 40 and a normal mode in which the part of the functions is controlled without depending on the instruction input from the second game device 200. As described earlier, in the present embodiment, the second game device 200 is allowed to take charge of control of a battery in the game of the tower defense type. When the intervention mode is selected, the intervention requesting unit 43 requests the control of the battery from another game device. As will be described later, in the present embodiment, the intervention requesting unit 43 requests the matching server 100 to invite a second game device 200 that intervenes. In another example, the intervention requesting unit 43 may directly request a particular second game device 200 to intervene, or the intervention requesting unit 43 itself may invite a second game device 200 that intervenes. For example, the second game device 200 of a second player registered in a player database not shown in the figure may be directly requested to intervene. In addition, another game device presents in a neighborhood may be requested to intervene by radio communication, or an intervention request may be broadcast to a particular network. When the second game device 200 that intervenes is determined, the intervention requesting unit 43 obtains information on the second game device 200, and stores the information on the second game device 200 in the sniper database 64. When a plurality of second game devices 200 are made to take charge of control of a plurality of batteries, the intervention requesting unit 43 may automatically determine the batteries assigned to the second game devices 200 according to information on the second game devices 200, for example the attributes of the second players or the like, or may determine the batteries assigned to the second game devices 200 according to an instruction from the first player. The intervention mode control unit 45 transmits information necessary to control the battery to the second game device 200 of the second player assigned to the battery in response to a request from the intervention requesting unit 43. The intervention mode control unit 45 receives instruction input by the second player from the second game device 200, and controls the battery assigned to the second game device 200. The normal mode control unit 46 automatically controls the battery when the normal mode is selected. The normal mode control unit 46 generates instruction input for controlling the battery according to predetermined conditions, and controls the battery. Also in the intervention mode, the normal mode control unit 46 controls a battery that is not controlled by the second player. The intervention mode control unit 45 and the normal mode control unit 46 may share part of functions. For example, an algorithm for receiving designations of a sight, power, and the number of consecutive shots and shelling enemies from batteries may be common. The instructions of a sight, power, and the number of consecutive shots may be received from the second player via the intervention mode control unit 45 in the intervention mode, and may be automatically generated by the normal mode control unit 46 in the normal mode. The intervention mode control unit 45 may correct operation instructions received from the second player according to the attributes or level of the second player who controls the battery. For example, when the level of the second player is lower than a predetermined value, the sight may be corrected to an enemy presents within a predetermined range of the position of the received sight. FIG. 7 shows a configuration of the second game device 200 according to the first embodiment. The second game device 200 includes an input section 220, a communicating section 230, a control section 240, a game data retaining section 260, a screen generating section 266, and a display device 268. These configurations can also be implemented in various forms by only hardware, only software, or combinations of hardware and software. The communicating section 230 controls communication via the Internet 2. The communicating section 230 transmits and receives data to and from the matching server 100 and the first game device 10 via the Internet 2. The control section 240 makes the game progress on the basis of operating input from the player which operating input is received by the input section 220. The game data retaining section 260 retains data necessary for the progress of the game and the like. The screen generating section 66 generates the screen of the game controlled by the control section 240, and makes the screen displayed on the display device 268. The control section 240 includes an intervention applying unit 241, a game data receiving unit 242, an intervention game control unit 243, and an instruction input transmitting unit 244. The intervention applying unit 241 accesses the matching server 100, obtains information on first game devices 10 requesting intervention, and displays the information on the first game devices 10 on the display device 268. The intervention applying unit 241 receives a selection of a first game device 10 that the second player is to intervene with, and applies to the matching server 100 for intervention with the first game device 10. The game data receiving unit 242 receives game data necessary for intervention from the first game device 10 that the intervention applying unit 241 has applied for intervention with, and stores the game data in the game data retaining section 260. The game data receiving unit 242 receives a program for performing functions of the game in which the second game device 200 intervenes (which game will hereinafter be referred to as an “intervention game”), data necessary for generating a game screen, and the like. The intervention game control unit 243 refers to the game data stored in the game data retaining section 260, and controls intervention in the game being executed in the first game device 10. The intervention game control unit 243 may refer to the game data stored in the game data retaining section 260, generate a game screen of the intervention game, and display the game screen on the display device 268, or may display a game screen generated by the first game device 10 on the display device 268. The instruction input transmitting unit 244 receives instruction input by the second player for the intervention game controlled by the intervention game control unit 243 via the input section 220, and transmits the instruction input to the first game device 10. The second game device 200 controls only part of functions of the game executed in the first game device 10. The second game device 200 may therefore be a game device including hardware resources having lower specifications than the first game device 10. For example, the display device may be smaller than that of the first game device 10, CPU processing speed may be slower than that of the first game device 10, or memory capacity may be lower than that of the first game device 10. For example, the second game device 200 may be a portable gaming device, a mobile telephone, a smart phone, or the like. Hence, the second player can casually participate in and enjoy the game even when the second player does not have the first game device 10 necessary for executing the game. FIG. 8 shows an example of a game screen displayed on the display device 68 of the first game device 10. The game screen 300 displays a tower 302 and batteries 306a and 306b provided in a game field. When the first player gives an instruction to start a wave after disposing the batteries 306a and 306b in the vicinity of a path of invasion 304 by enemies 308, the game control unit 41 makes the enemies 308 invade along the path of invasion 304 according to settings stored in the wave database 65. In the normal mode, the normal mode control unit 46 controls the batteries 306a and 306b to attack the enemies 308 from the batteries 306a and 306b. FIG. 9 shows an example of a game screen displayed on the display device 68 of the first game device 10. The game screen 310 is an example of a game screen in the intervention mode. In the example shown in FIG. 9, the battery 306a is controlled by the second player. The intervention mode control unit 45 receives instruction input for controlling the battery 306a from the second game device 200 of the second player, and controls the battery 306a according to the instruction input. The battery 306b is controlled by the normal mode control unit 46. FIG. 10 shows an example of a game screen displayed on the display device 268 of the second game device 200. Unlike the game screen 310 displayed on the first game device 10, the game screen 320 displayed on the second game device 200 does not display the entire game field, but displays only the state of the game field as viewed from the battery 306a controlled by the second game device 200. The second player operates a sight 322 for attack from the battery 306a, and attacks the enemies 308. The instruction input transmitting unit 244 transmits instruction input by the second player to the first game device 10. The screen generating section 266 generates the game screen 320 reflecting the instruction input by the second player which instruction input is transmitted to the first game device 10, and displays the game screen 320 on the display device 268. FIG. 11 shows a configuration of the matching server 100 according to the first embodiment. The matching server 100 includes a communicating section 130, a control section 140, and a player database 160. These configurations can also be implemented in various forms by only hardware, only software, or combinations of hardware and software. The communicating section 130 controls communication via the Internet 2. The communicating section 130 transmits and receives data to and from the first game device 10 and the second game device 200 via the Internet 2. The control section 140 controls matching between the first game device 10 and the second game device 200. The player database 160 stores information on the players of the first game device 10 and the second game device 200. The control section 140 includes an intervention request receiving unit 141, an intervention inviting unit 142, an intervention application receiving unit 143, and a notifying unit 144. The intervention request receiving unit 141 receives, from the first game device 10, a request to invite the second game device 200 in game play in the intervention mode in which part of functions of the game controlled by the first game device 10 is controlled according to instruction input from the second game device 200 different from the first game device 10. The intervention inviting unit 142 presents information on the part of the functions of the game controlled by the first game device 10 whose request for the invitation is received by the intervention request receiving unit 141, and invites the second player for controlling the part of the functions. The intervention application receiving unit 143 receives an application for intervention by the second player in response to the invitation by the intervention inviting unit 142. The intervention application receiving unit 143 receives information on the second game device 200 of the second player who has applied for the intervention, and stores the information in the player database 160. The notifying unit 144 reads out, from the player database 160, the information on the second game device 200 from which the application is received by the intervention application receiving unit 143, and notifies the information on the second game device 200 to the first game device 10. FIG. 12 shows an example of an intervention application receiving screen presented by the intervention inviting unit 142. The intervention application receiving screen 400 presents, as contents of the invitation to intervention which contents are received by the intervention request receiving unit 141, the title of the game being executed in the first game device 10, information on an intervening function, and information on the name of the first player of the first game device 10 or the like. The second player looks at the intervention application receiving screen 400, and selects the game of the first game device 10 in which game the second player applies for intervention. When the second player clicks an intervention application button 402, the intervention application receiving unit 143 receives information on the second game device 200 from the second game device 200, and the notifying unit 144 notifies the information on the second game device 200 to the first game device 10. Thereafter direct communication is performed between the first game device 10 and the second game device 200. FIG. 13 shows another example of the intervention application receiving screen presented by the intervention inviting unit 142. The intervention application receiving screen 410 presents, as contents of the invitation to intervention which contents are received by the intervention request receiving unit 141, information indicating whether the second player is desired to intervene in a covering manner or desired to intervene in an obstructing manner. In the present example, the intervention requesting unit 43 of the first game device 10 notifies the intervention request receiving unit 141 of the matching server 100 whether to request an invitation to intervention in a first mode such as is advantageous for the progress of the game controlled by the control section 40 or to request an invitation to intervention in a second mode such as is disadvantageous for the progress of the game. The intervention inviting unit 142 of the matching server 100 further presents the intervention mode received by the intervention request receiving unit 141, and invites intervention by the second player. When the second player desires intervention in a covering manner in which the second player makes the game progress while cooperating with the first player, the second player selects intervention with the first game device 10 of the first player who desires intervention in the first mode. When the second player desires intervention in an obstructing manner that obstructs the progress of the game by the first player, the second player selects intervention with the first game device 10 of the first player who desires intervention in the second mode. When the second player clicks an intervention application button 412, the intervention application receiving unit 143 receives information on the second game device 200 from the second game device 200, and the notifying unit 144 notifies the information on the second game device 200 to the first game device 10. The intervention requesting unit 43 of the first game device 10 may automatically select whether to request an invitation to intervention in the first mode or to request an invitation to intervention in the second mode. For example, the intervention requesting unit 43 may obtain a parameter indicating the conditions of progress of the game controlled by the control section 40. When the parameter indicates conditions worse than predetermined conditions, the intervention requesting unit 43 may request the matching server 100 to invite intervention in the first mode. When the parameter indicates conditions better than the predetermined conditions, the intervention requesting unit 43 may request the matching server 100 to invite intervention in the second mode. In addition, when the level of the first player with regard to the game controlled by the control section 40 is lower than a predetermined level, the intervention requesting unit 43 may request the matching server 100 to invite intervention in the first mode. When the level of the first player is equal to or higher than the predetermined level, the intervention requesting unit 43 may request the matching server 100 to invite intervention in the second mode. The intervention request receiving unit 141 of the matching server 100 may automatically select whether to request an invitation to intervention in the first mode or to request an invitation to intervention in the second mode. For example, the intervention inviting unit 142 may obtain a parameter indicating conditions of progress of the game controlled by the first player. When the parameter indicates conditions worse than predetermined conditions, the intervention inviting unit 142 may make a presentation to the effect that intervention in the first mode is invited. When the parameter indicates conditions better than the predetermined conditions, the intervention inviting unit 142 may make a presentation to the effect that intervention in the second mode is invited. The intervention request receiving unit 141 may further receive a condition for the second player who intervenes, and the intervention inviting unit 142 may further present the received condition. For example, a condition that the level of the second player with regard to the game in which the second player is to intervene be equal to or higher than a predetermined level may be presented. In this case, the intervention application receiving unit 143 may determine whether or not the second player applying for intervention satisfies the condition, and refuse the application of the second player who does not satisfy the condition. FIG. 14 is a flowchart of a procedure of a game control method according to the first embodiment. The game control unit 41 and the normal mode control unit 46 of the first game device 10 control the game in the normal mode according to instruction input from the first player which instruction input is received by the instruction input receiving unit 44 (S10). When the mode selecting unit 42 receives an instruction to switch to the intervention mode from the first player (S11), the intervention requesting unit 43 requests the matching server 100 to invite the second player who intervenes (S12). When the intervention request receiving unit 141 of the matching server 100 receives the request to invite intervention from the first game device 10, the intervention inviting unit 142 invites the second player who intervenes (S14). When the second player applies for intervention from the second game device 200 to the matching server 100 (S16), the intervention application receiving unit 143 receives information on the second game device 200 which information is transmitted from the second game device 200 (S18). The notifying unit 144 notifies the information on the second game device 200 to the first game device 10 (S20). The intervention mode control unit 45 transmits data necessary for executing the intervention game to the second game device 200 (S22). The instruction input transmitting unit 244 of the second game device 200 transmits instruction input by the second player for controlling the intervention game to the first game device 10 (S24). The intervention mode control unit 45 controls the intervention game in the intervention mode according to instruction input by the second player which instruction input is received from the second game device 200 (S26). In the above-described example, the second game device 200 does not have the functions of the game control unit 41, and the progress of the game as a whole is controlled by the control section 40 of the first game device 10. In another example, the second game device 200 may have a similar configuration to that of the first game device 10, and the control sections 40 of both of the first game device 10 and the second game device 200 may control the game as a whole. In this case, information for synchronizing the progress of the game may be exchanged between the control section 40 of the first game device 10 and the control section 40 of the second game device 200. According to the embodiment, it suffices for the second player to control only part of functions. The second player can therefore casually enjoy the game even when the game requires a high skill level. In addition, it is possible to experience the game actually and actively by intervening as the second player. It is therefore possible to understand the contents of the game, and experience a view of the world of the game. Thus, opportunities for enjoying the game casually can be provided widely, so that the spread of the game can be promoted. Second Embodiment FIG. 15 shows a general constitution of a game system according to a second embodiment. The game system 1 includes a matching server 100 managing matching between players of game devices, a first game device 10 of a first player, a second game device 200 of a second player, and a game server 500 that controls a game. Unlike the first embodiment, the second embodiment enables intervention in an online game controlled by the game server 500 rather than the game controlled by the first game device 10. The first player can connect to the game server 500 from the first game device 10 and enjoy the online game alone, or can enjoy the online game together with the second player while receiving intervention by the second player of the second game device 200. The following description will be made mainly of differences from the first embodiment.

In the latter case, for example, the intervention requesting unit 43 may obtain a parameter indicating conditions of progress of the game. When the parameter indicates conditions worse than predetermined conditions, the intervention requesting unit 43 may request the matching server 100 to invite intervention in the first mode. When the parameter indicates conditions better than the predetermined conditions, the intervention requesting unit 43 may request the matching server 100 to invite intervention in the second mode. In addition, when the level of the first player with regard to the game controlled by the control section is lower than a predetermined level, the intervention requesting unit 43 may request the matching server 100 to invite intervention in the first mode. When the level of the first player is equal to or higher than the predetermined level, the intervention requesting unit 43 may request the matching server 100 to invite intervention in the second mode. When the intervention inviting unit 142 of the matching server 100 is requested from one game device to invite intervention, the intervention inviting unit 142 may not invite intervention with the other game device, or may invite intervention with the other game device in an opposite mode. The intervention request receiving unit 141 of the matching server 100 may automatically select whether to request an invitation to intervention in the first mode or to request an invitation to intervention in the second mode. For example, the intervention request receiving unit 141 may obtain a parameter indicating conditions of progress of the battle game. When the parameter indicates that the first game device 10 is at a disadvantage, the intervention inviting unit 142 may make a presentation to the effect that intervention with the first game device 10 in the first mode is invited and intervention with the third game device in the second mode is invited. When the parameter indicates that the first game device 10 is at an advantage, the intervention inviting unit 142 may make a presentation to the effect that intervention with the first game device 10 in the second mode is invited and intervention with the third game device in the first mode is invited. In addition, the intervention request receiving unit 141 may obtain the levels of the players of the first game device 10 and the third game device. When the level of the player of the first game device 10 is lower than the level of the player of the third game device, the intervention inviting unit 142 may make a presentation to the effect that intervention with the first game device 10 in the first mode is invited and intervention with the third game device in the second mode is invited. When the level of the player of the first game device 10 is higher than the level of the player of the third game device, the intervention inviting unit 142 may make a presentation to the effect that intervention with the first game device 10 in the second mode is invited and intervention with the third game device in the first mode is invited. When a difference between the levels of the first player and the third player is less than a predetermined value, the intervention of the second player may not be invited. When the difference between the levels is equal to or more than the predetermined value, the intervention of the second player may be invited. The present invention has been described above on the basis of embodiments thereof. The embodiments are illustrative, and it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that combinations of constituent elements and processing processes of the embodiments are susceptible of various modifications and that such modifications also fall within the scope of the present invention. A service may be provided which enables chats, messages, and the like to be transmitted and received between the first player or the third player and the second player who intervenes. In addition, the second player who has intervened may be provided with benefits such as points or the like. In the foregoing embodiment, a game of the tower defense type has been described, but there may be games of other types. For example, in a game in which a player's character and an enemy character move in a game field, the second player may control part of the movement, attack, action, and the like of the enemy character or a character on the player side. In addition, the second player may control the disposition, movement, changing, and the like of an item, an obstacle, and the like disposed in a game field. In addition, the second player may control the timing, kind, and the like of an event occurring in a game field. There may be a training type simulation game related to one or a plurality of characters. For example, in a game in which a soccer team is trained, the first player may train the team as a coach, and the second player may control part of individual players. In addition, in a game in which a racing team is trained, the second player may control a driver. The individual characters of these games are automatically controlled by a computer in a normal mode. There may be a so-called falling object puzzle in which objects are made to fall in a game field and objects satisfying a predetermined condition are erased. The second player may control a kind of object to be made to fall in the game field next. In the foregoing embodiment, intervention in the game by the second player is realized in a form of allowing the second player to control part of functions of the game. However, the function controlled by the second player may be a function not provided in the normal mode. Specifically, the second player may be allowed to control a new function of covering or obstructing the progress of the game by the first player. For example, in a game that sets an objective of performing specified operating input so as to be well timed to music, the second player may be allowed to insert interjections by controlling the output of a particular sound. In addition, in a shooting game, a golf game, or the like, the second player may be allowed to assist in operating input by the first player, or perform particular operating input for improving accuracy, power, or the like.
