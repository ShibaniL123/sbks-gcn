Example 39. 3-((4-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)piperidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile
70.0 mg of N-methyl-N-(piperidine-4-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.50 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 61.0 mg of 3-cyanobenzenesulfonyl chloride was added into the solution, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0790 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 23.1 mg of 3-((4-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)piperidine-1-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile was obtained with a yield of about 19.6%.
