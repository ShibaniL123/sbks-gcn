Object of the Invention The present invention relates to the viticulture industry, and more specifically to methods of treatment, fermentation and vinification of the must. The primary object of the present invention is a method for fermenting must, as well as a fermentation vat, which fundamentally stand out because they allow efficient breaking and movement of the "cap" formed in the top part of the vat, thereby maximizing the transfer of the content of the skins and accordingly increasing the quality of the final wine produced. Background of the Invention Fermentation is known today as the method whereby the sugars contained in must are converted into ethyl alcohol, ultimately producing wine. The presence of yeasts, which consist of microorganisms present in the fruit, is necessary to carry out said method for fermenting. Therefore, yeasts of the genus Saccharomyces, which are facultative anaerobic yeasts, i.e., they are able to perform said fermentation in the absence of oxygen, are generally used in fermentation. Nevertheless, oxygen is a key parameter in the method for fermenting because yeasts need it during their growth phase. Also, another important factor in fermentation is pH due to its importance in controlling bacterial contamination, as well as its effect on the growth of yeasts, the rate of fermentation and the formation of alcohol. It is currently known that the lower the pH of the medium, the lower the risk of infection, but when working with very low pH levels, fermentation is very slow because the yeast does not develop suitably. According to many studies, the pH that is most favorable for the growth of yeasts is between 4.4 and 5.0, 4.5 being the most optimal value. In addition to ethanol, another product resulting from fermentation is carbon dioxide or carbonic anhydride (CO2) in the gaseous state, which causes the characteristic bubbling, boiling and aroma of a vat with fermenting must. Said boiling makes the solid parts of the grapes (skins) rise to the surface of the vat, forming a floating layer in the top part thereof, generally referred to as a "cap". This cap yields to the must a large amount of substances contained in the skins (primarily tannins, anthocyanins and flavonoids), as a result of which the wine acquires its characteristic reddish color, its aroma, etc. So for extracting said substances existing in the skins, and mixing them with the must that is being fermented, it is necessary to break, soak, move, and even, if possible, submerge said cap, preventing it from solidifying. Today, the most widely used method for breaking and moving the cap formed in the top part of fermentation vats is known as "pumping over", which consists of taking must from the lower part of the vat and feeding it to the top part, and then spraying and discharging it directly on the cap (ES2190301). This operation is performed three or four times a day, the primary drawback being the high economic cost it entails due to the number of necessary pumps, pipes and valves, not to mention that said pumping over method changes the properties of the wine, causing the partial loss of its aroma. Furthermore, said method requires continuous control and follow-up by qualified staff, which again increases costs. Finally, it must be pointed out that this system does not completely "break" the cap. On the other hand, there are other systems that break or submerge the cap by means of mechanical elements, such as cylinders, blades, pneumatic pistons, worm screws, etc., all of them being complex as regards installation, mounting and use, making the installation substantially more expensive. Systems based on an overhead crane responsible for lifting a small reservoir (OVI, from the Spanish expression "objeto volador identificado" (identified flying object)) to soak the cap, and thereby dispense with pumps and pipes, are also known in the state of the art. The main objective of these systems is to obtain wine having a higher quality and longer lifespan, achieving better qualities in the aging of the wine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these installations have mounting, maintenance and use costs far exceeding those of a winery provided with a conventional pumping over system. Finally, the translation of European patent ES2181035 T3 is known, which discloses a fermenter requiring the installation of at least one diaphragm having a concave configuration arranged inside the fermentation vat, and the system of which for moving the "cap" basically consists of accumulating carbon dioxide bubbles generated during fermentation, retaining them by means of said diaphragms until the bubbles have reached a larger dimension. Therefore, through the upward movement of the larger-sized bubbles, once said bubbles have escaped and are released from the diaphragms, remixing of the cap floating on the must is achieved. Therefore, it has been detected that current fermentation systems have several drawbacks, among which the following stand out: they are very complex from a structural viewpoint as they require the construction and installation of a number of parts and components in the fermentation vat;they perform the must soaking and mixing phases by means of pouring and pumping liquid;they do not allow automating the method for fermenting, depending directly on human operators and affecting the quality of the final wine produced;the compressors used have greases and oils, which are contaminating elements for the method for fermenting;they do not allow oxygenating or aerating the must to be fermented, which can cause death of the yeasts, and therefore premature stopping of the method for fermenting;they do not allow controlling the pH of the must;fouling accumulates in reservoirs, with the enormous negative effect this entails in the entire method for fermenting and the subsequent loss of quality of the final wine produced;they make it difficult to perform cleaning and maintenance tasks on the inner part of the fermentation vat;they involve considerable manual labor and power consumption costs, significantly increasing total installation costs. Description of the Invention The drawbacks mentioned above are solved by means of the present invention by providing a method for fermenting must, and a fermentation vat, which allow obtaining the efficient breaking and movement of the layer of skins, or "cap", created spontaneously in the top part of the must during fermentation, thereby maximizing the transfer of the content of the skins to the wine, preserving the characteristic aroma and color of the wine, and accordingly increasing the final quality thereof. All this is done with minimal power consumption and a substantial reduction of manual labor, where the entire method for fermenting is controlled through an automatism. The method for fermenting and fermentation vat herein described stand out because, in addition to their simple execution, structural simplicity and low cost, they allow oxygenation or aeration of the must, which allows assuring that the fermentation performed by the yeasts will not be stopped, said fermentation being performed quickly and completely, thereby favoring the possibility of using one and the same fermentation vat several times in the same harvest. More particularly, the method for fermenting must of the present invention is of the type performed in a fermentation vat for producing wine, where said method for fermenting comprises a phase of breaking and remixing a floating layer of skins formed on the surface of the must while it is being fermented. Said phase of breaking comprises the following steps: a) suctioning CO2 gas generated during fermentation of the must, said suctioning being performed in the fermentation vat above the layer of skins; b) mixing said suctioned CO2 gas with outside air to favor oxygenation of the wine; and c) introducing the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air into the fermentation vat, said mixture being expelled into the must below the layer of skins, generating bubbles formed by CO2 gas and air which, in their upward movement towards the surface, cause the recirculation of the liquid, causing the breaking and movement of said layer of skins. It should be pointed out that the suctioning of CO2 gas of step a) is strategically performed in the position indicated above, in the fermentation vat above the layer of skins, because since the density of CO2 gas is greater than the density of air, the air existing inside the fermentation vat therefore experiences a spontaneous outward displacement, exiting through the top opening of the vat, and the space existing between the layer of skins and said top opening of the fermentation vat being filled with CO2 gas, favoring the suctioning thereof. Use of a lid or cover on the fermentation vat is therefore dispensed with, allowing the enologist or qualified person in question to control at all times the state of fermentation of the must. Furthermore, said suctioning of CO2 gas of step a) is preferably performed by means of at least one suction filter which collects and filters CO2 gas, separating it from the remaining gases, for more optimal execution and development of the method for fermenting herein described. It has also been envisaged that the outside air intended for being mixed in step b) is previously regulated through at least one aeration valve, thereby achieving a greater or lesser inlet of air, which allows increasing or reducing oxygenation of the wine. At this point it should be indicated that it has been envisaged that said regulation of air can be done manually by qualified staff or automatically through a sensor preferably located inside the fermentation vat and adapted for detecting the amount of oxygen existing in the must, said sensor being connected to the aeration valve. In turn, step b) is preferably performed by means of a compressor that mixes and compresses CO2 gas and outside air. It should be pointed out at this point that oxygenation of the must allows controlling the pH level of the must at optimal values, preventing it from being very low, which would affect the rate of fermentation performed by the yeasts, and also preventing said pH from being very high, which could cause the presence of bacteria in the wine. It should furthermore be borne in mind that pH is likewise related to the taste of the wine, so the method for fermenting herein described likewise achieves optimization of this parameter. Finally, it must be indicated that said oxygenation also allows controlling the oxidation-reduction potential (redox potential) of wine, which is extremely important in maturation of the final wine produced. With respect to step c), said step is preferably performed by means of at least one injection conduit which is introduced inside the fermentation vat, where the mixture of CO2 gas and air is expelled through at least one diffuser nozzle connected to the injection conduit. Said diffuser nozzle is preferably a rotary nozzle for greater homogenization, distribution and uniformity of CO2 and air bubbles throughout the must contained in the fermentation vat, it having nevertheless been envisaged for said diffuser nozzle to have multiple configurations. In turn, the injection conduit is preferably introduced inside the fermentation vat through the actual top opening of the vat. It should be pointed out that the method for fermenting of the present invention is of particular interest in "tumultuous" fermentation, which is the most active phase of fermentation. Therefore, the down-top displacement of the CO2 gas and air bubbles causes continuous and constant movement of the layer of skins, which allows homogenously mixing their content with the must that is being fermented. On the other hand, the method for fermenting herein described is also of interest for "malo-lactic" fermentation, after the aforementioned tumultuous fermentation, and where malic acid is converted into lactic acid, thereby reducing the pH level of the wine and achieving more degrees of color. Furthermore, it should be indicated as an additional advantage that by means of the method for fermenting of the present invention it is not necessary to perform the phase of "rack-and-return" ("delestaje" in Spanish from the French term "délestage") because the skins precipitate to the bottom of the fermentation vat in a natural manner, thereby reducing total costs of the method for fermenting. It should be borne in mind that said "rack-and-return" consists of taking the wine out of the fermentation vat and introducing it in another reservoir, then leaving the solids to precipitate to the bottom of the fermentation vat, to subsequently again add the wine to the skins deposited at the bottom of the vat. According to another object of the invention, there is described below a fermentation vat, which comprises a reservoir intended for housing the must; at least one suction filter for suctioning CO2 gas; at least one aeration valve that allows regulating the amount of outside air to be introduced into the fermentation vat; a compressor for mixing and compressing the suctioned CO2 gas through the suction filter and the outside air coming from the aeration valve; at least one injection conduit connected to the compressor that allows introducing the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air inside the fermentation vat; and at least one diffuser nozzle connected to the injection conduit and provided with outlet jets for expelling said mixture of CO2 gas and outside air. More specifically, the compressor in turn comprises at least two centrifugal pumps, where each of them comprises a leak-tight inner chamber with its corresponding inlet and outlet for circulation of the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air coming from the suction filter and the aeration valve, respectively; and a manifold connecting the outlet of the first centrifugal pump with the inlet of the second centrifugal pump for serial flow and sequential compression of the mixture through said centrifugal pumps. Therefore, the centrifugal pumps are connected to one another through the manifold, such that the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air compressed by the first centrifugal pump is then suctioned and compressed by the second centrifugal pump for the final propelling thereof into the fermentation vat through the injection conduit. Optimal pressure of the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air is thereby achieved for the propelling thereof through the jets of the diffuser nozzle, said pressure being a key parameter for being able to move and mix all the must contained inside the fermentation vat, and therefore improving the quality of the final wine produced. Said centrifugal pumps preferably comprise an internal electric motor, connected to the power grid for the electric power supply thereof, said motors comprising their corresponding rotation shafts. In turn, the inner chambers comprise at least one inner impeller fixed integrally to the rotation shaft of the electric motor, so activation of the motor causes rotation of the rotation shaft, and accordingly integral rotation of the impellers that allow compressing the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air circulating through same. Furthermore, another important aspect is based on the fact that the fermentation vat additionally comprises a programmable logic controller, preferably with a touch screen, that allows enologists or winemakers to perform complete and thorough control and follow-up of the different phases of the method for fermenting. More specifically, said logic controller allows adjusting and programming the soaking and mixing times, the soaking (cap wetting) time always being less than the mixing (cap breaking) time. It has even been envisaged for said programmable logic controller to be configured to allow remote control of several fermentation vats with different volumetric capacities, thereby providing a versatile character that can be adapted to each winery or situation. Description of the Drawings To complement the description being made and for the purpose of helping to better understand the features of the invention according to a preferred practical embodiment thereof, a set of drawings is attached as an integral part of said description in which the following has been depicted with an illustrative and non-limiting character: Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the must fermentation vat object of invention.Figure 2 shows a detail view of a diffuser nozzle according to another preferred embodiment.Figure 3 shows a plan view of the diffuser nozzle of Figure 2 according to axis A-A'.Figure 4 shows a schematic view of the internal components of the compressor shown in Figure 1. Preferred Embodiment of the Invention A preferred embodiment is described below in reference to the aforementioned drawings, without this limiting or reducing the scope of protection of the present invention. Figure 1 shows a must fermentation vat (1), which comprises: at least one suction filter (4) for suctioning CO2 gas, said suction filter (4) being located in the fermentation vat (1) in an intermediate position between a layer (3) of skins intended for being created on the surface of the must and the top opening of said fermentation vat (1),at least one aeration valve (5) that allows regulating the amount of outside air to be introduced into the fermentation vat (1),a compressor (6) for mixing and propelling the CO2 gas suctioned through the suction filter (4) and the outside air coming from the aeration valve (5),at least one injection conduit (7) that is connected to the compressor (6) and allows introducing the mixture of CO2 gas and air inside the fermentation vat (1),at least one diffuser nozzle (8), connected to the injection conduit (7), and provided with outlet jets (9) for expelling, in the form of bubbles (10), the mixture of CO2 gas and air inside the fermentation vat (1); anda programmable logic controller (50) PLC with a touch screen that allows controlling the different phases of the method for fermenting, and specifically the programming of the operating times of each of the soaking and mixing phases, as well as the stop and break times between said phases, preventing human errors and maximizing efficiency, yield and therefore qualities of the final wine produced. On the other hand, Figure 4 shows that the compressor (6) of the present embodiment basically consists of two centrifugal pumps (20A, 20B), where each of them provides a rotational speed of 22,500 rpm and comprises a leak-tight inner chamber (21) with its corresponding inlet (E1, E2) and outlet (S1, S2) for circulation of the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air coming from the suction filter (4) and the aeration valve (5), respectively. Furthermore, the compressor (6) comprises a manifold (30) connecting the outlet (S1) of the first centrifugal pump (20A) with the inlet (E2) of the second centrifugal pump (20B) for serial flow of said mixture of CO2 gas and outside air. Therefore, although Figure 4 shows that the centrifugal pumps (20A, 20B) are physically arranged in parallel in the compressor (6), for greater robustness and smaller sizing of the compressor (6), the flow of the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air through them is a serial flow. Therefore, in an operating state, the first centrifugal pump (20A) initially suctions and compresses the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air, producing said mixture at its outlet (S1) at a certain pressure P1. This mixture of CO2 gas and outside air is redirected through the manifold (30) towards the inlet (E2) of the second centrifugal pump (20B), which suctions and compresses the mixture to pressure P2, where P2 is always greater than P1. Finally, the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air is propelled at outlet pressure P2 from the second centrifugal pump (20B) inside the fermentation vat (1) through the injection conduit (7), thereby achieving complete and efficient movement of all the must contained in the reservoir (2) of the vat, increasing the transfer between the layer (3) of skins of the cap and the must, and hence maximizing quality of the wine. By means of this special serial arrangement of the centrifugal pumps (20A, 20B) pressure of the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air at the outlet of the compressor (6) is substantially increased, obtaining values of 0.5 bar of pressure with the use of two pumps (20A, 20B), which allows suitably propelling and injecting said mixture with a flow rate of 3,500 l/min in the must housed in the reservoir (2) of the vat. This flow rate allows producing a movement of the must exceeding 10,000 l/min, which makes it suitable for large capacity reservoirs (of up to about 175,000 liters) having a height of up to 11 meters, and where it has been demonstrated that to produce optimal soaking and mixing of the content of the must and the "cap", injecting the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air at about half the height is sufficient, injecting the mixture at a depth of 5 meters in this case. Nevertheless, it has been envisaged that even 0.75 bar of pressure can be achieved by means of using three centrifugal pumps, such as those herein described. More particularly, the schematic view of Figure 4 shows that the centrifugal pumps (20A, 20B) comprise an internal electric motor (25) with its corresponding rotation shaft (26), and where the inner chambers (21) in turn comprise at least one impeller (22) fixed integrally to the rotation shaft (26) of the electric motor (25) for compressing the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air. Therefore, the rotational movement of the rotation shaft (26) of the electric motor (25) causes the integral rotation of the impellers (22), which are the elements responsible for performing compression, by centrifugal force, of the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air circulating through same. According to the present embodiment, both the rotation shafts (26) of the electric motors (25) and the impellers (22) are made of stainless steel, being furthermore impregnated with epoxy resin for their protection against corrosion and electrical insulation, making them suitable for their direct contact with the mixture of CO2 gas and outside air, as well as for obtaining the relevant health authorizations and homologations, preventing use of contaminating oils or greases. It has more preferably been envisaged for the electric motors (25) to be able to comprise thermal protection means (27) that allow interrupting their operation in the event of overheating and which preferably comprise a thermal relay. It has also been envisaged for the pumps herein described to have a protective fireproof and vibration-absorbing casing, preferably being made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). According to a second preferred embodiment shown in Figures 2 and 3, the diffuser nozzle (8) of the fermentation vat (1) is a rotary nozzle. Said rotary diffuser nozzle (8) even more preferably comprises an elongated discharge body having bends (12) at its distal ends and a central stretch (11) having a larger section than said bends (12), which in addition to providing the assembly with robustness, favors uniform distribution of the bubbles (10) intended for being expelled through the outlet jets (9) throughout the entire fermentation vat (1). This accordingly causes a more complete and homogenous movement of the entire layer (3) of skins. Therefore, by means of the method for fermenting and fermentation vat herein described homogenous and continuous movement of the layer (3) of skins is produced for a rapid and efficient fermentation, the primary advantages of which are: extraction of the content from the layer of skins is maximized,oxygenation or aeration of the must to be fermented is allowed,pH level and redox potential are controlled,use of hydraulic pumps is prevented, which allows reducing economic costs,they are useful and can be applied both in tumultuous fermentation and in malo-lactic fermentation,the fermentation vat is self-sufficient as regards CO2 gas, not requiring additional reservoirs storing the gas,the phase of rack-and-return does not need to be performed,micro-oxygenation does not need to be performed,it is ecological, preventing use of external CO2 for mixing the must,it is economical, reducing power consumption by more than 50%,it is efficient, allowing reducing the pumping over work hours by at least half.
