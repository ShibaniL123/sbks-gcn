The type of pharmaceutical formulation of the first and second active ingredient of a kit-of-parts according to this invention can be similar, i.e. both ingredients are formulated in separate tablets or capsules, or can be different, i.e. suited for different administration forms, such as e.g. one active ingredient is formulated as tablet or capsule and the other is formulated for e.g. intravenous administration. The amounts of the first and second active ingredients of the combinations, compositions or kits according to this invention may together comprise a therapeutically effective amount, particularly for the treatment and/or prevention of the diseases, disorders and conditions mentioned above. General Synthesis The compounds according to the invention may be obtained using methods of synthesis known in principle. Preferably the compounds are obtained by the following methods according to the invention which are described in more detail hereinafter. The synthesis of compounds of formula I, wherein R1-R7 are defined as hereinbefore, R8 denotes hydrogen, can be carried out according to the invention related process a) shown in scheme 1. In the first step of this route ketoesters of formula XI, wherein Ra denotes methyl or ethyl, in a suitable solvent such as e.g. methanol or ethanol are deprotonated with a suitable base such as e.g. sodium ethoxide or sodium methoxide and treated with epoxides of formula XII at temparatures between −10° C. and 80° C. to give ketolactones X. Ketolactones X are oxidized to furanones IX with a suitable oxidizing reagent such as e.g. 2-iodoxybenzoic acid and 4-methoxypyridine-N-oxide in a suitable solvent such as e.g. dimethylsulfoxide at temperatures between 0° C. and 50° C. Furanones of formula IX are condensed with enaminoketones of formula VIII, e.g. at temperatures between 150° C. and 250° C. either neat under reduced pressure at or at temperatures between 100° C. and 150° C. in a suitable solvent such as e.g. acetic acid yielding the tricyclic dihydropyridines of formula VII. Dihydropyridines VII are oxidized to the corresponding tricyclic pyridines of formula VI using a suitable oxidizing reagent such as e.g. 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) in a suitable solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane at temperatures between 0° C. and 50° C. Reduction of the ketogroup in tricyclic pyridines of formula VI is carried out with a suitable hydride donating reagent such as e.g. borane-tetrahydrofurane-complex, borane-dimethylsulfide-complex, borane-dimethylaniline-complex, borane-diethylaniline-complex, sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride in a suitable solvent such as e.g. diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane or toluene, at temperatures between −78° C. and 100° C., but preferably between −50° C. and 80° C., optionally in the presence of a chiral ligand as for example (1R,2S)-(+)-cis-1-Amino-2-indanol, (1S,2R)-(−)-cis-1-Amino-2-indanol, (R)-1-Methyl-3,3-diphenyl-tetrahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-c][1,3,2]oxazaborole or (S)-1-Methyl-3,3-diphenyl-tetrahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-c][1,3,2]oxazaborole gives the alcohols of formula V, wherein R5 denotes hydrogen. The reduction in the presence of chiral ligands results in enantiomerically enriched compounds of formula V. For example the reduction with borane reagents such as e.g. borane-tetrahydrofurane-complex, borane-dimethylsulfide-complex, borane-dimethylaniline-complex or borane-diethylaniline-complex each in the presence of (1R,2S)-(+)-cis-1-Amino-2-indanole gives compounds of formula V with S-configuration at the newly formed stereocenter as it is known from the literature (see Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1995, 6, 301-306; Synthesis 1998, 937-961 or Angew. Chem. 1999, 111, 3574-3576). Likewise, alkylation reaction of compounds of formula V with a suitable alkyl metal compound, such as e.g. 1-4C-dialkylzinc-, 1-4C-alkylmagnesium halogenide-, or 1-4C-alkyllithium-reagent, particularly 1-2C-dialkylzinc-, 1-2C-alkylmagnesium halogenide-, or 1-2C-alkyllithium-reagent, in a suitable solvent such as e.g. n-hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, diethylether, tetrahydrofurane or 1,4-dioxane, optionally in the presence of a chiral ligand such as for example (R)-1-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-tetrahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-c][1,3,2]oxazaborole, (R)-1-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-tetrahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-c][1,3,2]oxazaborole, (−)-3-exo-dimethylamino-isoborneol, (+)-3-exo-dimethylamino-isoborneol or ligands as described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 10970-10971 or Tetrahedron 1998, 54, 5651-5666, at temperatures between −50° C. and 100° C., but preferably between −20° C. and 70° C., gives the corresponding compounds of formula V, wherein R5 denotes 1-4C-alkyl, particularly 1-2C-alkyl. The alcohol group in compounds of formula V can be temporarily protected with a suitable protecting group, e.g. as a tert.-butyldimethylsilylether by the reaction with tert.-butyldimethylsilylchloride in a solvent such as e.g. dimethylformamide or acetonitrile in the presence of imidazole, at temperatures between −20° C. and 120° C., but preferably between 0° C. and 80° C., to give the protected derivatives of formula IV, in which PG stands for this suitable protecting group. This protection can also be carried out by reacting compounds of formula V with tert.-butyldimethylsilyl-trifluormethansulfonat in the presence of a base such as e.g. pyridine or 2,6-lutidine in a solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane, diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane or toluene, at temperatures between −50° C. and 100° C. but preferably between −30° C. and 50° C. Alternatively any other suitable protecting group as described e.g. in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, 2nd edition, Greene T. W., Wuts P. G. M.; Wiley-Interscience: New York, 1991 or in “Protective Groups”, Kocienski P. J.; Thieme: New York, 1994 can be used. Lactones of formula IV are transformed into lactols of formula III by reaction with a suitable R1-metal reagent, such as e.g. R1-magnesium halogenide- or R1-lithium-reagent, in an aprotic solvent such as e.g. diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane or toluene, at temperatures between −78° C. and room temperature for lithium reagents or between −50° C. and room temperature for magnesium reagents. The lactols of formula III are reduced to the corresponding compounds of formula II using a combination of a suitable acid such as e.g. titaniumtetrachloride or borontrifluoride etherate with a suitable hydride donating reagent such as e.g. sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, but preferably with sodium triacetoxyborohydride, in a suitable solvent such as e.g. diethylether, dichloromethane, toluene or tetrahydrofurane, but preferably tetrahydrofurane, at temperatures between −50° C. and room temperature. The reduction under preferred conditions results in diastereomerically enriched compounds of formula II. For example the reduction with borane reagents such as e.g. sodium triacetoxyborohydride in the presence of titaniumtetrachloride gives compounds of formula II, in which the newly formed stereocenter has preferably R-configuration as proven by extensive NMR analysis. Deprotection of compounds of formula II, wherein PG denotes tert.-butyldimethylsilyl, preferably with a fluoride reagent such as e.g. tetrabutylammonium fluoride or caesium fluoride or with an acid such as e.g. for example trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid in a suitable solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile or toluene, at temperatures between −50° C. and 120° C., but preferably between −20° C. and 80° C. gives compounds of formula I. Alternatively any other protecting group introduced before can be cleaved by suitable methods as described in the literature e.g. in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, 2nd edition, Greene T. W., Wuts P. G. M.; Wiley-Interscience: New York, 1991 or in “Protective Groups”, Kocienski P. J.; Thieme: New York, 1994. Compounds of formula II can also be transformed into compounds of formula I, wherein R8 denotes acetoxy, propionyloxy or hydroxy, according to invention related process b) shown in scheme 2. The synthesis of compounds of formula I, wherein R1-R7 are defined as hereinbefore, R8 denotes acetoxy, propionyloxy or hydroxy, can be carried out according to the invention related process b) shown in scheme 2, wherein PG denotes a suitable protecting group, starting from compounds of formula XIII, which equal compounds II in which R8 denotes hydrogen. First step is the formation of N-oxides of formula XIV. This reaction is performed by treating compounds of formula XIII with a suitable oxidizing reagent, such as e.g. meta-chloro-perbenzoic acid (MCPBA), in a suitable solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform or tetrachloromethane, at temperatures between −10° C. and 60° C. Compounds of formula XIV are then reacted with acetic acid anhydride or propionic acid anhydride at temperatures between 90° C. and 180° C. to deliver compounds of formula II, wherein R8 denotes acetoxy or propionyloxy. Deprotection of compounds of formula II, wherein PG denotes tert.-butyldimethylsilyl, preferably with a fluoride reagent such as e.g. tetrabutylammonium fluoride or caesium fluoride or with an acid such as e.g. trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid in a suitable solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile or toluene, or methanol or water, or mixtures thereof, at temperatures between −50° C. and 120° C., but preferably between −20° C. and 80° C., gives compounds of formula I, wherein R8 denotes acetoxy or propionyloxy. Alternatively any other protecting group introduced before can be cleaved by suitable methods as described in the literature e.g. in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, 2nd edition, Greene T. W., Wuts P. G. M.; Wiley-Interscience: New York, 1991 or in “Protective Groups”, Kocienski P. J.; Thieme: New York, 1994. Treating compounds of formula I, wherein R8 denotes acetoxy or propionyloxy, with a suitable base such as e.g. sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, caesium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as e.g. methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofurane, water or in a mixture of water and methanol or ethanol, at temperatures between 0° C. and 80° C., delivers compounds of formula I, wherein R8 denotes hydroxy. Alternatively these compounds of formula II, wherein the −OPG group and the R8 residue are cis configured, can be treated with a suitable base such as e.g. sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, caesium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in a suitable solvent like methanol, ethanol or water or in a mixture of water and methanol or ethanol, at temperatures between 0° C. and 80° C., to deliver directly compounds of formula I, wherein R8 denotes hydroxy. Starting compounds of formulae VIII, XI, XII are known or can be obtained analogously or similarly to known procedures. Compounds of formula VIII can for example be prepared from their corresponding cyclohexan-1,3-diones analogous as described in Synthesis 1983, 902-903. The cyclohexandiones can be prepared analogous to the described procedure in Angew. Chem. 1999, 111, 3574-3576. Besides the strategies presented a host of additional approaches can be envisaged. Therefore, the preceding strategies are in no way meant to restrict the possible synthetic pathways to access the compounds of the invention but are only supposed to show a few routes by way of example. Besides the hereinbefore described methods for the synthesis of compounds of formula I, additional functional group transformations, which are known to the person skilled in the art, at any stage of the synthesis can be envisaged, if these transformations are compatible to other functional groups and if the so installed functional groups are stable to subsequent transformations in the synthesis. For example aromatic hydroxy groups can be converted into aromatic sulfonyloxy groups such as methylsulfonyloxy, tosylsulfonyloxy or trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy. This transformation is performed by reacting compounds with aromatic hydroxy group with a sulfonyl anhydride, sulfonylchloride or sulfonylimide in a solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile or toluene at temperatures between −78° C. and 40° C., in the presence of a base such as e.g. triethylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-N-ethyl-amine, pyridine or 2,6-lutidine, optionally in the presence of an acylation catalyst as 4-dimethylamino-pyridine (DMAP). These aromatic sulfonyloxy groups can be further transformed into alkenyl groups or optionally substituted cyclopropyl groups by reacting the compounds with aromatic sulfonyloxy groups with potassium alkenyltrifluoroborates, alkenyl-boronic acids, alkenyl-boronic acid pinacol esters, optionally substituted cyclopropyl-boronic acids or optionally substituted cyclopropyl-boronic acid pinacol esters in toluene, N,N-dimethylformamide, isopropanol, acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane or tetrahydrofurane or mixtures of toluene and tetrahydrofurane in the presence of a base as such as e.g. aqueous sodium carbonate, aqueous potassium carbonate, aqueous caesium carbonate, silver carbonate, caesium fluoride, triethylamine or N,N-diisopropyl-N-ethyl-amine and in the presence of a catalyst such as e.g. tetrakis-triphenylphosphine-palladium-(0), bis-tri-tert.-butylphosphine-palladium-(0), 1,1′-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene-dichloro-palladium-(II) or bis-[1,2-bis-(diphenylphosphino)-ethane]-palladium-(0), or in the presence of a palladium source such as e.g. palladium diacetate or tris-(dibenzylideneacetone)-dipalladium-(0) and a suitable ligand like e.g. tri-tert.-butylphosphine, tri-cyclohexylphosphine, di-adamantan-1-yl-butylphosphine, 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2′,6′-diisopropoxy-1,1′biphenyl, 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2′,4′,6′-triisopropyl-1,1′-biphenyl or 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2′,6′-dimethoxy-1,1′-biphenyl at temperatures between 0° C. and 180° C., but preferably between room temperature and 120° C. Alkenyl groups can be transformed into an optionally substituted cyclopropyl group by a Simmons-Smith reaction. This reaction is performed by reacting with bromo-iodo-methane or diiodomethane and diethylzinc, optionally in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, in a solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane or toluene at temperatures between −50° C. and 80° C., but preferably between −10° C. and room temperature. Alkoxycarbonyl groups can be transformed into dialkylmethanol groups. This transformation is performed by reacting with an alkyllithium reagent or with an alkyl-Grignard reagent in a solvent such as e.g. diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane or toluene at temperatures between −50° C. and 80° C., but preferably between −20° C. and room temperature. Alternatively alkoxycarbonyl groups, can be transformed into compounds hydroxymethyl groups. This transformation is performed by reacting with a reducing reagent such as e.g. lithiumaluminium hydride in a solvent like diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane or toluene at temperatures between −50° C. and 80° C., but preferably between −20° C. and 40° C. Hydroxy groups can be further transformed into alkoxy groups by alkylation. This transformation is performed by reacting with an alkylating agent such as e.g. an alkyl halogenide, methanesulfonic acid-alkyl-ester, p-toluenesulfonic acid-alkyl-ester or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid-alkyl-ester in the presence of a base such as e.g. sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium hexamethyldisilazide or potassium hexamethyldisilazide in a solvent such as e.g. diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile or toluene at temperatures between −50° C. and 80° C., but preferably between −20° C. and 50° C. It is moreover known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” by T. Greene and P. Wuts (John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1999, 3rd Ed.) or in “Protecting Groups (Thieme Foundations Organic Chemistry Series N Group” by P. Kocienski (Thieme Medical Publishers, 2000). In the reactions described hereinbefore, any reactive groups present such as carboxy-, carbonyl-, hydroxy-, amino-, alkylamino- or imino-groups may be protected during the reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the reaction. For example, a protecting group for a carboxy group may be the methyl-, ethyl-, tert.-butyl- or benzyl-group. For example, a protecting group for a carbonyl group may be an acetal or ketal like the 1,3-dioxolane- or the 1,3-dioxane-group. For example, a protecting group for a hydroxy group may be a trimethylsilyl-, tert.-butyldimethylsilyl-, acetyl-, trityl-, benzyl- or tetrahydropyranyl-group. Protecting groups for an amino, alkylamino or imino group may be, for example, a formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert.butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group. The cleavage of a carboxymethyl- or a carboxyethyl-group can for example be carried out hydrolytically in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, methanol/water, isopropanol/water, acetic acid/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or 1,4-dioxane/water, in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or in the presence of an alkali base as for example lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, but preferably sodium hydroxide, or aprotically in the presence of e.g. iodotrimethylsilane, at temperatures between 0 and 120° C., preferably at temperatures between 10 and 100° C. An acetal or ketal can be cleaved with acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid or pyridiumium-p-toluene sulfonate in mixtures with water or in organic solvents like for example dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane, toluene or acetone at temperatures between −20° C. and 150° C., but preferably between 0° C. and 120° C. A benzyl, methoxybenzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group is advantageously cleaved hydrogenolytically, e.g. with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium/charcoal in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetatetetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane or glacial acetic acid, optionally with the addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid or with the addition of a base such as triethylamine at temperatures between 0 and 100° C., but preferably at ambient temperatures between 20 and 60° C., and at a hydrogen pressure of 1 to 7 bar, but preferably 3 to 5 bar. A 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group, however, is preferably cleaved in trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of anisole. A tert.butyl or tert.butyloxycarbonyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid or by treating with iodotrimethylsilane optionally using a solvent such as dichloromethane, 1,4-dioxane, methanol or diethylether. A trimethylsilyl- or tert.-butyldimethylsilyl-group is cleaved with a fluoride reagent like for example tetrabutylammonium fluoride or caesium fluoride or with an acid like for example trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid in a solvent like e.g. dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, diethylether, tetrahydrofurane, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile or toluene at temperatures between −50° C. and 120° C., but preferably between −20° C. and 80° C. The present invention also relates to intermediates (including their salts, stereoisomers and salts of these stereoisomers), methods and processes which are disclosed herein and which are useful in synthesizing final compounds according to this invention. Thus, the present invention also relates to processes disclosed herein for preparing compounds according to this invention, which processes may be performed as described herein. Said processes may comprise one or more steps of converting and/or reacting the mentioned intermediates with the appropriate reaction partners, suitably under conditions as disclosed herein. Moreover, the compounds of general formula I or intermediates in the synthesis of compounds of general formula I obtained may be resolved into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers, as mentioned hereinbefore. Thus, for example, cis/trans mixtures may be resolved into their cis and trans isomers, and racemic compounds may be separated into their enantiomers. Thus, for example, the cis/trans mixtures may be resolved by chromatography into the cis and trans isomers thereof. The compounds of general formula I or intermediates in the synthesis of compounds of general formula I, which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se (cf. Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in “Topics in Stereochemistry”, Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their optical antipodes and compounds of general formula I or intermediates in the synthesis of compounds of general formula I with at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastereomers on the basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se, e.g. by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation, and, if these compounds are obtained in racemic form, they may subsequently be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned above. The racemates are preferably resolved by column chromatography on chiral phases or by crystallization from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as esters or amides with the racemic compound. Salts may be formed with enantiomerically pure acids for basic compounds and with enantiomerically pure bases for acidic compounds. Diastereomeric derivatives are formed with enantiomerically pure auxiliary compounds, e.g. acids, their activated derivatives, or alcohols. Separation of the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained may be achieved by taking advantage of their different physico-chemical properties, e.g. differences in solubility; the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids in common use for such a purpose are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, ditoloyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or quinic acid. Optically active alcohols applicable as auxiliary residues may be, for example, (+) or (−)-menthol and optically active acyl groups in amides may be, for example, (+)- or (−)-menthyloxycarbonyl. Moreover, the compounds of formula I may be converted into the salts thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the pharmaceutically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid. Corresponding processes are known for the skilled person. When one of the final steps (e.g. removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor) or purification is carried out under the presence of an inorganic or organic acid (e.g. hydrochloric, trifluoroacetic, acetic or formic acid or the like) or a base, the compounds of formula I may be obtained—depending on their individual chemical nature and the individual nature of the acid or base used—as free compound or containing said acid or base in an stoechiometric or non-stoechiometric quantity (e.g. as a salt). The acid/base contained can be analyzed according to art-known procedures, e.g. by titration or NMR, and, optionally, removed according to procedures familiar to the skilled person. Optionally, salts of the compounds of the formula I may be converted into the free compounds. Corresponding processes are known to the skilled person, e.g. via neutralization. Salts can be obtained by combining or reacting the free compounds with the desired acids or bases, e.g. by dissolving or suspending the free compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. a ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone, an ether, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, a low-molecular-weight aliphatic alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, or an ester, such as ethyl acetate, or water, or a mixture thereof) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added. The salts can be obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a nonsolvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted to another, e.g. by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchanger. Likewise, salts obtained can be converted into the free compounds, which can in turn be converted into salts, by alkalization or by acidification. In this manner, pharmaceutically unacceptable salts can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The substances according to the invention are isolated and purified in a manner known per se, for example by distilling off the solvent under reduced pressure and recrystallizing the residue obtained from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as, for example, column chromatography on a suitable support material. The compounds according to the invention are advantageously obtainable using the methods described in the examples that follow, which may also be combined for this purpose with methods known to the skilled person from his/her expert knowledge. Likewise, further compounds according to this invention, whose preparation are not explicitly described in the following examples, can be prepared analogously or similarly to the examples. Any or all of the compounds according to the present invention which are mentioned as final compounds in the following examples, including the salts, stereoisomers and salts of the stereoisomers thereof, are a particularly interesting subject within the present invention. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following examples. The following examples serve to illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention without restricting it.
