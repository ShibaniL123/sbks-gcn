Synthesis of 4-chloro-N-{2-hydroxy-1-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]ethyl}benzamide (Compound 78)
(78-1) Synthesis of 2-[(4-chlorophenyl)formamide]-3-hydroxypropionic acid (Compound 78-1)
Water (100 mL) was added to DL-serine (10g, 95 mmol) and potassium carbonate (13.2 g, 95 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, then a THF (20 mL) solution of 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride (12.2 mL, 95 mmol) was added dropwise over 30 minutes, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, the aqueous layer was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and stirred at 0 Â°C to precipitate crystals. The obtained crystals were collected by filtration and washed with water to obtain the title compound (15.4 g, yield 67%).
