Description of Embodiments The present invention is explained in detail below. In the present invention, the "metabolism improvement" means that the metabolism of lipid and/or sugar and/or energy are/is improved. Specifically, for example, lipid metabolism improvement means promotion of the decomposition of lipid present in the body tissue, blood, or lymph tissue, suppression of lipid synthesis, prevention and/or suppression of accumulation of lipid in body tissues such as adipose tissue and the like, or reduction of lipid accumulated in body tissue and the like. The "lipid" is triglyceride and/or cholesterol, including fatty acid. The improvement of sugar metabolism means suppression of an increase in sugar, and/or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) present in blood, fasting blood sugar level, or promotion of sugar metabolism after eating. Furthermore, sugar metabolism improvement also includes improvement of impaired glucose tolerance (pathology not included in normal type or diabetes type, and pre-diabetic). The "sugar" refers to monosaccharide, disaccharide or polysaccharide. The improvement of energy metabolism means bringing the state of abnormal balance of ingested energy level and release energy level, or the state of unattainable control of the balance of ingested energy level and release energy level, to a normal state or closer to a normal state. As an index of the aforementioned metabolism improvement, PPAR activity can be measured. It is known that PPAR includes at least 3 kinds of subtypes: PPARα, PPARδ (same as β) and PPARγ. PPARα is mainly expressed in the liver, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, brown adipocyte and the like, and is involved in control of many genes relating to β oxidation of fatty acid. PPARδ is expressed in comparatively all over the body (brain, adipose tissue, skin etc.). PPARγ has at least 3 kinds of' isoforms, is mainly expressed in white adipocyte and macrophage, and is involved in adipocyte differentiation and the like. When the presence or absence of a ligand (agonist, antagonist) activity is confirmed for at least one kind of these PPARs and an agonist activity is found, it is judged that the possibility of having a metabolism improving effect is high, or a metabolism improving effect is present. As one example, the PPAR reporter assay described in FEBS Letters 514 (2002) p.315-322 can be performed. However, the method is not limited thereto. Alternatively, oxo fatty acid and the like may be administered to obesity or diabetes animal model, body weight, organ weight, blood glucose level, neutral fats value, oxygen consumption level, rectal temperature and the like are measured, and the presence or absence of the changes thereof can be confirmed. The obesity or diabetes animal model is not limited as long as it is an animal showing the properties. For example, as the aforementioned animal model, commercially available KKAy mouse, NOD mouse, NSY mouse, TSOD mouse, ZDF/Crl-Leprfa rat, SDT/Jcl rat and the like can be recited. The body weight, organ weight, blood glucose level, neutral fats value, oxygen consumption level, rectal temperature and the like can be measured by a known method. Using these as indices, when a decrease in the body weight or organ weight, or blood glucose level, neutral fats value is observed, or when an increase in the oxygen consumption level or rectal temperature is observed, it is judged that the possibility of having a metabolism improving effect is high, or a metabolism improving effect is present. Alternatively, as described in the below-mentioned Examples, whether a lipid synthesis-promoting action induced by LXR agonist is suppressed by the addition of oxo fatty acid and the like can be confirmed. As a method therefor, for example, Journal of Lipid Research 47 (2006) 2712-2717 can be referred to, but the method is not limited thereto. The method described in the aforementioned document includes adding a LXR agonist, and (1) measuring the expression level of mRNA and/or protein of lipid synthesis-related factors, for example, SREBP-1c, mature and immature SREBP-1, SCD-1, FAS, ACC1 and/or ACC2, (2) measuring an intracellular triacylglycerol level, or (3) performing luciferase assay using LXR responsive sequence. Examples of the LXR agonist include, but are not limited to, T0901317, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and the like. When the expression level and the like of mRNA and/or protein of lipid synthesis-related factor decreases, it is judged that the lipid synthesis is suppressed, and the possibility of having a metabolism improving effect is high, or a metabolism improving effect is present.

The present invention is explained in more detail in the following by referring to Examples. The Examples are mere exemplifications of the present invention and do not limit the scope of the present invention in any manner. Examples The rare fatty acids such as KetoA, HYA, γHYA, γKetoA, rHYA and the like used in the present invention were prepared based on the above-mentioned method (the method described in Japanese patent application No. 2012-108928). KetoRA was prepared from ricinoleic acid (RA)' based on the above-mentioned method. GW7647 (PPARα agonist), Troglitazone (PPARγ agonist) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, T0901317 (LXR agonist) was purchased from Cayman Chemical, RA was purchased from NU-CHEK PREP, INC. (USA) (product number:U-50-A), EPA was purchased from NU-CHEK PREP, INC. (USA) (product number:U-99-A), LA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (product number:L1376), and other reagents were purchased from Mako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. or Nacalai Tesque and the like. [Example 1] Measurement of PPARα, γ ligand activity To evaluate the function of oxo fatty acid and the like, PPARα, γ-activating action was measured first. The measurement was performed in reference to Nobuyuki Takahashi et al., FEBS Letters 514 (2002) p.315-322, "Dual action of isoprenols from herbal medicines on both PPARgamma and PPARalpha in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and HepG2 hepatocytes.", the section of Materials and Methods "Reporter plasmids and luciferase assays". To be specific, a plasmid containing DNA encoding a fused protein of PPARα, γ ligand binding region and GAL4 DNA binding region (pM-hPPARα or pM-hPPARγ), a reporter plasmid containing GAL4 binding DNA sequence linked to luciferase (p4xUASg-tk-luc), and internal control (pRL-CMV) to standardize transfection efficiency were introduced into CV-1 cell derived from the kidney of African green monkey. The ligand described below was added to the cells and, after incubation for 24 hr, luciferase activity was measured. As a ligand, KetoA and HYA were each added at 30 µM. The concentration of the sample was adjusted with ethanol. Ethanol was used as a negative control, PPARα was used as a positive control, and GW7647 (10 nM) and Troglitazone (5 µM) were used as γ agonists. The results are shown in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1, strong PPARα and γ agonist activity was found in KetoA, and PPARα agonist activity and some PPARγ agonist activity were found in HYA. By a similar method, luciferase activity was also measured for αKetoA, γKetoA, sKetoA, KetoB, γKetoB, αKetoB, sKetoB, rKetoB, KetoC, γKetoC, αKetoC, sKetoC, KetoRA, αHYA, γHYA, sHYA, rHYA, HYB, αHYB, γHYB, sHYB, rHYB, RA, HYC, αHYC, γHYC and sHYC. As a result, KetoC, αKetoC, KetoRA and γKetoC showed PPARα and γ agonist activity, HYB, KetoB, αHYA, γHYA, rHYB, RA, rKetoB and rHYA showed PPARα agonist activity, and αKetoA and γKetoA showed PPARγ agonist activity. [Example 2] Effect in obesity or diabetes model mouse (1) Using KKAy mouse as obesity or diabetes model mouse, the effect of KetoA, HYA was evaluated. KKAy mice (KKAy/TaJcl, male, 4-week-old, purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. and individually bred) were preliminarily bred on a commercially available normal diet (ND) for 1 week, divided into 5 groups, and each group was bred on a high-fat diet (HFD) as a basic feed and given a non-addition feed (control group), or a feed added with different amounts of KetoA and HYA for 4 weeks. The KetoA, HYA-added feed was prepared by adding KetoA, HYA to HFD such that the amount to be added was 0.05% (w/w) (0.05% group) or 0.1%(w/w) (0.1% group). (2) The profile of the body weight and blood glucose level of the KKAy mouse was measured. After the start of the test feed breeding, the oxygen consumption level was measured on day 16 - 19, an oral glucose loading test was performed on day 24, and the rectal temperature was measured on day 26. The next day of the completion of experimental breeding, the KKAy mouse was dissected, and the organ weight and plasma neutral fat level were measured. (3) The profile of the body weight of KKAy mouse is shown in Fig. 2. In the KetoA-added feed group, a body weight increase suppression tendency was found in the 0.05% group, and significant suppression of body weight increase was found in the 0.1% group. In the HYA-added feed group, significant suppression of body weight increase was found in the 0.05% group. In the Figure, * shows P<0.05, and ** shows P<0.01 (hereinafter the same for Figs. 3 - 7). The profile of the blood glucose level of KKAy mouse is shown in Fig. 3. At 4 weeks of the test diet ingestion, a tendency toward suppression of blood glucose increase was found in the 0.05% KetoA group as compared to the control group. Furthermore, a stronger, significant hypoglycemic action was found in the 0.1% KetoA group. On the other hand, the HYA group showed a tendency toward suppression of blood glucose level increase even though a significant difference was not found. The oxygen consumption level of the KKAy mouse is shown in Fig. 4. In addition, the results of rectal temperature of KKAy mouse are shown in Fig. 5. As compared to the control group, an increase in the oxygen consumption level was found in the KetoA group, and an increase in the rectal temperature was also found. The results show that heat generation is promoted in the KetoA group. The results of the organ weight (intraperitoneal white fat weight) of the KKAy mouse are shown in Fig. 6, and the results of plasma neutral fats are shown in Fig. 7. A significant decrease in both the intraperitoneal white fat weight and plasma neutral fat level was confirmed in the 0.1% KetoA group. (4) From the above results, metabolism abnormality associated with obesity was improved in the KetoA ingestion group. Since an increase in the oxygen consumption level and elevation of rectal temperature were found, promoted heat generation is considered to contribute to the improvement of metabolism abnormality by KetoA. [Example 3] Effect on induction of fatty acid synthesis by LXR agonist Using human liver cancer-derived HepG2 cells (cell No.; JCRB1054, the Health Science Research Resources Bank), a suppressive effect on fatty acid synthesis promotion induced by LXR agonist was evaluated by reference to the method of Zaima et al. (Journal of Lipid Research 47, 2712-2717, 2006). HepG2 cells (2.0x105 cells/mL) were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS for 24 hr, and the medium was exchanged with 0.1% BSA-containing DMEM medium containing 10 nM LXR agonist T0901317 (Cayman Chemicals) and 60 µM various fatty acid. After culture for 24 hr, the cells were recovered, and total RNA was extracted using Sepasol reagent (Nacalai Tesque). After DNase treatment, reverse transcription was performed using SuperScriptII (Invitrogen) to give a cDNA solution. Using SYBR Green Mix (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and gene-specific primer (Table 1), real-time PCR was performed as follows.

Reaction at 96°C, 15 min, 2. reaction at 96°C, 15 sec, 3. reaction at 60°C for 30 sec, 4. measurement of fluorescence, 5. 2 - 4 were repeated 40 times, 6. the melting curve was measured from 65°C to 95°C at 0.4°C intervals. As the internal standard, 18S rRNA was used. The genes involved in the fatty acid synthesis as measured were Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), Stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD-1), Fatty acid synthase (FAS), and Acetyl CoA carboxylase-1 and -2 (ACC-1, 2). As for the amount of accumulated intracellular TG, the lipid was extracted with chloroform-methanol, and quantified by triglyceride-E Test Wako (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). In addition, the protein expression level of immature and mature SREBP-1c was measured. Cells treated as mentioned above were dispersed in buffer A (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES-KOH, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA-Na, 1 mM EGTA-Na, pH 7.6) containing a protease inhibitor, passed 20 times through a 23 gauge injection needle, and centrifuged (1,000xg, 4°C, 5 min) to separate into supernatant 1 and precipitate 1. The precipitate 1 was re-dissolved in buffer B (20 mM HEPES-KOH, 0.42 M NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA-Na, 1 mM EGTA-Na, pH 7.6), and centrifuged (105xg, 4°C, 15 min). The obtained supernatant 2 was used as a nuclear fraction (including mature form). The supernatant 1 was further centrifuged (105xg, 4°C, 15 min), and the obtained precipitate 2 was dissolved in cell lysate (10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA-Na, 1 mM EGTA-Na) and used as a membrane fraction (including immature form). Using these as samples, measurement was performed by Western blot method using anti-SREBP-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Using Dual luciferase system (Promega), antagonizing action on LXR was evaluated by luciferase assay. p3xIR1-tk-Luc, pCMX-hLXRa, pRL-CMX were introduced into HepG2 cell. After culture in a 0.1% BSA-containing serum-free medium containing various fatty acids and T0901317 for 24 hr, the luciferase activity was measured. Fig. 8 shows variation of expression of SREBP-1c mRNA. T0901317 increased the expression to about 7-fold, but a strong suppressive action was found in HYA and KetoA. The results of Western blotting also show that HYA and KetoA strongly suppressed promotion of the expression of mature and immature SREBP-1 induced by T0901317 (Figs. 9, 10). It was also shown that lipid synthesis-related genes (SCD-1, FAS, ACC1, 2) under transcriptional regulation by SREBP-1c also show down regulation by these fatty acids (Figs. 11-14). While the intracellular triacylglycerol level also increased by T0901317 (Fig. 15), the increase was significantly suppressed by the copresence of these fatty acids. An antagonizing action on nuclear receptor LXR that regulates SREBP-1c was examined by luciferase assay to find that these fatty acids significantly suppress the action of T0901317, thus antagonizing LXR (Fig. 16). In Figs. 8 - 16, * shows P<0.05, ** shows P<0.001, *** shows P<0.0001 (vs. T0901317 addition, fatty acid non-addition). By a similar method, αKetoA, γKetoA, sKetoA, KetoB, γKetoB, αKetoB, sKetoB, rKetoB, KetoC, γKetoC, αKetoC, sKetoC, KetoRA, αHYA, γHYA, sHYA, rHYA, HYB, αHYB, γHYB, sHYB, rHYB, RA, HYC, αHYC, γHYC and sHYC were also measured for SREBP-1c, mature and immature SREBP-1 expression, SCD-1, FAS, ACC1, 2, intracellular triacylglycerol level, and antagonizing action on LXR by luciferase assay. As a result, γHYA, γKetoA, αKetoA, HYB, rHYB, RA, rKetoB also showed a lipid synthesis suppressive action by the antagonizing action on LXR. From the above results, it was shown that HYA and KetoA from the fatty acids examined at this time have a strong lipid synthesis suppressive action by an antagonizing action on LXR. Similarly, rare fatty acids such as γHYA, γKetoA, αKetoA, HYB, rHYB, RA, rKetoB and the like were also shown to have a lipid synthesis suppressive action.
