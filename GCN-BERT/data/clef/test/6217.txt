The invention relates to compounds of the formulae (I), (II) and (III) in which R1, R2, R3, R4, Y, W1, W2, L, A, Alk, Cyc, Ar, Het1, Het2, Hal and n have the meaning indicated in claim 1, and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. The compounds of the formula (I) can be used for the inhibition of serine/threonine protein kinases and for the sensitisation of cancer cells to anticancer agents and/or ionising radiation. The invention also relates to the use of the compounds of the formula (I) in the prophylaxis, therapy or progress control of cancer, tumours, metastases or angiogenesis disorders, in combination with radiotherapy and/or an anticancer agent. The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (I) by reaction of compounds of the formulae (II) and (III) and optionally conversion of a base or acid of the compounds of the formula (I) into one of their salts. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase which is activated in conjunction with DNA. Biochemical and genetic data show that DNA-PK consists (a) of a catalytic sub-unit, which is called DNA-PKcs, and (b) two regulatory components (Ku70 and Ku80). In functional terms, DNA-PK is a crucial constituent on the one hand of the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and on the other hand of somatic or V(D)J recombination. In addition, DNA-PK and its components are connected with a multiplicity of further physiological processes, including modulation of the chromatin structure and telomeric maintenance (Smith & Jackson (1999) Genes and Dev 13: 916; Goytisolo et al. (2001) Mol. Cell. Biol. 21: 3642; Williams et al. (2009) Cancer Res. 69: 2100). Human genetic material in the form of DNA is constantly subjected to attack by reactive oxygen species (ROSs), which are formed principally as by-products of oxidative metabolism. ROSs are capable of causing DNA damage in the form of single-strand breaks. Double-strand breaks can arise if prior single-strand breaks occur in close proximity. In addition, single- and double-strand breaks may be caused if the DNA replication fork encounters damaged base patterns. Furthermore, exogenous influences, such as ionising radiation (for example gamma or heavy-ion radiation), and certain anticancer medicaments (for example bleomycin) are capable of causing DNA double-strand breaks. DSBs may furthermore occur as intermediates of somatic recombination, a process which is important for the formation of a functional immune system of all vertebrates. If DNA double-strand breaks are not repaired or are repaired incorrectly, mutations and/or chromosome aberrations may occur, which may consequently result in cell death. In order to counter the severe dangers resulting from DNA double-strand breaks, eukaryotic cells have developed a number of mechanisms to repair them. Higher eukaryotes use predominantly so-called non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), in which the DNA-dependent protein kinase adopts the key role. Biochemical investigations have shown that DNA-PK is activated most effectively by the occurrence of DNA-DSBs. Cell lines whose DNA-PK components have mutated and are non-functional prove to be radiation-sensitive (Smith and Jackson, 1999). Owing to its catalytic domain, which is in the C-terminal catalytic sub-unit (DNA-PKcs), which numbers about 500 amino acids, DNA-PK belongs to the family of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs), where DNA-PK is not a lipid kinase (Hartley et al. (1995) Cell 82: 849; Smith & Jackson (1999) Genes and Dev 13: 916; Lempiäinen & Halazonetis (2009) EMBO J. 28: 3067). The protein kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase) likewise belongs to the PIKK family. It too has central importance in the recognition of DNA damage. Patients suffering from ataxia telangiectasia exhibit, inter alia, increased sensitivity to ionising radiation. (Lavin & Shiloh (1997) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 15: 177; Rotman & Shiloh (1998) Hum. Mol. Genet. 7: 1555). It has been described by Izzard et al. (1999) Cancer Res. 59: 2581, that the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 inhibits the function of DNA-PK in in-vitro experiments. The IC50 value (concentration at which 50% of the enzyme activity is inhibited) is at a relatively ineffective 1.25 μM (5.0 mM ATP). Although the evidence that the inhibitor LY294002 allows mammal cells to become more radiation-sensitive, i.e. the cytotoxicity of ionising radiation is increased, in principle implies use in the irradiation therapy of, for example, solid cancer tumours, only a weak increase in sensitivity to ionising irradiation has been demonstrated for LY294002 in cellular terms (Rosenzweig et al. (1999) Clin. Cancer Res. 3: 1149). KuDOS Pharmaceuticals Ltd. have optimised the lead structure LY294002 and presented various DNA-PK inhibitors. The introduction of a dibenzothiophenyl group led to the inhibitor NU-7441, an ATP-competitive compound having an IC50 value of 20.0 nM (Hardcastle et al. (2005) J. Med. Chem. 48: 7829). KU-0060648 combines inhibitory properties with respect to DNA-PK with an improved solubility profile in aqueous medium, but the kinases of the PI3K isoenzyme family are likewise potently inhibited by KU-0060648. The long-existing need for a potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor has consequently not been satisfied to date. The invention is based on the object of overcoming the disadvantages indicated in the prior art and of developing effective inhibitors of DNA-PK which are selective with respect to the related kinases of the PIKK family and are of low molecular size and, in particular, enable effective application in cancer therapy as radio- and chemosensitisers—with the aim of improving the therapeutic efficacy with a simultaneous reduction in side effects. The object of the invention is achieved in accordance with the independent claims. The sub-claims contain preferred embodiments. In accordance with the invention, compounds of the formula (I) are provided in which R1 denotes H, Hal, CN, A, OY, NYY or —NH—C(NYY)═NY,R2 denotes H, Cyc, Ar, Het1 or Het2,R3 denotes Y, OH or OA,R4 denotes H or Hal,Y denotes H, A or Alk-OA,W1, W2, independently of one another, denote CHR3 or NH,W1-W2 together also denote CH═CH,L denotes a single bond, CYR3-, —CO—, —CO—NY—, —NY—CO—, —NY—CO—NY—, —NY—SO2—, —C(═NR3)-, —C(═N—CN)—, -Alk-, -Alk-NY—, Alk-CO—, -Alk-CO—NY—, -AlkO—, -Alk-OAlk-, -Alk-C(Y)(OY)—, —C(Y)(CN)—, —C(Y)(Het1)-, —C(R3)(Het1)-, —C(Y)(Het1)—NY—, —C(Y)(Het2)-, —C(Y)(OY)—, —(C(Y)(OCOOY)—, —C(Y)(NYY)—, —C(Y)(NY—COY)—, —C(Y)(NY—CO—NYY)—, —C(Y)(OAlk-CN)—, —C(Y)(OAlk-Het2)-, —C(Y)(OAlk-NYY)—, —C(Y)(OAlk-CO—NYY)—, —C(Y)(OY)-Alk-, —C(Y)(OCO—NYY)—, —C(Y)(OCO—NY-Alk-COOY)— or —C(Y)(OY)-Het1-Alk-OCO—NY—,A denotes unbranched or branched alkyl having 1-10 C atoms, where 1-7 H atoms may be replaced, independently of one another, by Hal,Alk denotes alkylene having 1-6 C atoms, where 1-4 H atoms may be replaced, independently of one another, by Hal and/or CN,Cyc denotes cyclic alkyl having 3-7 C atoms, where 1-4 H atoms may be replaced, independently of one another, by A, Hal and/or OY,Ar denotes phenyl, naphthyl or biphenyl, each of which is unsubstituted or mono-, di- or trisubstituted by Y, OY, Hal, CN, COOY, -Alk-OY, NYY, —NY—COY, SiY3, Cyc and/or phenyl,Het1 denotes mono- or bicyclic heteroaryl having 2-9 C atoms and 1-4 N, O and/or S atoms, which may be unsubstituted or mono-, di- or trisubstituted by Y, OY, Hal, CN, COOY, -Alk-OY, NYY, —NY—COY, -Alk-Het2, -Alk-OCO-Het2, -Alk-OCO—NY-Het2, —NY—CO-Het2, —NY—CO-Alk-Het2, SiY3, Cyc and/or phenyl,Het2 denotes a monocyclic saturated heterocycle having 2-7 C atoms and 1-4 N, O and/or S atoms, which may be unsubstituted or monosubstituted by R3 and/or COY,Hal denotes F, Cl, Br or I, andn denotes 1, 2, 3 or 4, and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. Surprisingly, it has been found that the compounds according to the invention are provided with inhibiting properties for serine/threonine protein kinases. The compounds of the formula (I) are designed in such a way, through their core structure of the quinazoline, to which a morpholinyl radical and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle are attached, that potent and selective inhibition of DNA-PK occurs. The compounds according to the invention thus open up entirely new possibilities with respect to the anticarcinogenic action of anticancer agents. Remarkably, the compounds of the formula (I) play a therapeutic role as radio- and chemosensitisers in the treatment of cancer. To date, it is merely known from WO 1992/07844 that 2,4-diaminoquinazoline derivatives are enhancers of chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer. The derivatives address the multiple resistance of tumour cells as a consequence of overexpression of the mdr1 gene, whose gene product of an efflux P glycoprotein pump keeps the intracellular active-compound concentration low. No physicochemical or pharmacological data are disclosed, nor is a marketed medicament known. By contrast, the present invention reveals that specifically compounds of the formula (I) are capable of the specific inhibition of serine/threonine protein kinases, such as DNA-PK. The compounds according to the invention and salts thereof consequently have valuable pharmacological properties while at the same time being well tolerated. In an embodiment of the present invention, pyridylmethoxy is excluded in the definition of the Het2 radical if the R1 radical denotes the radical NYY. For the purposes of the invention, the compounds of the formula (I) are defined in such a way that they are also taken to mean pharmaceutically usable derivatives, salts, hydrates, solvates, precursors of the compounds, tautomers and optically active forms (such as, for example, stereoisomers, diastereomers, enantiomers, racemates). Solvates of the compounds are taken to mean adductions of inert solvent molecules onto the compounds, which form owing to their mutual attractive force. Solvates are, for example, mono- or dihydrates or alcoholates. The invention naturally also encompasses the solvates of the salts of the compounds according to the invention. Pharmaceutically usable derivatives are taken to mean, for example, the salts of the compounds according to the invention and so-called precursors of the compounds. Precursors are taken to mean, for example, compounds of the formula (I) modified by means of alkyl or acyl groups, sugars or oligopeptides, which are rapidly cleaved in the organism to give the effective compounds according to the invention. These also include biodegradable polymer derivatives of the compounds according to the invention, as described, for example, in Int. J. Pharm. 115, 61-67 (1995). Any compound which can be converted in vivo into a bioactive agent, i.e. compounds of the formula (I), is a precursor in the sense of this invention. Any biologically active compound which results from the in-vivo metabolization of a compound according to the invention is a metabolite in the sense of the present invention. The compounds of the formula (I) can have one or more chiral centres and therefore occur in various stereoisomeric forms. The formula (I) encompasses all these forms. The invention also relates to the use of mixtures of the compounds of the formula (I), for example mixtures of two diastereomers, for example in the ratio 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:10, 1:100 or 1:1000. Particular preference is given here to mixtures of stereoisomeric compounds. Above and below, the radicals R1, R2, R3, Y, W1, W2, L, A, Alk, Cyc, Ar, Het1, Het2, Hal and n have the meanings indicated for the formula (I), unless expressly indicated otherwise. If individual radicals occur a number of times within a compound or radical, the radicals adopt, independently of one another, the meanings indicated, unless expressly indicated otherwise. For example, the radicals YY in radical R1, in which they occur a number of times, are identical or different, but are preferably in each case selected, independently of one another, from the meanings indicated above and/or below (for example methyl and/or ethyl), unless expressly indicated otherwise. The terms used here for the definition of the compounds are generally based on the rules of the IUPAC organisation for chemical compounds and in particular organic compounds. The terms for explanation of the above-mentioned compounds of the invention always have the following meanings, unless indicated otherwise in the description or claims. The term “unsubstituted” means that a radical, a group or a residue carries no substituents. The term “substituted” means that a radical, a group or a residue carries one or more substituents. “Alkyl” or “A” in the sense of the invention denotes a non-cyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical, which is unbranched (linear) or branched and preferably has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 C atoms, i.e. C1-10-alkanyl. Examples of alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 1,1-, 1,2- or 2,2-dimethylpropyl, 1-ethylpropyl, 1-ethyl-1-methylpropyl, 1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl, 1,1,2- or 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, 1-, 2- or 3-methylbutyl, 1,1-, 1,2-, 1,3-, 2,2-, 2,3- or 3,3-dimethylbutyl, 1- or 2-ethylbutyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, tert-pentyl, 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-methylpentyl, hexyl.

Very particular preference is given to C1-4-alkyl. A C1-4-alkyl is, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl or bromomethyl, most preferably methyl, ethyl or trifluoromethyl. It goes without saying that the respective meanings of “A” are independent of one another in the radicals R1, R3, Y and Cyc. “Cycloalkyl” or “Cyc” in the sense of the invention denotes saturated and partially unsaturated non-aromatic cyclic hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 3 rings, which contain 3 to 20, preferably 3 to 12, particularly preferably 3 to 9, C atoms. The bonding to the basic structure of the formula (I) can take place via any ring member of the cycloalkyl group. Examples of suitable cycloalkyl are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, cyclodecyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl and cyclooctadienyl. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, “Cyc” is cyclic alkyl having 3-7 C atoms, where 1-4 H atoms may be replaced, independently of one another, by A, Hal and/or OY. Particular preference is given to cyclic alkyl having 3-6 C atoms. It goes without saying that the respective meanings of “Cyc” are independent of one another in the radicals R2, Ar and Het1. The basic structure of the formula (I) here is any generic or non-generic structure to which any radical in the sense of the invention, such as, for example, Cyc, Ar, Het1 or Het2, can be bonded in order to obtain a compound of the formula (I) according to the invention. The term “Alk” in the sense of the invention denotes unbranched or branched alkylene, alkenyl or alkynyl having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 C atoms, i.e. C1-6-alkylenes, C2-6-alkenyls and C2-6-alkynyls. Alkenyls have at least one C—C double bond and alkynyls have at least one C—C triple bond. Alkynyls may in addition have at least one C—C double bond. Examples of suitable alkylenes are methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene, iso-propylene, isobutylene, sec-butylene, 1-, 2- or 3-methylbutylene, 1,1-, 1,2- or 2,2-dimethyl-propylene, 1-ethylpropylene, 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-methylpentylene, 1,1-, 1,2-, 1,3-, 2,2-, 2,3- or 3,3-dimethylbutylene, 1- or 2-ethylbutylene, 1-ethyl-1-methylpropylene, 1-ethyl-2-methylpropylene, 1,1,2- or 1,2,2-trimethylpropylene. Examples of suitable alkenyls are allyl, vinyl, propenyl (—CH2CH═CH2; —CH═CH—CH3; —C(═CH2)—CH3), 1-, 2- or 3-butenyl, isobutenyl, 2-methyl-1- or 2-butenyl, 3-methyl-1-butenyl, 1,3-butadienyl, 2-methyl-1,3-butadienyl, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadienyl, 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-pentenyl and hexenyl. Examples of suitable alkynyls are ethynyl, propynyl (—CH2—C≡CH; —C≡C—CH3), 1-, 2- or 3-butynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl or pent-3-en-1-ynyl, in particular propynyl. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, “Alk” is alkylene having 1-6 C atoms, i.e. methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene or hexylene, where 1-4 H atoms may be replaced, independently of one another, by Hal and/or CN. It is particularly preferred for “Alk” to denote alkylene having 1-3 C atoms, where 1-2 H atoms may be replaced by Hal. Particular examples thereof are methylene, ethylene and propylene. It goes without saying that the respective meanings of “Alk” in the radicals Y, L, Ar and Het1 are independent of one another. The term “aryl”, “carboaryl” or “Ar” in the sense of the invention denotes a mono- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon system having 3 to 14, preferably 4 to 10, particularly preferably 5 to 8, C atoms, which may optionally be substituted. The term “aryl” includes systems in which the aromatic ring is part of a bi- or polycyclic saturated, partially unsaturated and/or aromatic system, for example if the aromatic ring is fused to “aryl”, “cycloalkyl”, “heteroaryl” or “heterocyclyl” via any desired ring member of the aryl radical. The bonding to the basic structure of the formula (I) can take place via any ring member of the aryl group. Examples of suitable “aryl” are phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, anthracenyl, indanyl, indenyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl, in particular phenyl, o-, m- or p-tolyl, o-, m- or p-ethylphenyl, o-, m- or p-propylphenyl, o-, m- or p-isopropylphenyl, o-, m- or p-tert-butylphenyl, o-, m- or p-trifluoromethylphenyl, o-, m- or p-fluorophenyl, o-, m- or p-bromophenyl, o-, m- or p-chlorophenyl, o-, m- or p-hydroxyphenyl, o-, m- or p-methoxy-phenyl, o-, m- or p-methylsulfonylphenyl, o-, m- or p-nitrophenyl, o-, m- or p-aminophenyl, o-, m- or p-methylaminophenyl, o-, m- or p-dimethylaminophenyl, o-, m- or p-aminosulfonylphenyl, o-, m- or p-methylaminosulfonylphenyl, o-, m- or p-aminocarbonyl-phenyl, o-, m- or p-carboxyphenyl, o-, m- or p-methoxycarbonylphenyl, o-, m- or p-ethoxycarbonylphenyl, o-, m- or p-acetylphenyl, o-, m- or p-formylphenyl, o-, m- or p-cyano-phenyl, 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6-, 3,4- or 3,5-difluorophenyl, 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6-, 3,4- or 3,5-dichlorophenyl, 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6-, 3,4- or 3,5-dibromophenyl, 2,3,4-, 2,3,5-, 2,3,6-, 2,4,6- or 3,4,5-trichlorophenyl, p-iodophenyl, 4-fluoro-3-chlorophenyl, 2-fluoro-4-bromophenyl, 2,5-difluoro-4-bromophenyl or 2,5-dimethyl-4-chlorophenyl. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, “Ar” is phenyl, naphthyl or biphenyl, each of which is unsubstituted or mono-, di- or trisubstituted by Y, OY, Hal, CN, COOY, -Alk-OY, NYY, —NY—COY, SiY3, Cyc and/or phenyl. It is particularly preferred for “Ar” to denote phenyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted by R3 or Hal, very particularly preferably phenyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted by A, OA or Hal, most preferably phenyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted by methyl, methoxy or trifluoromethyl. The term “heteroaryl” in the sense of the invention denotes a 2 to 15, preferably 2 to 9, particularly preferably 5-, 6- or 7-membered mono- or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon radical which contains at least 1, if appropriate also 2, 3, 4 or 5 heteroatoms, in particular nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulfur, where the heteroatoms are identical or different. The number of nitrogen atoms is preferably 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, and the number of oxygen and sulfur atoms is, independently of one another, 0 or 1. The term “heteroaryl” includes systems in which the aromatic ring is part of a bi- or polycyclic saturated, partially unsaturated and/or aromatic system, for example if the aromatic ring is fused to “aryl”, “cycloalkyl”, “heteroaryl” or “heterocyclyl” via any desired ring member of the heteroaryl radical. The bonding to the basic structure of the formula (I) can take place via any ring member of the heteroaryl group, so long as it appears chemically sensible, where bonding via the C atoms is preferred. “Heteroaryl” denotes, irrespective of further substitutions, for example 2- or 3-furyl, 2- or 3-thienyl, 1-, 2- or 3-pyrrolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-imidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4- or 5-pyrazolyl, 2-, 4- or 5-oxazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isoxazolyl, 2-, 4- or 5-thiazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isothiazolyl, 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl, 2-, 4-, 5- or 6-pyrimidinyl, 1,2,3-triazol-1-, -4- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-triazol-1-, -3- or 5-yl, 1- or 5-tetrazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazol-4- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3- or -5-yl, 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- or -5-yl, 1,2,3-thiadiazol-4- or -5-yl, 3- or 4-pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indolyl, 4- or 5-isoindolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-benzimidazolyl, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-benzopyrazolyl, 2-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-benzoxazolyl, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-benzisoxazolyl, 2-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-benzothiazolyl, 2-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-benzisothiazolyl, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-benz-2,1,3-oxadiazolyl, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-isoquinolyl, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-cinolinyl, 2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinazolinyl, 5- or 6-quinoxalinyl, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-2H-benzo-1,4-oxazinyl, 1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl, 1,4-benzodioxan-6-yl, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4- or -5-yl, 2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-5-yl, imidazolyl, triazinyl, phthalazinyl, indolizinyl, pteridinyl, carbazolyl, phenazinyl, phenoxazinyl, phenothiazinyl or acridinyl. The heterocyclic radicals may also be partially or fully hydrogenated. Unsubstituted heteroaryl may thus, for example, also denote 2,3-dihydro-2-, -3-, -4- or -5-furyl, 2,5-dihydro-2-, -3-, -4- or 5-furyl, tetrahydro-2- or -3-furyl, 1,3-dioxolan-4-yl, tetrahydro-2- or -3-thienyl, 2,3-dihydro-1-, -2-, -3-, -4- or -5-pyrrolyl, 2,5-dihydro-1-, -2-, -3-, -4- or -5-pyrrolyl, 1-, 2- or 3-pyrrolidinyl, tetrahydro-1-, -2- or -4-imidazolyl, 2,3-dihydro-1-, -2-, -3-, -4- or -5-pyrazolyl, tetrahydro-1-, -3- or -4-pyrazolyl, 1,4-dihydro-1-, -2-, -3- or -4-pyridyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-, -2-, -3-, -4-, -5- or -6-pyridyl, 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-piperidinyl, 2-, 3- or 4-morpholinyl, tetrahydro-2-, -3- or -4-pyranyl, 1,4-dioxanyl, 1,3-dioxan-2-, -4- or -5-yl, hexahydro-1-, -3- or -4-pyridazinyl, hexahydro-1-, -2-, -4- or -5-pyrimidinyl, 1-, 2- or 3-piperazinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-, -2-, -3-, -4-, -5-, -6-, -7- or -8-quinolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-, -2-, -3-, -4-, -5-, -6-, -7- or -8-isoquinolyl, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo-1,4-oxazinyl, 2,3-methylenedioxyphenyl, 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl, 2,3-ethylenedioxyphenyl, 3,4-ethylenedioxyphenyl, 3,4-(difluoromethylenedioxy)phenyl, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5- or 6-yl, 2,3-(2-oxomethylene-dioxy)phenyl, or also 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,5-benzodioxepin-6- or -7-yl, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuranyl or 2,3-dihydro-2-oxofuranyl. “Heteroaryl” in the sense of “Het1” preferably denotes a mono- or bicyclic aromatic heterocycle having 2-9 C atoms and 1-4 N, O and/or S atoms, which may be unsubstituted or mono-, di- or trisubstituted by Y, OY, Hal, CN, COOY, -Alk-OY, NYY, —NY—COY, -Alk-Het2, -Alk-OCO-Het2, -Alk-OCO—NY-Het2, —NY—CO-Het2, —NY—CO-Alk-Het2, —NY—CO-Het1, SiY3, Cyc and/or phenyl. It is particularly preferred for “Het1” to denote mono- or bicyclic heteroaryl having 2-8 C atoms and 1-3 N, O and/or S atoms, which may be unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted by Y or Hal. “Het1” is very particularly preferably heteroaryl which is unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted by Y or Hal, selected from the group: It goes without saying that the bond drawn in in the preferred structures above and below merely symbolises the link to the basic structure of the formula (I), without being restricted to one or more particular ring atoms. In particular, the link in the case of a bicyclic group is not intended to be restricted to the ring containing the bond drawn, although this ring is to be regarded as preferred. “Het1” most preferably denotes heteroaryl which is unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted by A or Hal, selected from the group: It goes without saying that the respective meanings of “Het1” in the radicals R2 and L are independent of one another. The term “heterocycle” in the sense of the invention denotes a mono- or polycyclic system having 3 to 20 ring atoms, preferably 3 to 14 ring atoms, particularly preferably 3 to 10 ring atoms, comprising C atoms and 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 heteroatoms, in particular nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulfur, where the heteroatoms are identical or different. The cyclic system may be saturated or mono- or polyunsaturated. The term “heteroaryl” includes systems in which the aromatic ring is part of a bi- or polycyclic saturated, partially unsaturated and/or aromatic system, for example if the aromatic ring is fused to “aryl”, “cycloalkyl”, “heteroaryl” or “heterocyclyl” via any desired ring member of the heterocycle.

This means that the said radicals may adopt all meanings assigned to them, as described above or below, including any preferred embodiments, without being restricted thereto and independently of their occurrence in another particular context.

The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent and generally in the presence of an acid-binding agent, preferably an organic base, such as DIPEA, triethylamine, dim ethylaniline, pyridine, quinoline, piperidine or diethanolamine. The addition of an alkali-metal or alkaline-earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate or another salt of a weak acid of the alkali or alkaline-earth metals, preferably of potassium, sodium, calcium or caesium, may also be favourable. Suitable bases are metal oxides, such as, for example, aluminium oxide, alkali-metal hydroxides (including potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide), alkaline-earth metal hydroxides (for example barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide) and alkali-metal alkoxides (for example potassium ethoxide and sodium propoxide).

The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of intermediate compounds of the part-formula (IIB), in which a compound of the formula (IID) in which R4 and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning, is reacted with a halogenating agent in an amine, preferably an organic amine, to give the intermediate compounds of the part-formula (IIB) in which R4 and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning. The invention still furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the formulae (IID-1) and/or (IID) having the following steps: (a) reaction of a compound of the formula (IIE) in which R5 denotes morpholinyl or Hal, and R4 and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning, with formamidine acetate in an alcohol to give the compounds of the formula (IID-1) in which R5 denotes morpholinyl or Hal, and R4 and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning, and, if R5 is Hal, (b) reaction of the compounds of the formula (IID-1) with morpholine to give the compounds of the formula (IID) in which R4 and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning.

The invention furthermore relates to intermediate compounds of the formula (III) in which R2, R3, Y, W1, W2, L, A, Alk, Cyc, Ar, Het1, Het2, Hal and n have the above-mentioned meaning, and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, intermediate compounds having the part-formula (IIIA) are provided in which Het1 denotes unsubstituted heteroaryl from the group: and R3, Y, A, Alk and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning, and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, intermediate compounds having the part-formula (IIIB) are provided in which Het1 denotes unsubstituted heteroaryl from the group: R3 denotes H, OH or OA, and A and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning, and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. In a very particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, intermediate compounds having the part-formulae (IIIC), (IIID) and (IIIE) are provided and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. The present invention still furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of intermediate compounds of the part-formula (IIIB) having the following steps: (a) reaction of a compound R4-Het1, in which R4 denotes H or Hal, andHet1 and Hal have the meaning indicated under formula (IIIB),with a compound of the formula (IIIF) in which PG denotes protecting group, to give a compound (IIIG) in which PG denotes protecting group, and Het1, R3, A and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning, and (b) cleaving-off of the protecting group and optionally the R3 group under acidic reaction conditions to give the intermediate compounds of the formula (IIIB) in which Het1, R3, A and Hal have the above-mentioned meaning. The starting compounds are generally known. If they are novel, they can be prepared by methods known per se. The compounds of the formulae (IIC) and (IIIF) can be prepared by known methods. If desired, the starting materials can be formed in situ, so that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture, but instead are immediately converted further into the compounds according to the invention. It is likewise possible to carry out the reaction step-wise. The said compounds according to the invention can be used in their final non-salt form. On the other hand, the present invention also encompasses the use of these compounds in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which can be derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases by procedures known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds of the formulae (I), (II) and (III) and part-formulae thereof are for the most part prepared by conventional methods. If the compounds contain a carboxyl group, one of its suitable salts can be formed by reacting the compound with a suitable base to give the corresponding base-addition salt. Such bases are, for example, alkali-metal hydroxides (for example potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide), alkaline-earth metal hydroxides (for example barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide), alkali-metal alkoxides (for example potassium ethoxide and sodium propoxide) and various organic bases, such as piperidine, diethanolamine and N-methylglutamine. A base of the formulae (I), (II) and (III) and part-formulae thereof can be converted into the associated acid-addition salt using an acid, for example by reaction of equivalent amounts of the base and the acid in an inert solvent, such as, for example, ethanol, with subsequent evaporation. Suitable acids for this reaction are, in particular, those which give physiologically acceptable salts, such as, for example, hydrogen halides (for example hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide), other mineral acids and corresponding salts thereof (for example sulfate, nitrate or phosphate and the like), alkyl- and monoarylsulfonates (for example ethanesulfonate, toluenesulfonate and benzenesulfonate) and other organic acids and corresponding salts thereof (for example acetate, trifluoroacetate, tartrate, maleate, succinate, citrate, benzoate, salicylate, ascorbate and the like. Salts with physiologically unacceptable acids, for example picrates, can be used for the isolation and/or purification of the compounds of the formula (I). With regard to that stated above, it can be seen that the expression “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” in the present connection is taken to mean an active compound which comprises a compound of the formula (I) in the form of one of its salts, in particular if this salt form imparts improved pharmacokinetic properties on the active compound compared with the free form of the active compound. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of the active compound can also provide this active compound for the first time with a desired pharmacokinetic property and can even have a positive influence on the pharmacodynamics of this active compound with respect to its therapeutic efficacy in the body. Compounds according to the invention may be chiral owing to their molecular structure and may accordingly occur in various enantiomeric forms. They may therefore be in racemic or optically active form. Since the pharmaceutical efficacy of the racemates or stereoisomers of the compounds of the formula (I) may differ, it may be desirable to use the enantiomers. In these cases, the end product, or even the intermediate, may be separated into enantiomeric compounds by chemical or physical measures known to the person skilled in the art or already employed as such in the synthesis. Surprisingly, it has been found that the compounds according to the invention cause specific inhibition of serine/threonine protein kinases. The invention therefore furthermore relates to the use of compounds of the formula (I) or part-formulae thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, for the inhibition of serine/threonine protein kinases, preferably PIKKs, particularly preferably DNA-PK. The term “inhibition” relates to any reduction in the activity which is based on the action of the specific compounds according to the invention in that the latter are capable of interacting with the target molecule in such a way that recognition, binding and blocking is made possible. The compounds are distinguished by high affinity to at least one serine/threonine protein kinases, ensuring reliable binding and preferably complete blocking of the kinase activity. The compounds are particularly preferably monospecific in order to guarantee exclusive and direct recognition of the selected kinase. The term “recognition” relates here to any type of interaction between the compound and the said target molecules, in particular covalent or non-covalent bonds, such as, for example, a covalent bond, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, van der Waals forces, ion attraction, hydrogen bonds, ligand/receptor interactions, base pairs of nucleotides or interactions between epitope and antibody binding site. The compounds according to the invention exhibit an advantageous biological activity which can be demonstrated in the tests described herein, such as, for example, enzyme-based assays. Measurement of the kinase activity is a technique which is well known to the person skilled in the art. Generic test systems for the determination of the kinase activity using substrates, for example histone (Alessi et al. (1996) FEBS Lett. 399(3): 333) or the basic myelin protein, are described in the literature (Campos-González & Glenney (1992) JBC 267: 14535). Various assay systems are available for the identification of kinase inhibitors. In the scintillation proximity assay (Sorg et al. (2002) J Biomolecular Screening 7: 11) and the flashplate assay, the radioactive phosphorylation of a protein or peptide as substrate are measured using ATP. In the presence of an inhibitory compound, a decreased radioactive signal, or none at all, is detectable. Furthermore, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTR-FRET) and fluorescence polarisation (FP) technologies are useful as assay methods (Sills et al. (2002) J Biomolecular Screening 191). Other non-radioactive ELISA methods use specific phospho-antibodies (phospho-ABs). The phospho-AB binds only the phosphorylated substrate. This binding can be detected by chemiluminescence using a second peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep antibody. The above-mentioned use of the compounds can take place in in-vitro or in-vivo models. The susceptibility of a particular cell to treatment with the compounds according to the invention can be determined by testing in vitro. Typically, a culture of the cell is incubated with a compound according to the invention at various concentrations for a period of time which is sufficient to enable the active agents to induce cell death or to inhibit cell proliferation, cell vitality or migration, usually between about one hour and one week. For testing in vitro, cultivated cells from a biopsy sample can be used. The amount of cells remaining after the treatment is then determined. The use in vitro takes place, in particular, on samples of mammal species which are suffering from cancer, tumours, metastases, angiogenesis disorders, retroviral diseases, immune diseases and/or pathogenic ageing processes. The host or patient can belong to any mammal species, for example a primate species, in particular humans, but also rodents (including mice, rats and hamsters), rabbits, horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. Animal models are of interest for experimental investigations, providing a model for the treatment of a human disease. The testing of a plurality of specific compounds enables the selection of the active compound which appears the most suitable for the treatment of the patient. The in-vivo dose of the selected compound is advantageously matched to the susceptibility of the kinase and/or severity of the disease of the patient taking into account the in-vitro data, as a result of which the therapeutic efficacy is noticeably increased. The dose varies depending on the specific compound used, the specific disease, the patient status, etc. A therapeutic dose is typically sufficient considerably to reduce the undesired cell population in the target tissue, while the viability of the patient is maintained. The following teaching of the invention and embodiments thereof relating to the use of compounds of the formula (I) for the preparation of a medicament for the prophylaxis, therapy and/or progress control is valid and can be applied without restrictions to the use of the compounds for the inhibition of the kinase activity, if it appears appropriate. The treatment is generally continued until a considerable reduction has occurred, for example at least about 50% reduction of the cell load, and can be continued until essentially no more undesired cells are detected in the body. In tests of this type, the compounds according to the invention exhibit and cause an inhibiting effect, which is usually documented by IC50 values in a suitable range, preferably in the micromolar range and more preferably in the nanomolar range. The kinase is inhibited, in particular, to the extent of 50% if the concentration of the compounds is less than 1 μM, preferably less than 0.5 μM, particularly preferably less than 0.1 μM. This concentration is called the IC50 value. The invention also relates to a medicament comprising at least one compound of the formula (I) or part-formulae thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as active compound, an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula (I) or part-formulae thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, together with pharmaceutically tolerated assistants. A “medicament”, “drug” and a “pharmaceutical composition” or “pharmaceutical formulation” here is any composition which can be employed in the prophylaxis, therapy, progress control or aftertreatment of patients who, at least temporarily, exhibit a pathogenic modification of the overall condition or the condition of individual parts of the patient organism, preferably as a consequence of cancer, tumours, metastases, angiogenesis disorders, retroviral diseases, immune diseases and/or accelerated ageing processes, particularly preferably as a consequence of cancer, tumours, metastases and/or angiogenesis disorders. In order to increase the protective or therapeutic action of the compounds according to the invention, pharmaceutically tolerated adjuvants can be added. For the purposes of the invention, any substance which facilitates, enhances or modifies an effect with the compounds in accordance with the invention is an “adjuvant”. Known adjuvants are, for example, aluminium compounds, such as, for example, aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate, saponins, such as, for example, QS 21, muramyl dipeptide or muramyl tripeptide, proteins, such as, for example, gamma-interferon or TNF, MF 59, phosphatdibylcholine, squalene or polyols. The co-application of egg albumin in complete Freund's adjuvant can likewise cause increased cell-mediated immunity and thus support the action of neutralising antibodies formed. Furthermore, DNA, which has an immunostimulatory property, or which encodes a protein with an adjuvant effect, such as, for example, a cytokine, can be applied in parallel or in a construct. The introduction of the pharmaceutical composition into a cell or organism can be carried out in accordance with the invention in any manner which enables the kinases to be brought into contact with the compounds present in the composition, as a consequence of which a response is induced. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered orally, transdermally, transmucosally, transurethrally, vaginally, rectally, pulmonarily, enterally and/or parenterally. The type of administration selected depends on the indication, the dose to be administered, individual-specific parameters, etc. In particular, the various types of administration facilitate site-specific therapy, which minimises side effects and reduces the active-compound dose. Very particularly preferred injections are intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection. The administration can be carried out, for example, with the aid of so-called vaccination guns or by means of syringes. It is also possible to prepare the substance as an aerosol, which is inhaled by the organism, preferably a human patient. The administration forms of the pharmaceutical composition are prepared corresponding to the desired type of administration in a suitable dosage and in a manner known per se using the conventional solid or liquid vehicles and/or diluents and the assistants usually employed. Thus, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients known to the person skilled in the art can basically form part of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, where the amount of excipient material which is combined with the active compound in order to prepare a single dose varies depending on the individual to be treated and the type of administration. These pharmaceutically tolerated additives include salts, buffers, fillers, stabilisers, complexing agents, antioxidants, solvents, binders, lubricants, tablet coatings, flavours, dyes, preservatives, adjusters and the like. Examples of excipients of this type are water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, alkylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol triacetate, gelatine, carbohydrates, such as, for example, lactose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc and Vaseline. The pharmaceutical formulation can be in the form of a tablet, film tablet, dragee, lozenge, capsule, pill, powder, granules, syrup, juice, drops, solution, dispersion, suspension, suppository, emulsion, implant, cream, gel, ointment, paste, lotion, serum, oil, spray, aerosol, adhesive, plaster or bandage. Oral administration forms which are prepared are preferably tablets, film tablets, dragees, lozenges, capsules, pills, powders, granules, syrups, juices, drops, solutions, dispersions or suspensions—including as depot form. Furthermore, parenteral medicament forms, such as, for example, suppositories, suspensions, emulsions, implants or solutions, should be considered, preferably oily or aqueous solutions. For topical application, the medicament active compound is formulated in a conventional manner with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, such as, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, and optionally further assistants, such as, for example, moisturizers, to give solid formulations which can be applied to the skin, such as, for example, creams, gels, ointments, pastes, powders or emulsions, or to give liquid formulations which can be applied to the skin, such as, for example, solutions, suspensions, lotions, sera, oils, sprays or aerosols. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably in the form of an injection solution. For the preparation of the injection solution, aqueous media, such as, for example, distilled water or physiological salt solutions, can be used, where the latter include acidic and basic addition salts. The pharmaceutical composition may also be in the form of a solid composition, for example in the lyophilised state, and can then be prepared before use by addition of a dissolving agent, such as, for example, distilled water. The person skilled in the art is familiar with the basic principles of the preparation of lyophilisates. The concentration of the active compound in the formulation can be 0.1 to 100 percent by weight. It is crucial that the pharmaceutical composition comprises, as active compound, an effective amount of the compound together with the pharmaceutically tolerated assistants. The terms “effective amount” or “effective dose” are used interchangeably herein and denote an amount of the pharmaceutical active compound which has a prophylactically or therapeutically relevant action on a disease or pathological change in cell, tissue, organ or mammal. A “prophylactic action” prevents the outbreak of a disease or even infection with a pathogen after ingress of individual representatives in such a way that subsequent spread thereof is greatly reduced or they are even completely deactivated. A “prophylactic action” also includes an increase in normal physiological function. Prophylaxis is advisable, in particular, if an individual has predispositions for the onset of the above-mentioned diseases, such as, for example, a family history, a gene defect or a recently survived disease. A “therapeutically relevant action” frees in part or full from one, more than one or all disease symptoms or results in the partial or complete reversal of one, more than one or all physiological or biochemical parameters which are associated with or causally involved in the disease or pathological change into the normal state. Progress control is also taken to be a type of therapeutic treatment if the compounds are administered at certain time intervals, for example in order completely to eliminate the symptoms of a disease. The respective dose or dose range for the administration of the compounds according to the invention is sufficiently large to achieve the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect of induction of a biological or medical response. In general, the dose will vary with the age, constitution and gender of the patient, and the severity of the disease will be taken into account. It goes without saying that the specific dose, frequency and duration of administration are, in addition, dependent on a multiplicity of factors, such as, for example, the targeting and binding ability of the compounds, feeding habits of the individual to be treated, type of administration, excretion rate and combination with other drugs. The individual dose can be adjusted both with respect to the primary disease and also with respect to the occurrence of any complications. The precise dose can be established by a person skilled in the art using known means and methods. This teaching of the invention is valid and can be applied without restrictions to the pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds of the formula (I), if it appears appropriate. In an embodiment of the invention, the compounds are administered in a dose of 0.01 mg to 1 g per dosage unit, preferably between 1 to 700 mg, particularly preferably 5 to 100 mg. The daily dose is in particular between 0.02 and 100 mg/kg of body weight. In order to support the medical effect, the pharmaceutical composition may, in an embodiment of the invention, also comprise one or more further active compounds, where simultaneous or successive administration is conceivable. The therapeutic effect of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention can consist, for example, in certain anticancer agents having a better action through the inhibition of DNA-PK as a desired side effect or in the number of side effects of these medicaments being reduced by the reduction in the dose. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is combined with an anticancer agent. As used here, the term “anticancer agent” relates to any agent which is administered to a patient with cancer, tumours, metastases and/or angiogenesis disorders for the purpose of treatment of the cancer. The anticancer agent is particularly preferably selected from the group comprising cytokines, chemokines, pro-apoptotic agents, interferons, radioactive compounds, oestrogen receptor modulators, androgen receptor modulators, retinoid receptor modulators, cytotoxic agents, cytostatic agents, prenyl-protein transferase inhibitors and angiogenesis inhibitors or combinations thereof. It is preferred for the anticancer agent to modify, in particular reduce, nucleic acid and/or protein metabolism, cell division, DNA replication, purine, pyrimidine and/or amino acid biosynthesis, gene expression, mRNA processing, protein synthesis, apoptosis or combinations thereof. The invention can also be practised as a kit which comprises the compounds according to the invention. The kit consists of separate packs of (a) an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I) and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, and (b) an effective amount of a further active compound. The kit comprises suitable containers, such as, for example, boxes or cartons, individual bottles, bags or ampoules. The kit may, for example, comprise separate ampoules, each containing an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I) and/or pharmaceutically usable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, and an effective amount of a further medicament active compound in dissolved or lyophilised form. The kit of the invention may also contain an article which contains written instructions or points the user towards written instructions which explain the handling of the compounds of the invention. In accordance with the invention, the compounds of the formula (I) or part-formulae thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, are used for the prophylaxis, therapy and/or progress control of diseases which are caused, promoted and/or spread by the activity of serine/threonine protein kinases. The present invention therefore also relates to the use of compounds of the formula (I) or part-formulae thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, for the preparation of a medicament for the prophylaxis, therapy and/or progress control of diseases which are caused, promoted and/or spread by the activity of serine/threonine protein kinases. In accordance with the invention, compounds of the formula (I) or part-formulae thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, are suitable for use in the prophylaxis, therapy and/or progress control of diseases which are caused, promoted and/or spread by activity of serine/threonine protein kinases. For the identification of a corresponding signalling pathway and in order to detect interactions between various signalling pathways, suitable models or model systems have been developed, for example cell culture models (Khwaja et al. (1997) EMBO 16: 2783) and models of transgenic animals (White et al. (2001) Oncogene 20: 7064). In order to determine certain stages in the signalling cascade, interacting compounds can be used in order to modulate the signal (Stephens et al. (2000) Biochemical J 351: 95). In addition, the compounds according to the invention can also be used as reagents for testing kinase-dependent signalling pathways in animals and/or cell culture models or in the clinical diseases mentioned in this application. As discussed herein, these signalling pathways are relevant for various diseases. Accordingly, the compounds according to the invention are useful in the prophylaxis, therapy and/or progress control of diseases which are dependent on signalling pathways with participation by serine/threonine protein kinases. In accordance with the invention, the compounds of the formula (I) or part-formulae thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, are suitable for use in the prophylaxis, therapy and/or progress control of cancer, tumours, metastases, angiogenesis disorders, retroviral diseases and/or immune diseases, in particular cancer, tumours, metastases and/or angiogenesis disorders. In accordance with the invention, the compounds of the formula (I) or part-formulae thereof and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, are also suitable for use in the slowing of ageing processes, where the slowing takes place with reference to the comparison of the life span of the treated host or cells, cell cultures, tissues or organs thereof with corresponding positive or negative controls and/or statistics. It goes without saying that the host of the pharmaceutical compounds is also included in the scope of protection of the present invention. The tumour is, in particular, selected from the group of diseases of squamous epithelium, bladder, stomach, kidneys, head, neck, oesophagus, cervix, thyroid, intestine, liver, brain, prostate, urogenital tract, lymphatic system, larynx, lung, skin, blood and immune system, and/or the cancer is selected from the group of monocytic leukaemia, lung adenocarcinoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, bowel carcinoma, breast carcinoma, acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphatic leukaemia, chronic lymphatic leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A further embodiment of the present invention relates to the compounds according to the invention in combination with radiotherapy and/or with at least one further active compound, preferably in combination with radiotherapy and/or an anticancer agent. The compounds according to the invention achieve synergistic effects in existing cancer chemotherapies and irradiations and/or restore the efficacy of existing cancer chemotherapies and irradiations. The synergistic action of the inhibition of VEGF in combination with radiotherapy is described in the prior art (WO 00/61186). The further medicament active compounds are particularly preferably chemotherapeutic agents which inhibit angiogenesis and thus inhibit the growth and spread of tumour cells. Examples thereof are VEGF receptor inhibitors, comprising ribozymes and antisense which are directed at VEGF receptors, and angiostatin and endostatin. Further examples of antineoplastic agents which can be used in combination with the compounds according to the invention generally include alkylating agents, antimetabolites, epidophyllotoxin, an antineoplastic enzyme, a topoisomerase inhibitor, procarbazine, mitoxantrone or platinum coordination complexes. In another embodiment, the anticancer agent is particularly preferably selected from the group of oestrogen receptor modulator, androgen receptor modulator, retinoid receptor modulator, cytotoxic agent, cytostatic agent, prenyl-protein transferase inhibitor and angiogenesis inhibitor. In addition, the previous teaching of the invention and embodiments thereof relating to pharmaceutical composition is valid and can be applied without restrictions to the second medical indication, if it appears appropriate. A very particularly preferred embodiment encompasses the compounds according to the invention in combination with radiotherapy and/or a cytostatic agent. Still a further embodiment of the invention relates to the use of at least one compound of the formula (I) and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, for the sensitisation of cancer cells to anticancer agents and/or ionising radiation, with the proviso that the sensitisation does not take place in vivo on the human body. The sensitisation preferably takes place ex vivo or in vitro by administering the compounds to cells, cell cultures, tissues or organs which comprise serine/threonine protein kinases. The ex-vivo use is used, in particular, in the case of animal cells which originate from an animal organism which is affected by a disease which is selected from the group of cancer, tumours, metastases and/or angiogenesis disorders. The cells treated ex vivo can either continue to be kept in culture for subsequent investigations or transferred into an animal, which can be the host animal or another animal. The ex-vivo sensitisation according to the invention is particularly advantageous for testing the specific action of the compounds, so that the in-vivo dose can be pre-adjusted correspondingly with evaluation of these ex-vivo data. As a result thereof, the therapeutic effect is increased significantly. The invention furthermore teaches a method for the prophylaxis, therapy and/or progress control of cancer, tumours, metastases, angiogenesis disorders, retroviral diseases, immune diseases and/or ageing processes in which an effective amount of at least one compound according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts, tautomers and/or stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, is administered to a subject to be treated. Preferred subjects in the sense of the invention are humans or animals, particularly preferably humans. It is known to the person skilled in the art here that he can administer the compounds according to the invention, which can of course also be used as the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, in various doses to an organism, in particular a human patient. The effective amount and the type of administration can be determined by the person skilled in the art by routine experiments. The previous teaching of the invention and embodiments thereof are valid and can be applied without restrictions to the treatment method, if it appears appropriate. All said and further constituents or components are familiar to the person skilled in the art and can experience a specific embodiment for the teaching according to the invention in routine experiments. All documents cited in the description are hereby intended to be incorporated in their entirety into the disclosure of the present invention as reference. As part of the invention presented here, novel morpholinylquinazoline compounds of the formula (I) were provided for the first time. The compounds according to the invention control serine/threonine protein kinases, in particular DNA-PK, affinitively and/or selectively. The compounds from formula (I) and derivatives thereof are distinguished by high specificity and stability, low preparation costs and easy handling. These properties form the basis for a reproducible mode of action, including the absence of cross-reactivities, and reliable and safe interaction with the corresponding target structures. The invention also includes the use of the present morpholinylquinazoline derivatives for the inhibition, regulation and/or modulation of the signalling cascade of serine/threonine protein kinases, in particular DNA-PK, and thus offers novel tools for research and/or diagnostics. Medicaments and pharmaceutical compositions which comprise the said compounds and the use of these compounds for the treatment of kinase-promoted disorders are, in addition, a highly promising approach for a broad spectrum of therapies, enabling direct and immediate alleviation of symptoms to be achieved in humans and animals. This is particularly advantageous for effective combating of severe diseases, such as cancer, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antineoplastic therapies. The key participation by DNA-PK in DNA repair processes and the evidence that the DNA-PK inhibitors allows mammal cells to become more radiation-sensitive enable therapeutic use of DNA-PK or DNA-PK/ATM or ATM-specific inhibitors as part of the treatment of, for example, solid cancer tumours by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy aimed at DNA-DSBs. The compounds of the formula (I), salts, isomers, tautomers, enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates, derivatives, prodrugs and/or metabolites thereof are effective not only in the case of the said clinical disease pictures, but likewise in the diagnosis and therapy of all diseases in connection with the DNA-PK signalling cascade, in particular with respect to the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration. In addition, the inhibitors according to the invention can be used in the treatment of retroviral diseases by suppression of retroviral integration (R. Daniel (1999) Science 284: 644). Finally, the inhibitors according to the invention can be employed as immunomodulators and modulators of telomeric maintenance. The low-molecular-weight inhibitors are used individually and/or in combination with other treatment measures, such as, for example, surgical interventions, immunotherapy, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. The latter relate to targeted therapy with any desired NME (i.e. NCE and/or NBE) as monotherapy and/or on-target/off-target combination therapy. Owing to their surprisingly strong and/or selective inhibition of enzymes which regulate cellular processes via the repair of dsDNA, the compounds of the invention can be administered in advantageously low dose, while they achieve a similar or even superior biological efficacy compared with the less-potent or less-selective inhibitors of the prior art. The reduced dose is also accompanied by reduced or no medical side effects. In addition, the highly selective inhibition by the compounds according to the invention is also reflected by a reduction in undesired side effects, which is independent of the dose. It goes without saying that this invention is not restricted to the specific compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, uses and methods as described herein, since such things can be varied. It furthermore goes without saying that the terminology used here serves exclusively the purpose of description of particular embodiments and is not intended to restrict the scope of protection of the invention. As used here in the specification, including the appended claims, word forms in the singular, such as, for example, “a” or “the”, include the equivalent in the plural, so long as the context does not specifically indicate otherwise. For example, the reference to “a compound” includes a single compound or a plurality of compounds, which may in turn be identical or different, or the reference to “a method” includes equivalent steps and methods which are known to the person skilled in the art. The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to non-limiting examples of specific embodiments. The examples should, in particular, be interpreted as not being restricted to the feature combinations specifically illustrated, but instead the illustrative features can in turn be freely combined so long as the object of the invention is achieved.
