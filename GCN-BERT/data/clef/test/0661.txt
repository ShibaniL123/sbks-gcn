TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to curable composition for inkjet which can be applied in an inkjet mode, specifically a curable composition for inkjet which can be used suitably for forming a cured product layer such as a resist pattern on a substrate. The present invention also relates to a method for producing an electronic part which is equipped with a cured product layer formed from the curable composition for inkjet. BACKGROUND ART Many printed wiring boards in each of which a solder resist pattern that is a pattern-like solder resist film is formed on a substrate having a wiring line formed on the upper surface thereof have been used. The formation of fine solder resist patterns have been demanded in printed wiring boards with the decrease in size and the increase in density of electronic devices in which the printed wiring boards are installed. As a method for forming a fine solder resist pattern, a method of applying a solder resist composition in an inkjet mode has been proposed. In an inkjet mode, the number of steps is reduced compared with a case in which a solder resist pattern is formed in a screen printing mode. Therefore, a solder resist pattern can be formed easily and efficiently in an inkjet mode. When a solder resist composition is applied in an inkjet mode, it is required that the viscosity of the solder resist composition is low to some extent during the application of the composition. In recent years, on the other hand, an inkjet device that can print with a solder resist composition while warming the solder resist composition to 50° C. or higher. When the solder resist composition is warmed to 50° C. or higher in the inkjet device, the viscosity of the solder resist composition can become relatively low and, therefore, the ejection properties of the solder resist composition using the inkjet device would be further improved. A solder resist composition that can be applied in an inkjet mode is disclosed in Patent Document 1 shown below. Patent Document 1 discloses a curable composition for inkjet which comprises a monomer having a (meth)acryloyl group and a heat-curable functional group, a photo-reactive diluent having a weight average molecular weight of 700 or less and a photopolymerization initiator. The viscosity of the curable composition for inkjet is 150 mPa·s or less at 25° C. RELATED ART DOCUMENT Patent Document Patent Document 1: WO2004/099272A1 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention The curable composition for inkjet described in Patent Document 1 has a relatively low viscosity. Therefore, the curable composition for inkjet described in Patent Document 1 can be applied onto a substrate in an inkjet mode. In the curable composition for inkjet described in Patent Document 1, however, gelation often proceeds during storage. That is, the storage stability of the curable composition for inkjet is often low. In addition, the curable composition for inkjet described in Patent Document 1 has such a problem that the pot life of the curable composition under a condition having a temperature of 50° C. or higher is short, because the curable composition contains a monomer having a (meth)acryloyl group and a heat-curable functional group. For example, when a curable composition for inkjet is ejected using an inkjet device, the curable composition for inkjet generally stays in the inkjet device for a certain period of time after being supplied into the inkjet device. On the other hand, for the purpose of improving the ejection properties of the curable composition, the inside of the inkjet device is sometimes warmed to 50° C. or higher. In the inkjet device that is warmed to 50° C. or higher, the curing of the curable composition for inkjet described in Patent Document 1 often proceeds, which leads to the increase in the viscosity of the composition and the difficulty of the ejection of the composition. An object of the present invention is to provide: a curable composition for inkjet which can have improved storage stability; and a method for producing an electronic part using the curable composition for inkjet. A limited object of the present invention is to provide: a curable composition for inkjet which has a long pot life under a condition, i.e., the inside of an inkjet device, which is warmed to 50° C. or higher in spite of a fact that the curable composition contains a compound having a cyclic ether group; and a method for producing an electronic part using the curable composition for inkjet. Means for Solving the Problems According to a broad aspect of the present invention, a curable composition for inkjet is provided, which can be applied in an inkjet mode, can be cured by the irradiation with light and the application of heat, and comprises a polyfunctional compound having at least two (meth)acryloyl groups, a compound having a cyclic ether group, a heat-curing agent and a color material which cannot be dissolved in the polyfunctional compound and which is dissolved in the curable composition. In a specific aspect of the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention, the heat-curing agent is a viscous reaction product produced by reacting dicyandiamide or a hydrazide compound with a functional-group-containing compound having a functional group capable of reacting with dicyandiamide or the hydrazide compound. In a specific aspect of the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention, the viscosity of the curable composition which is not heated yet is 160 mPa·s or more and 1200 mPa·s or less at 25° C., and the ratio of the viscosity of the curable composition which is heated at 80° C. for 24 hours under an oxygen-free condition to the viscosity of the curable composition which is not heated yet is 1.1 or less, wherein the viscosities are measured in accordance with JIS K2283. In a specific aspect of the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention, the color material can be dissolved in the compound having a cyclic ether group. In a broad aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing an electronic part is provided, which comprises the steps of: applying a curable composition for inkjet as mentioned above in an inkjet mode to draw a pattern; and irradiating the pattern of the curable composition for inkjet with light and then applying heat to the pattern to cure the pattern, thereby forming a cured product layer. Effect of the Invention The curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention comprises a polyfunctional compound having at least two (meth)acryloyl groups, a compound having a cyclic ether group, a heat-curing agent and a color material, the color material cannot be dissolved in the polyfunctional compound and the color material is dissolved in the curable composition. Therefore, the storage stability of the curable composition can be improved. EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described in detail. (Curable Composition for Inkjet) The curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention can be applied in an inkjet mode for use. The curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention comprises a polyfunctional compound having at least two (meth)acryloyl groups (A), a photopolymerization initiator (B), a compound having a cyclic ether group (C), a heat-curing agent (D) and a color material (E). The color material (E) cannot be dissolved in the polyfunctional compound (A), and the color material is dissolved in the curable composition. The term “(meth)acryloyl group” refers to an acryloyl group and a methacryloyl group. Since the curable composition for inkjet has the above-mentioned composition and the above-mentioned color material (E) is used in the curable composition, the storage stability of the curable composition can be improved and the pot life of the curable composition for inkjet can be prolonged satisfactorily even under a condition, i.e., the inside of an inkjet device which is warmed to 50° C. or higher. Further, even when the curable composition for inkjet which is not applied in an inkjet mode yet is warmed to 50° C. or higher, the viscosity of the curable composition is rarely increased and the heat-curing of the curable composition hardly proceeds. Therefore, the curable composition for inkjet has excellent storage stability under high temperature conditions and can be ejected through an inkjet nozzle stably. The present inventors have found that, when a curable composition for inkjet comprises a polyfunctional compound (A), a photopolymerization initiator (B), a compound having a cyclic ether group (C) and a heat-curing agent (D) and additionally comprises a color material (E) which cannot be dissolved in the polyfunctional compound (A) and is dissolved in the curable composition, the storage stability of the curable composition for inkjet is increased. The curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention can be cured by the irradiation with light, because the curable composition contains the polyfunctional compound (A) and the photopolymerization initiator (B). The curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention can also be cured by the application of heat, because the curable composition contains the compound having a cyclic ether group (C) and the heat-curing agent (D). That is, the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention can be cured by the irradiation with light and the application of heat, and is therefore a light-curable and heat-curable composition for inkjet. The curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention can be irradiated with light to produce a primary cured product, and then heat is applied to the primary cured product to cause the main curing of the curable composition. In this manner, a cured product, i.e., a cured product layer such as a resist pattern can be produced. Thus, the wet-spreading of the curable composition for inkjet applied on an application object member, such as a substrate, can be prevented by carrying the primary curing of the curable composition for inkjet by the irradiation with light. Consequently, it becomes possible to form a cured product layer such as a fine resist pattern with high accuracy. Furthermore, since the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention contains particularly the compound having a cyclic ether group (C), the heat resistance of a cured product that is produced by curing the curable composition can be increased. It is preferred that the heat-curing agent (D) is a viscous material rather than a solid material such as particles. For example, the heat-curing agent (D) is preferably a viscous reaction product produced by reacting dicyandiamide or a hydrazide compound with a functional-group-containing compound having a functional group capable of reacting with dicyandiamide or the hydrazide compound. When the viscous reaction product is used, the inkjet ejection properties can be further improved. Hereinbelow, the components contained in the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention will be described in detail. [Polyfunctional Compound (A)] For the purpose of curing the curable composition for inkjet by the irradiation with light, the curable composition contains a polyfunctional compound having at least two (meth)acryloyl groups (A). The polyfunctional compound (A) is not particularly limited, as long as at least two (meth)acryloyl groups are contained. As the polyfunctional compound (A), a conventional known polyfunctional compound having at least two (meth)acryloyl groups can be used. Since the polyfunctional compound (A) has at least two (meth)acryloyl groups, the polymerization proceeds upon the irradiation with light and consequently the curable composition is cured. Thus, the curing of the curable composition can be allowed to proceed by the irradiation with light, the shape of an applied part can be retained, and the excess wet-spreading of a primary cured product and a cured product of the curable composition which is produced by the irradiation with light can be prevented effectively. As the polyfunctional compound (A), only one type may be used, or a combination of at least two types may also be used.

When the polyfunctional compound (A1) is used, the wet heat resistance of a cured product of the curable composition for inkjet can be increased. Thus, a printed wiring board produced using the curable composition for inkjet can be used for a prolonged period of time, and the reliability of the printed wiring board can be improved. The polyfunctional compound (A1) is not particularly limited, as long as polyfunctional compound (A1) has the polycyclic skeleton and also has at least two (meth)acryloyl groups. As the polyfunctional compound (A1), a conventional known polyfunctional compound having a polycyclic skeleton and also having at least two (meth)acryloyl groups can be used. The polymerization of the polyfunctional compound (A1) can proceed to cure the polyfunctional compound (A1) upon the irradiation with light, since the polyfunctional compound (A1) has at least two (meth)acryloyl groups.

When the polyfunctional compound (A1) and the below-mentioned monofunctional compound (G) are used in combination, it is preferred that the content of the polyfunctional compound (A1) is 20% by weight or more and 70% by weight or less relative to the total content, i.e., 100% by weight, of the polyfunctional compound (A1), the monofunctional compound (G) and the photopolymerization initiator (B). In 100% by weight of the curable composition for inkjet, the content of the polyfunctional compound (A1) is more preferably 40% by weight or more, and more preferably 60% by weight or less. When the content of the polyfunctional compound (A1) is equal to or more than the lower limit, the curable composition can be cured more effectively by the irradiation with light. When the content of the polyfunctional compound (A1) is equal to or lower than the upper limit, the wet heat resistance of the cured product can be further improved. [Photopolymerization Initiator (B)] For the purpose of curing the curable composition for inkjet by the irradiation with light, it is preferred that the curable composition for inkjet also contains a photopolymerization initiator (B) in addition to the polyfunctional compound (A).

The photo-radical polymerization initiator is preferably an α-aminoalkylphenone-type photo-radical polymerization initiator, and more preferably an α-aminoalkylphenone-type photo-radical polymerization initiator having a dimethylamino group. When any one of the specific photo-radical polymerization initiators is used, it becomes possible to photo-cure the curable composition for inkjet with high efficiency even when the amount of exposure light is small. The wet-spreading of the applied curable composition for inkjet can be prevented effectively by the irradiation with light, and consequently a fine resist pattern can be formed with high accuracy. When the photo-radical polymerization initiator is an α-aminoalkylphenone-type photopolymerization initiator having a dimethylamino group, the heat curing rate can be increased and consequently the heat curability of the light irradiation product of the composition can become good. Specific examples of the α-aminoalkylphenone-type photo-radical polymerization initiator include IRGACURE 907, IRGACURE 369, IRGACURE 379 and IRGACURE 379EG which are products manufactured by BASF.

[Compound Having Cyclic Ether Group (C)] For the purpose of enabling the curable composition for inkjet to be cured by the application of heat, the curable composition for inkjet contains a compound having a cyclic ether group (C). When the compound (C) is used, it becomes possible to further cure the curable composition or the primary cured product of the curable composition by the application of heat.

Furthermore, a compound having an aromatic skeleton and a cyclic ether group has excellent compatibility with the polyfunctional compound (A), the monofunctional compound (G) and the curing agent (C) compared with a compound having no aromatic skeleton and having a cyclic ether group, and therefore insulation reliability can be further improved.

In this case, the pot life of the composition is good. Therefore, the heat-curing agent (D) is preferably a viscous reaction product produced by reacting dicyandiamide or a hydrazide compound with a functional-group-containing compound having a functional group capable of reacting with dicyandiamide or the hydrazide compound.

Therefore, an electronic part, such as a printed wiring board, which is manufactured using the curable composition for inkjet can be used for a longer period of time and the reliability of the electronic part is further improved. Furthermore, when the monofunctional compound (G) is used, the wet heat resistance of the cured product can be improved and the ejection properties of the curable composition can also be improved. When a monofunctional compound (G) having a polycyclic skeleton and also having one (meth)acryloyl group is used, the wet heat resistance of the cured product can become higher compared with the case in which a monofunctional compound having no polycyclic skeleton and having one (meth)acryloyl group is used. The monofunctional compound (G) is not limited particularly, as long as the monofunctional compound (G) has a polycyclic skeleton and also has one (meth)acryloyl group. As the monofunctional compound (G), a conventional known monofunctional compound having a polycyclic skeleton and also having one (meth)acryloyl group can be used. As the monofunctional compound (G), only one type may be used, or a combination of at least two types may also be used.

When the content of the monofunctional compound (G) is equal to or lower than the upper limit, the curable composition can be cured more effectively by the irradiation with light. The upper limit of the total content of the polyfunctional compound (A1) and the monofunctional compound (G) in 100% by weight of the curable composition for inkjet is properly controlled depending on the content of the photopolymerization initiator (B).

In the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention, it is preferred that the viscosity η1 as measured at 25° C. in accordance with JIS K2283 is 160 mPa·s or more and 1200 mPa·s or less. When the viscosity η1 of the curable composition for inkjet is equal to or more than the lower limit and is equal to or lower than the upper limit, the curable composition for inkjet can be ejected through an inkjet head easily and with high accuracy. Furthermore, when the curable composition for inkjet is warmed to 50° C. or higher, the composition can also be ejected through an inkjet head easily and with high accuracy. The viscosity η1 is more preferably 1000 mPa·s or less, still more preferably 500 mPa·s or less. When the viscosity satisfies the above-mentioned preferred upper limit, the ejection properties of the curable composition can become better upon the continuous ejection through the head. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of the further prevention of the wet-spreading of the curable composition and the further improvement in resolution in the formation of the cured product layer, the viscosity is preferably more than 500 mPa·s. The ratio (η2/η1) of the viscosity η2 of the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention, which is measured after heating the curable composition at 80° C. for 24 hours under an oxygen-free condition, to the above-mentioned viscosity η1 is preferably 1.1 or less, more preferably 1.05 or less, particularly preferably 1.025 or less. When the ratio (η2/η1) is equal to or lower than the upper limit, the storage stability of the curable composition is high and the pot life of the curable composition is sufficiently long. Although the ratio (η2/η1) is generally 1 or more, the ratio (η2/η1) may be 0.95 or more. The viscosity η2 can be measured in the same manner as for the viscosity η1.

The content of the organic solvent is more preferably 20 parts by weight or less, still more preferably 10 parts by weight or less, particularly preferably 1 part by weight or less, relative to 100 parts by weight of the heat-curing agent (D). The less the content of the organic solvent is, the better the resolution in the formation of the cured product layer is. (Method for Manufacturing Electronic Part) Hereinbelow, the method for producing an electronic part according to the present invention will be described. In the method for producing the electronic part according to the present invention, the above-mentioned curable composition for inkjet is used. That is, in the method for producing the electronic part according to the present invention, the curable composition for inkjet is firstly applied in an inkjet mode to draw a pattern. In this procedure, it is particularly preferred that the curable composition for inkjet is applied directly to form the pattern. The term “applied directly” refers to a matter that the curable composition is applied without using a mask to draw the pattern. Examples of the electronic part include a printed wiring board and a touch panel part. The electronic part is preferably a wiring board, and is more preferably a printed wiring board. For the application of the curable composition for inkjet, an inkjet printer is used. The inkjet printer is equipped with an inkjet head. The inkjet head has a nozzle. An inkjet device is preferably equipped with a warming unit for warming the inside of the inkjet device or the inside of the inkjet head to a temperature of 50° C. or higher. It is preferred that the curable composition for inkjet is applied onto an application object member. An example of the application object member is a substrate. An example of the substrate is a substrate having a wiring line or the like formed on the upper surface thereof. It is preferred that the curable composition for inkjet is applied onto a printed circuit board. According to the method for producing the electronic part according to the present invention, it is possible to produce a glass substrate for a display device such as a liquid crystal display device using, instead of the substrate, a member mainly composed of a glass. Specifically, it is also possible to form electrically conductive patterns such as an ITO on a glass by a method such as a deposition method and then form a cured product layer on the electrically conductive patterns in an inkjet mode by the method for producing the electronic part according to the present invention. When the patterns are formed with an electrically conductive ink or the like on the cured product layer, the cured product layer serves as an insulation film and electric connection can be achieved between given patterns among the electrically conductive patterns on the glass. Subsequently, the curable composition for inkjet that is applied in a pattern-like form is irradiated with light and then applied with heat to cure the curable composition, thereby forming a cured product layer. In this manner, an electronic part having the cured product layer can be produced. The cured product layer may be an insulation film or a resist pattern. The insulation film may be a pattern-like insulation film. The cured product layer is preferably a resist pattern. The resist pattern is preferably a solder resist pattern. The method for producing the electronic part according to the present invention is preferably a method for producing a printed wiring board having a resist pattern. It is preferred that the curable composition for inkjet is applied in an inkjet mode to draw patterns, the curable composition for inkjet that is applied in a pattern-like form is irradiated with light and then applied with heat to cure the curable composition, thereby forming a resist pattern. It may also be possible to irradiate the curable composition for inkjet that is applied in a pattern-like form with light to cause the primary curing of the curable composition, thereby producing a primary cured product. In this case, the wet-spreading of the applied curable composition for inkjet can be prevented and highly precise resist patterns can be formed. When a primary curing product is produced by the irradiation with light, it may be possible to carry out the main curing by applying heat to the primary cured product to produce a cured product, thereby forming a cured product layer such as a resist pattern. The curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention can be cured by the irradiation with light and the application of heat. When the curing with light and the curing by heat are used in combination, a cured product layer, such as a resist pattern, having superior heat resistance can be formed. The temperature to be employed for the curing by the application of heat is preferably 100° C. or higher, more preferably 120° C. or higher, and preferably 250° C. or lower, more preferably 200° C. or lower. The irradiation with light may be carried out after the drawing of the pattern, or may be carried out simultaneously with the drawing of the pattern. For example, the irradiation with light may be carried out simultaneously with or immediately after the ejection of the curable composition. For the purpose of carrying out the irradiation with light simultaneously with the drawing of the pattern, it may be possible to place a light source at such a position that a light-irradiated part can be positioned at a drawing position by means of an inkjet head. The light source to be employed for the irradiation with light can be properly selected depending on the light to be employed for the irradiation. Examples of the light source include an UV-LED, a low-pressure mercury lamp, a medium-pressure mercury lamp, a high-pressure mercury lamp, an ultrahigh-pressure mercury lamp, a xenon lamp and a metal halide lamp. The light to be employed for the irradiation is generally ultraviolet ray, and may also be electron beam, α-ray, β-ray, γ-ray, X-ray, neutron ray or the like. The temperature to be employed in the application of the curable composition for inkjet is not particularly limited, as long as the curable composition for inkjet can have such a viscosity that the curable composition can be ejected through an inkjet head at that temperature. The temperature to be employed in the application of the curable composition for inkjet is preferably 50° C. or higher, more preferably 60° C. or higher, and preferably 100° C. or lower. The viscosity of the curable composition for inkjet during application is not particularly limited, as long as the curable composition can be ejected through an inkjet head at the viscosity. It may also be possible to employ a method of cooling the substrate during printing. When the substrate is cooled, the viscosity of the curable composition during spotting can be increased and, consequently, the resolution can be improved. In this case, it is preferred that the cooling is carried out to such an extent that dew drops cannot be formed or, alternatively, the atmospheric air is dehumidified so as to prevent the formation of dew drops. The dimensional accuracy may be corrected, since the substrate shrinks upon cooling. When a viscous material such as the above-mentioned viscous reaction product is used as the heat-curing agent (D), even if the curable composition for inkjet is heated in the inkjet head, the pot life of the curable composition for inkjet can become sufficiently long and, therefore, stably ejection of the curable composition can be achieved. Furthermore, since the curable composition for inkjet can be heated to such an extent that the curable composition has a viscosity suitable for the application in an inkjet mode, it becomes possible to suitably manufacture an electronic part such as a printed wiring board using the curable composition for inkjet according to the present invention.

For the purpose of forming a pattern using each of the curable compositions for inkjet, each of the curable compositions for inkjet was ejected and applied onto the substrate through an inkjet head of a piezo-type inkjet printer equipped with an ultraviolet ray irradiation device in such a manner that the line width became 80 μm and the line spacing became 80 μm. The length of pot life was determined from the ejection properties through the inkjet head on the basis of the determination criteria shown below. In the ejection test on some of the curable compositions for inkjet each of which had a viscosity of 500 mPa·s or less, the head temperature was set to 80° C. In the ejection test on some of the curable compositions for inkjet each of which had a viscosity of more than 500 mPa·s, the head temperature was set to 95° C. [Determination Criteria for Pot Life] ◯◯: The composition could be ejected through the inkjet head. ◯: The curing of the composition slightly proceeded before the ejection, or the composition could be ejected through the inkjet head although the viscosity of the composition was slightly increased. Δ: The composition was cured before the ejection, or the viscosity of the composition was increased and the composition could not be ejected through the inkjet head. ×: The composition was cured to a large degree. (6) Heat Resistance A copper-foil-attached FR-4 substrate which had a copper foil attached on the upper surface thereof was provided. Each of the curable compositions for inkjet was ejected and applied onto the copper foil of the substrate through an inkjet head of a piezo-type inkjet printer equipped with an ultraviolet ray irradiation device at a line width of 80 μm and a line spacing of 80 μm in such a manner that each of the curable compositions covered the surface of the copper foil, thereby drawing a pattern. In the ejection test on some of the curable compositions for inkjet each of which had a viscosity of 500 mPa·s or less, the head temperature was set to 80° C. In the ejection test on some of the curable compositions for inkjet each of which had a viscosity of more than 500 mPa·s, the head temperature was set to 95° C. Each of the curable compositions for inkjet (thickness: 20 μm), which was applied in a pattern-like form, was irradiated with ultraviolet ray having a wavelength of 365 nm in such a manner that the irradiation energy became 1000 mJ/cm2, thereby producing a primary cured product. Subsequently, the primary cured product was heated at 150° C. for 60 minutes to cause the main curing of each of the curable compositions, thereby producing a resist pattern which was a main cured product. The resultant laminate of the substrate and the resist pattern was heated in an oven at 270° C. for 5 minutes, and subsequently the appearance of the heated resist pattern was inspected with naked eyes. Thereafter, a cellophane tape was adhered to the heated resist pattern, and then the cellophane tape was peeled in the 90 degree direction. The heat resistance was determined by the appearance test and the peel test on the basis of the criteria shown below. [Determination Criteria for Heat Resistance] ◯: No change was observed in the resist pattern before and after the heating in the appearance test, and the resist pattern was not detached from the substrate in the peel test. ×: At least one phenomenon selected from cracking, detachment and blistering was observed in the resist pattern in the appearance test, or the resist pattern was detached from the substrate in the peel test. (7) Evaluation of Solubility 2 of Color Material in Curable Composition A portion (100 g) of each of the curable compositions for inkjet produced in Examples and Comparative Examples was provided. The portion (100 g) of each of the curable compositions for inkjet was filtered through a mesh filter having a diameter of 1 cm and a mesh size of 1 μm at 100 hPa, and the solubility 2 of a color material in each of the curable compositions was determined on the basis of the criteria shown below. [Determination Criteria for Solubility 2 of Color Material in Curable Composition] ◯◯: The curable material could be filtered within 1 minute. ◯: The curable material could be filtered within a time range of longer than 1 minute and 3 minutes or shorter. Δ: The curable material could be filtered within a time range of longer than 3 minutes and 5 minutes or shorter. ×: The curable material could not be filtered within 5 minutes. The results are shown in Tables 2 to 6. In the results, unheated curable compositions for inkjet were used in evaluations other than the evaluation of the viscosities η2 and the evaluation of pot lives. TABLE 2 Product Nos.
