Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
(R)-3-(2-(((1-Fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methyl aniline (0.35 g, 1.48 mmol) and 4-bromo-2,6-difluorobenzaldehyde (0.33 g, 1.48 mmol) in a mixture of H2O (0.13 mL, 7.40 mmol) and acetic acid (5.79 mL) were heated at 80° C. for 7 hours. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was treated with HCl (1N, 10 mL) and was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. To the reaction was added solid Na2CO3 until the reaction pH was 8. The mixture was diluted with H2O (40 mL) and extracted twice with EtOAc (2×50 mL). The organic phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered, concentrated and was purified by silica chromatography (10 to 70% EtOAc in heptanes) to afford (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.285 g, 44%) as a pale yellow gum.
