Example 361A
3-Methylbut-3-en-1-yl 1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-3-(3-methylbut-3-en-1-yl)-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate
To a solution of 450 mg (1.43 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 18A in 15 ml of DMF were added 1.39 g (4.27 mmol) of caesium carbonate, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. Then 670 mg (4.27 mmol) of 4-bromo-2-methylbut-1-ene were added, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 113 h. The reaction mixture was then partitioned between semisaturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (70 ml) and ethyl acetate (70 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was chromatographed on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate eluent). 300 mg (47% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
