Intermediate Synthesis 4: Synthesis of Intermediate 4
Under an argon atmosphere, a mixture of 2.79 g (14.6 mmol) of CuI and 2.5 g (22.0 mmol) of trans-1,2-cyclohexanediamine in 140 ml of dioxane was stirred for one hour at room temperature. After adding 13.6 g (40.6 mmol) of the intermediate 3, 9.9 g (48.5 mmol) of iodobenzene, and 21.7 g (102.3 mmol) of tripotassium phosphate, the mixture was stirred at 90Â° C. for 2 h under heating.
After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the precipitated crystal was collected by filtration. The crystal was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain 13.4 g (yield: 80%) of a white solid, which was identified as the following intermediate 4 by FD-MS analysis.
