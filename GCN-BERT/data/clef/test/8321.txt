The invention more particularly relates to fixed dose combination of solid dispersion Containing artemether and lumefantrine and to continuous process for fixed dose combination of solid dispersion containing artemether and lumefantrine using hot melt extrusion technology. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART: Hot-melt extrusion (ΗΜΕ) is one of the most widely used processing techniques within the plastics industry. Hot-melt extrusion is the process of pumping raw materials with a rotating screw under elevated temperature through a die into a product of uniform shape. Today, the interest in ΗΜΕ techniques for pharmaceutical applications is growing rapidly as many as 40% of all new molecular entities have poor bioavailability because of low aqueous solubility. Formulation of such compounds for oral delivery possess one of the most frequent and formidable challenges to formulation scientists. ΗΜΕ has been used to improve the bio^vailability of drug substances especially those having low water solubility by formation of molecular dispersions. There is ample literature available on ΗΜΕ platform techniques applied in pharmaceutical industries. ΕΡ1302201 describes a pharmaceutical composition for oral use with improved absorption, which comprises drug, aminoalkyl mehtacrylate copolymer Ε and acidic substance, where all the three components are brought together and at least the above- mentioned polymer and above-mentioned acidic substance are uniformly mixed. Among the Jong list of possibly suitable acidic substances also Cl 2-C18 mono carboxylic acids like for instance stearic acid are mentioned. In the examples hydrochloric acid (HCI), citric acid, malic acid and tartaric acid are combined with EUDRAGIT® Ε or EUDRAGIT® ΕΡΟ. US 7,175,857 (W02004/019918) describes a process for the production of granules or powders, suitable ¾s coating agents and binders for oral or dermal pharmaceutical forms, for cosmetics or food supplements, consisting essentially of (a) a copolymer, consisting of free radical-polymerized Ci- to C4-esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which contain functional tertiary amino groups, (b) 3 to 25% by weight, based on (a), of an emulsifier having an HLB of at least 14, (c) 5 to 50% by weight, based on (a), of a Ci2- to Ci8-monocarboxylic acid or of a Ci2- to Ci8-hydroxyl compound, where the components (a), (b) and (c) are simultaneously or successively blended or mixed with one another, optionally with addition of a pharmaceutical active compound and/or further customary additives, fused in a heatable mixer, mixed, the melt is cooled and comminute to give granules or powders. The examples describe the melt extrusion of mixtures of EUDRAGIT® Ε with stearic acid and sodium lauryl sulfate. US20060051412A1 (W02004066976A1) describes a method for producing an oral pharmaceutical form with immediate disintegration and active ingredient release even in the mouth, by vigorously mixing (a) an anionic active pharmaceutical ingredient with (b) a copolymer consisting of free-radical polymerized Ci to C4 esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and further (meth)acrylate monomers which have functional tertiary amino groups, and (c) 5 to 50% by weight, based on (b), of a C12 to C22 carboxylic acid in the melt, solidifying the mixture and grinding to an active ingredient- containing powder with an average particle size of 200 pm or less, incorporating the powder into a water soluble matrix of pharmaceutically customary excipients, with the proviso that not more than 3% by weight, based on the copolymer, of emulsifiers having an HLB of at least 14 may be present. The examples describe the melt extrusion of mixtures of ibuprofen, EUDRAGIT® Ε and stearic acid. The invention is based on the interaction of the anionic active ingredients with the cationic ingredients. W02008/067164A2 describes solid pharmaceutical dosage forms comprising a solid dispersion or solid solution of ritonavir in a matrix. The matrix comprises at least one pharmaceutical acceptable water-soluble polymer selected from N-vinyl pyrrolidone, however a lot of other polymers among them butyl methacrylate/2- dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate copolymers are also mentioned to be suitable and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant having an HLB value of from 12 to 18. The preferred technique to produce the solid dispersion or solid solution of ritonavir in the matrix is melt extrusion at temperature in the range of 70 to 250 °C. A cursory review of the literature indicates that the use of hot-melt extrusion (ΗΜΕ) within the pharmaceutical industry is steadily increasing, due to its proven ability to efficiently manufacture novel products. ΗΜΕ involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation through an extrusion channel to mix materials together, and subsequently forcing them out through a die. ΗΜΕ extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier, increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. Thus solid dispersion approach by ΗΜΕ is known to be one of the most promising approaches to improve the oral bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs. The antimalarial drugs selected from the group consisting of artemether, lumefantrine, artesunate, amodiaquine or their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts, enantiomers, derivatives, polymorphs, prodrugs, solvates or hydrates or combinations thereof or mixtures of these active ingredients belong to BCS class IV (low solubility and low permeability). Artemether and lumefantrine are antimalarial drugs used for the treatment of a subject infected by Plasmodium falciparum. Artemether is poorly soluble in water while lumefantrine is practically insoluble in water and hence possess bioavailability issues. Therefore, research community has tried to improve the aqueous solubility of Artemether using solid dispersions and inclusion complexes. The reported solid dispersions of dihydroartemisinin are prepared using polyvinylpyrrolidone and PEG-4000. Artemether-lumefantrine is an ACT widely used nowadays and consists of a registered fixed dose combination of artemether (20 mg) and lumefantrine (120 mg) in tablets. The rationale is that artemether will rapidly reduce parasitemia, resulting in symptomatic relief, and lumefantrine will eliminate the remaining parasites. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends this association as first line therapy for falciparum malaria in endemic areas. Both the drugs belong to BCS class IV (low solubility and low permeability). Further, both drugs have pH independent solubility and vast differences in respective melting points i.e. artemether (90°C) and lumefantrine (130°C). Therefore, it is a challenge to the pharmacist to develop an improved and innovative immediate release formulation containing artemether and lumefantrine in fixed dose form. Further, developing an appropriate method of manufacturing solid dispersions of two poorly soluble and practically insoluble drugs has been a lingering challenge to the pharmacist. The prior art failed to teach fixed dose combination artemether and lumefantrine with improved solubility and dissolution rate. Therefore, there is a need in the art to provide an efficient solid dispersion comprising combination of Artemether and lumefantrine with high aqueous solubility and improved dissolution rate, suitable for inclusion in solid dosage, forms such as capsules, tablets and the like. Accordingly the object of the instant invention is to provide composition comprising solid dispersion consisting of a combination of Artemether and lumefantrine with high aqueous solubility and improved dissolution rate using hot melt extrusion technology. Summary of the invention: In accordance with the above objective, the present invention provides fixed dose combination of antimalarial drugs belonging to BCS class IV (low solubility and low permeability), having different solubility and physicochemical characteristics that is extruded using single polymer under optimized parameters with the help of hot melt extrusion technique. The antimalarial drugs according to the invention is selected from the group consisting of artemether, lumefantrine, artesunate, amodiaquine or their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts, enantiomers, derivatives, polymorphs, prodrugs, solvates or hydrates or combinations thereof. In a preferred aspect, the antimalarial drugs as referred herein above are preferably Artemether and lumefantrine, having pH independent solubility. In a preferred aspect, the invention utilizes hot melt extrusion technique to prepare a solid dispersion to improve the solubility and physicochemical properties. Accordingly the solid dispersion comprising Artemether, lumefantrine together with Soluplus® and a surfactant selected from PEG 400 or Lutrol® FI27 (poloxomer 407) or Lutrol® F68 (poloxomer 188). Solid dispersions (SD) were prepared using hot melt extrusion in the ratios of 1:1,1:2 and 1:3 respectively. Soluplus is a novel polymer composed of polyvinyl caprolactam - polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene glycol graft copolymer.

A diagram of a typical single screw extruder is shown in Figure. 1. Generally, the extruder as used in the instant invention consists of at least one rotating screw inside a stationary cylindrical barrel. The barrel is often manufactured in sections, which are bolted or clamped together. An end-plate die, connected to the end of the barrel, determines the shape of the extruded product. Standard process control and monitoring devices include zone temperature and screw speed with optional monitoring of torque, drive amperage, and pressure and melt viscosity. Temperatures are normally controlled by electrical heating bands and monitored by thermocouples. The major differences between a plastics extruder and a pharmaceutical-class extruder are the contact parts, which must meet regulatory requirements. Typically, the metallurgy of the contact parts must not to be reactive, additive or absorptive with the product. In addition, the equipment is configured for the cleaning and validation requirements associated with a pharmaceutical environment. Otherwise, the unit operations performed for a pharmaceutical product is virtually identical to a polymer extrusion process. According to the preferred embodiment, the invention provides fixed dose combination of Artemether-Lumefantrine in the form of solid dispersion and the process for preparation of solid dispersion using hot melt extrusion technique. Solid dispersions were prepared by hot melt extrusion in a single screw hot melt extruder (SB Panchal and Company, India, as shown in fig 1). Extrusion parameters were adjusted for both drug and are summarized in Table I. As per literature, the extrusion of two drugs in fixed dose combination using single polymer has not been reported yet. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical dosage form comprising one or more antimalarial drug(s) belong(s) to the BCS class II or to the BCS class IV in the form of a solid dispersion or solid solution in a matrix, wherein said matrix comprises a polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer along with a surfactant. In a preferred embodiment, the solid dispersion comprises the combination of Artemether-Lumefantrine together with Soluplus® and surfactants. Soluplus is a novel polymer composed of polyvinyl caprolactam - polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene glycol graft copolymer and the surfactant is selected from the group consisting of PEG 400 or Lutrol® F127 (poloxomer 407) or Lutrol® F68 (poloxomer 188). The use of surfactants causes the processing of extrusion easier and smooth. The content of polymer used in the solid dispersion is at least 47 % (wt./wt.), based on the total weight of the dosage form. The active ingredient is in the state of an amorphous particulate state of a solid dispersion or solid solution. Although, the invention is demonstrated with the combination of Artemether-Lumefantrine, however, the inventive solid dispersion and the process of preparing the same using ΗΜΕ technique is also applicable and scalable for other antimalarial drugs such as artesunate, amodiaquine or their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salts, enantiomers, derivatives, polymorphs, prodrugs, solvates or hydrates or combinations thereof or mixtures of these active ingredients. In another preferred embodiment, the invention provides process for preparation of solid dispersion comprising the combination of Artemether-Lumefantrine using hot melt extrusion technique. The hot melt extrusion process for preparation of the solid dispersion comprising the steps of: (a) hot-melt extruding a mass comprising the pharmacologically active ingredient artemether- lumefantrine and polymer with surfactant, through a circular die at a temperature of 50 to 180 °C thereby obtaining a melt extrude with a circular cross-section; and (b) Cutting said extrude into cylindrical having two opposing cut surfaces of oblong shape to obtain melt-extruded particles. The above process is continuous and solvent free and can be performed by means of a single-screw-extruder or double-screw-extruder. The morphological orientation melt-extruded particles caused by hot-melt extrusion are substantially orthogonal to the transversal direction of extension of the dosage form. The “solid dispersion (s)” or “melt-extruded particles” thus obtained exhibit breaking strength of at least 300 Ν. For purpose of the present invention, the term “solid dispersion (s) and “melt-extruded particles” shall refer to a plutality of units, In this regard, the melt extruded particles will be of a range of from about 0.1 to about 100 mm in length and have a diameter of from about ο.1 to about 5 mm. In addition, it is to be understood that the melt extruded particles thus obtained can be any geometrical shape within this such as beads, microspheres, seeds, pellets, etc. The melt extruded particles or multiparticulates thus obtained can thereafter be included in a capsule or tablets or in any other suitable pharmaceutical solid dosage forms. In yet another preferred embodiment, the invention provides dissolution studies of various embodiments prepared in accordance with the invention. In various embodiments, the invention provides different formulations of solid dispersions prepared in accordance with the process, are shown in Table 1.

Thus in a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical dosage form comprising: 25 to 50% by weight of artemether, 25 to 50 % by weight of lumefantrine, 50 - 75 % by weight of polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer (USP/NF), 2-5 % by weight of surfactants and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The following examples, which include preferred embodiments, will serve to illustrate the practice of this invention, it being understood that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purpose of illustrative discussion of preferred embodiments of the invention. Solid dispersions and solid solutions The term solid dispersion defines a solid state system comprising at least two components wherein one component is dispersed throughout the other component or components. In the sense of the present invention one or more antimalarial active ingredients are dispersed in a matrix, wherein said matrix comprises a polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer. The dispersion may be a purely physical uniformly distribution of the one or more antiretroviral active ingredients in the matrix, which means the active ingredient is present in'the crystallized form as it was before it was mixed into the matrix structure. The still crystallized form of the active ingredient may be proven by X-ray differential scanning analysis. Particles of the active ingredient in crystal structures may be proven by scanning electron microscopy. The dispersion may be a physical uniformly distribution of the one or more antimalarial active ingredients in the matrix, wherein the active ingredient is the state of an amorphous particulate state of a solid dispersion. This means that the active ingredient has been transited from a crystallized state to a higher energy non-crystallized or amorphous state. The ηοηcrystallized form of the active ingredient may be proven by X-ray differential scanning analysis and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) which shows an altered spectrum. Particles of the active ingredient in non-crystal structures may be proven by scanning electron microscopy. The mean size of such particles, measured in length or in diameter, may be typically less than 200 pm in size, for instance not more than 100, not more than 10 or not more than 5 pm. The dispersion may be a physical and chemically uniformly distribution of the one or more antimalarial active ingredients in the matrix on the molecular level, which is called a solid solution. This means that the active ingredient has been transited from a crystallized state to a higher energy non-crystallized, molecular state. Pharmaceutical dosage forms wherein the active ingredient is the state of a solid dispersion in an amorphous particulate state is most preferred. In contrast to the solid dispersion state where the active ingredient is still present in comparably low energy but highly stable crystal form the solubility and thus the bioavailability of the active ingredient is increased in a solid dispersion in an amorphous particulate state. Stability studies The hot melt extruded FDC SD formulations were kept under stability studies as per ICH guidelines for 6 months and the analysed by HPLC method. HPLC method of analyses The assay of the melt extrudates was assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) apparatus equipped with a quipped with Binary HPLC pump, and 2998 UV Array detector (Agilent Corporation, Milford, Massachusetts). A reversephase Cl8 column (150 χ 4.6 mm; 5 pm particles) was used. The mobile phase acetonitrile; 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid buffer adjusted to pH 2.34 (60:40%, ν/ν) was used as the mobile phases with flow rate 1.0 ml/min, injection volume 20μ1. Samples equivalent to 20 mg of Artemether and 120 mg of LUMF from FDC SD were dissolved in 5 mL of methanol and appropriately diluted and the drug content was determined by HPLC at λ = 210 nm.

The intensity counts range and wavelength for all FDC SD formulations found to be in the same region indicates the uniform distribution of drug within the polymer matrix. Fig. 10 SEM of pure Artemether and Lumefantrine shows large, needle shaped structures with relatively smooth surface morphology Fig. 10Α SEM of FDC SD formulations containing PEG 400 (FI), Lutrol® F127 (F4) and Lutrol® F68 (F7) demonstrates reduction in the particle size as compared to individual crystalline drug forms with small, disordered structures with relatively rough surface morphology. This indicated the miscibility of drug inside polymer matrix. WE CLAIM, 1.
