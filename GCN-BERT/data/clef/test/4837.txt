TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to a liquid crystal compound, a liquid crystal composition and a liquid crystal display device. More specifically, the invention relates to a tricyclic compound having a plurality of CF2O bonding groups, a liquid crystal composition containing the compound and having a nematic phase, and a liquid crystal display device using the composition. BACKGROUND ART A liquid crystal display device is widely utilized for a display of a personal computer, a television and so forth. The display device utilizes dielectric anisotropy, optical anisotropy or the like of a liquid crystal compound. As an operating mode of the display device, various modes are known, such as a phase change (PC) mode, a twisted nematic (TN) mode, a super twisted nematic (STN) mode, a bistable twisted nematic (BTN) mode, an electrically controlled birefringence (ECB) mode, an optically compensated bend (OCB) mode, an in-plane switching (IPS) mode, a vertical alignment (VA) mode and a polymer sustained alignment (PSA) mode. In such a liquid crystal display device, a liquid crystal composition having suitable physical properties is used. In order to further improve characteristics of the display device, the liquid crystal compound contained in the composition preferably has physical properties as shown in (1) to (8) below: (1) high stability to heat, light and so forth; (2) high clearing point; (3) low minimum temperature of a liquid crystal phase; (4) small viscosity (η); (5) large value of dielectric anisotropy (Δ∈); (6) suitable value of optical anisotropy (Δn); (7) suitable elastic constant (K); and (8) excellent compatibility with other liquid crystal compounds. An effect of the physical properties of the liquid crystal compound on the characteristics of the liquid crystal display device is as described below. A compound having a high stability to heat, light and so forth as described in (1) increases a voltage holding ratio of a device. Thus, a service life of the display device becomes long. A compound having a high clearing point as described in (2) extends a temperature range in which the device can be used. A compound having a low minimum temperature of a liquid crystal phase such as a nematic phase or a smectic phase as described in (3), particularly, a compound having a low minimum temperature of the nematic phase also extends the temperature range in which the device can be used. A compound having a small viscosity as described in (4) shortens a response time of the device. A compound showing a large dielectric anisotropy as described in (5) decreases a threshold voltage of the display device. Thus, an electric power consumption of the display device becomes small. As is well known, the threshold voltage (Vth) is expressed by an equation as described below (H. J. Deuling, et al., Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., 27 (1975), 81). [in-line-formulae]Vth=π(K/∈0Δ∈)1/2 [/in-line-formulae] In the equation, K is an elastic constant of a liquid crystal material, and ∈0 is a dielectric constant of vacuum. A compound showing a suitable optical anisotropy as described in (6) improves a contrast of the display device. According to a design of the display device, a compound showing a large optical anisotropy or small optical anisotropy, more specifically, a compound showing a suitable optical anisotropy is required. When a response time is shortened by decreasing a cell gap of the display device, a compound showing a large optical anisotropy is suitable. With regard to (7), a compound having a large elastic constant shortens a response time of the display device, and a compound having a small elastic constant decreases a threshold voltage of the display device. Accordingly, a suitable elastic constant is required according to characteristics to be desirably improved. A compound having excellent compatibility with other liquid crystal compounds as described in (8) is preferred. The reason is that such a compound is useful in view of adjusting physical properties of a liquid crystal composition by mixing two or more kinds of liquid crystal compounds having different physical properties. Various kinds of liquid crystal compounds showing a large dielectric anisotropy and a large optical anisotropy have been synthesized so far, and some of the compounds have been put in practical use. For example, Patent literature Nos. 1 to 3 disclose a compound having a CF2O bonding group. However, the compounds have an insufficiently high value of dielectric anisotropy in view of requirements of a marketplace. Therefore, when a liquid crystal composition containing each of the compounds is prepared, Vth cannot be sufficiently decreased in view of the requirements of the marketplace. Furthermore, Patent literature Nos. 4 to 5 discloses a tricyclic compound (compounds (S-1) to (S-2)) having two CF2O bonding groups. However, compound (S-1) has a low phase transition temperature between a liquid crystal phase and an isotropic phase, and compound (S-2) has a small value of optical anisotropy. Moreover, Patent literature Nos. 6 to 7 disclose a pentacyclic compound having two CF2O bonding groups (compounds (S-3) to (S-4)). However, the compounds (S-3) to (S-4) have an insufficiently small viscosity in view of requirements of a marketplace. CITATION LIST Patent Literature Patent literature No. 1: WO 96/011897 A.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, a tricyclic compound having a plurality of CF2O bonding groups, a liquid crystal composition containing the compound, and a liquid crystal display device including the liquid crystal composition according to the present invention will be explained in detail with showing specific examples. Usage of terms herein is as described below. “Liquid crystal compound” is a generic term for a compound having a liquid crystal phase such as a nematic phase or a smectic phase, and a compound having no liquid crystal phase but being useful as a component of the liquid crystal composition. “Liquid crystal display device” is a generic term for a liquid crystal display panel and a liquid crystal display module. “Liquid crystal display device” may be occasionally abbreviated as “display device” or “device.” “Clearing point” is one of values of physical properties as measured using a liquid crystal compound per se as a sample, and is a phase transition temperature between the liquid crystal phase (examples: nematic phase or smectic phase) and an isotropic phase in the liquid crystal compound. “Minimum temperature of the liquid crystal phase” is one of the values of physical properties as measured using a liquid crystal compound per se as a sample, and is a phase transition temperature between a crystal phase and the liquid crystal phase (examples: nematic phase or smectic phase) in the liquid crystal compound. “Maximum temperature of the nematic phase” is a phase transition temperature between the nematic phase and the isotropic phase in a liquid crystal composition, or a phase transition temperature between the nematic phase and the isotropic phase (in a liquid crystal compound) as calculated according to an extrapolation method from a measured value of a mixture of the liquid crystal compound and a base liquid crystal, and may be occasionally abbreviated as “maximum temperature.” “Minimum temperature of the nematic phase” is a phase transition temperature between the nematic phase and the crystal phase or between the nematic phase and the smectic phase in a liquid crystal composition, or a phase transition temperature between the nematic phase and the crystal phase or between the nematic phase and the smectic phase (in a liquid crystal compound) as calculated according to an extrapolation method from a measured value of a mixture of the liquid crystal compound and a base liquid crystal, and may be occasionally abbreviated as “minimum temperature.” A compound represented by formula (1) (symbol “i” represents the formula number) may be occasionally abbreviated as “compound (i).” In the explanation of formula (1), ring A1 to ring A3 generically may be occasionally referred to simply as “ring A.” In the explanation of each formula, a symbol such as A1, B1, C1, D1 and E1 each surrounded by a hexagonal shape corresponds to ring A1, ring B1, ring C1, ring D1 and ring E1, respectively. A plurality of R1 are described in different formulas. In the compounds, two groups represented by two of arbitrary R1 may be identical or different. The rule also applies to a symbol such as ring A1 and X1. In the explanation of each formula, an expression “at least one” in the context of “at least one of “A” may be replaced by “B”” means that a position of “A” is arbitrary when the number of “A” is one, and also that a position thereof may be selected without limitation also when the number of “A” is two or more. For example, an expression “at least one of A may be replaced by B, C or D” includes a case where arbitrary A is replaced by B, a case where arbitrary A is replaced by C, and a case where arbitrary A is replaced by D, and also a case where a plurality of A are replaced by at least two of B, C and D. Specifically, “alkyl in which at least one of —CH2— may be replaced by —O—, and at least one of —(CH2)2— may be replaced by —CH═CH—” includes alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxyalkenyl and alkenyloxyalkyl. In the invention, in consideration of stability of a compound, a case where two successive —CH2— are replaced by —O— to form —O—O— or the like is not preferred. Moreover, a case where —CH2— in a methyl part (—CH2—H) on a terminal in alkyl is replaced by —O— to form —O—H is not preferred, either. 1. Tricyclic Compound Having a Plurality of CF2O Bonding Groups 1-1.

The liquid crystal composition of the invention may contain only one kind of compound (1), or two or more kinds of compound (1). The liquid crystal composition of the invention contains component A preferably in a ratio of approximately 1 to approximately 99% by mass, further preferably, in a ratio of approximately 5 to approximately 60% by mass, based on the total mass of the liquid crystal composition. Content of component A in the range is preferred in view of developing good characteristics of the liquid crystal composition (examples: threshold voltage, a temperature range of the liquid crystal phase, a value of dielectric anisotropy, a value of optical anisotropy, viscosity). The liquid crystal composition of the invention may contain only component A, or component A and any other component that is not particularly named herein. Moreover, in order to develop various kinds of characteristics, the liquid crystal composition may further contain at least one kind of component selected from component B, component C, component D and component E as explained below. When preparing the liquid crystal composition of the invention, a component can also be selected, for example, in consideration of dielectric anisotropy of compound (1).

Component B is a compound having halogen or a fluorine-containing group as a right-terminal group. Component B has a positive value of dielectric anisotropy and a superb stability to heat, light and so forth, and therefore is suitably used when preparing a liquid crystal composition for application to the TN mode or IPS mode to be driven by TFT. In formulas (2) to (4), a meaning of each symbol is as described below. R2 is independently alkyl having 1 to 10 carbons or alkenyl having 2 to 10 carbons, and in the alkyl and the alkenyl, at least one of hydrogen may be replaced by fluorine, and at least one of —CH2— may be replaced by —O—. X2 is fluorine, chlorine, —OCF3, —OCHF2, —CF3, —CHF2, —CH2F, —CF═CF2, —OCF2CHF2 or —OCF2CHFCF3. Ring B1, ring B2 and ring B3 are independently 1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,4-phenylene, 2-fluoro-1,4-phenylene, 2,6-difluoro-1,4-phenylene, tetrahydropyran-2,5-diyl, 1,3-dioxane-2,5-diyl or pyrimidine-2,5-diyl. Z1 and Z2 are independently a single bond, —(CH2)2—, —CH═CH—, —C≡C—, —COO—, —CF2O—, —OCF2—, —CH2O— or —(CH2)4. Herein, —COO— is bonded with each ring in a direction in which carbonyl (—CO—) is on a side of left-terminal group R2 and an ether bond (—O—) is on a side of right-terminal group X2. The rule means that, for example, when Z1 is —COO— in formula (2), —COO— is bonded in the form of R2-ring B1—COO-Ph(L5)(L6)-X2, and not R2-ring B1—OCO-Ph(L5) (L6)-X2. The rule also applies to —CH2O—. L5 and L6 are independently hydrogen or fluorine. In addition, in formula (3), a case where both Z1 and Z2 are —CF2O— is excluded. The rule means that component B does not contain a compound (compound represented by formula (B1) as described below) in which both Z1 and Z2 are —CF2O—. Moreover, in formula (3), when both Z1 and Z2 are —OCF2—, both L5 and L6 are hydrogen. The rule means that, when both Z1 and Z2 are —OCF2—, formula (3) is represented by formula (B2) as described below. In formula (B1) and formula (B2), R2, X2, B1, B2, L5 and L6 are defined in a manner identical with the definitions of identical symbols in formula (3).

Component C is a compound having a right terminal group in the form of —C≡N or —C≡C—C≡N. Component C has a very large positive value of dielectric anisotropy, and therefore is suitably used when preparing a liquid crystal composition for application to the TN mode, the STN mode or the IPS mode. When component C is introduced into the composition, the value of dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal composition can be increased, viscosity can be adjusted, the value of optical anisotropy can be adjusted, and a temperature range of the liquid crystal phase can be extended. Furthermore, component C is useful also for adjusting a voltage-transmittance curve of the device. In formula (5), a meaning of each symbol is as described below. R3 is alkyl having 1 to 10 carbons or alkenyl having 2 to 10 carbons, and in the alkyl and the alkenyl, at least one of hydrogen may be replaced by fluorine, and at least one of —CH2— may be replaced by —O—. X3 is —C≡N or —C≡C—C≡N. Ring C1, ring C2 and ring C3 are independently 1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,4-phenylene, tetrahydropyran-2,5-diyl, 1,3-dioxane-2,5-diyl or pyrimidine-2,5-diyl, and in the 1,4-phenylene, at least one of hydrogen may be replaced by fluorine. Z3 is a single bond, —(CH2)2—, —C≡C—, —COO—, —CF2O—, —OCF2— or —CH2O—. Herein, —COO— is bonded with each ring in a direction in which carbonyl (—CO—) is on a side of left-terminal group R3 and an ether bond (—O—) is on a side of right-terminal group X3. The rule means that, for example, when Z3 is —COO— and an equation: o=p=1 applies, —COO— is bonded in the form of ring C2—COO-ring C3, and not ring C2—OCO-ring C3. The rule also applies to —CH2O—. L7 and L8 are independently hydrogen or fluorine. Then, o is 0, 1 or 2 and p is 0 or 1. A sum of o and p is 0, 1, 2 or 3. Content of component C when using component C is ordinarily in the range of approximately 1 to approximately 99% by mass, preferably in the range of approximately 10 to approximately 97% by mass, further preferably, in the range of approximately 40 to approximately 95% by mass, based on the total mass of the liquid crystal composition. A liquid crystal composition having the content of component C in the range is preferred as a liquid crystal composition for application to the TN mode, the STN mode or the IPS mode. Moreover, when component E is further introduced into the composition together with component C, a temperature range of the liquid crystal phase, viscosity, dielectric anisotropy and optical anisotropy of the liquid crystal composition can be adjusted. Content of component E in the case is ordinarily in the range of approximately 1 to approximately 99% by mass, preferably, in the range of approximately 10 to approximately 97% by mass, further preferably, in the range of approximately 30 to approximately 95% by mass, based on the total mass of the liquid crystal composition. Component D (Compounds (6) to (11)) The liquid crystal composition of the invention may contain at least one kind of compound (component D) selected from the group of compounds represented by formulas (6) to (11). Component D is a compound having a benzene ring in which lateral positions are replaced by two halogens, such as 2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene. Component D is a compound having a negative value of dielectric anisotropy. Component D is suitably used when preparing a liquid crystal composition for application to the VA mode or the PSA mode. Moreover, when component D is mixed, an elastic constant can be controlled, and a voltage-transmittance curve of the device can be adjusted. In formulas (6) to (11), a meaning of each symbol is as described below. R4 and R5 are independently alkyl having 1 to 10 carbons or alkenyl having 2 to 10 carbons, and in the alkyl and the alkenyl, at least one of hydrogen may be replaced by fluorine, and at least one of —CH2— may be replaced by —O—. Ring D1, ring D2, ring D3 and ring D4 are independently 1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,4-cyclohexenylene, 1,4-phenylene, tetrahydropyran-2,5-diyl or decahydro-2,6-naphthalene, and in the 1,4-phenylene, at least one of hydrogen may be replaced by fluorine. Z4, Z5, Z6 and Z7 are independently a single bond, —(CH2)2—, —COO—, —CH2O—, —OCF2— or —OCF2(CH2)2—. Herein, —COO— is bonded with each ring in a direction in which carbonyl (—CO—) is on a side of left-terminal group R4 and an ether bond (—O—) is on a side of right-terminal group R5. The rule means that, for example, when Z4 is —COO— in formula (6), —COO— is bonded in the form of R4-ring D1-COO-Ph(L9)(L10)-R5, and not R4-ring D1-OCO-Ph(L9)(L10)-R5. The rule also applies to —CH2O—. Moreover, —OCF2— is bonded with each ring in a direction in which an ether bond (—O—) is on a side of left-terminal group R4 and difluoromethylene (—CF2—) is on a side of right-terminal group R5. The rule also applies to —OCF2(CH2)2—. L9 and L10 are independently fluorine or chlorine. Then, q, r, s, t, u and v are independently 0 or 1. A sum of r, s, t and u is 1 or 2. Compound (6) is a bicyclic compound, and therefore effective mainly in adjusting the viscosity, the value of dielectric anisotropy or the value of optical anisotropy. Compound (7) and compound (8) each are a tricyclic compound, and therefore effective in increasing the maximum temperature, increasing the absolute value of dielectric anisotropy, increasing the value of optical anisotropy, or the like. Compounds (9) to (11) are effective in increasing the absolute value of dielectric anisotropy, or the like. If the content of component D is increased, the absolute value of dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal composition increases, but the viscosity increases, and therefore the content is preferably decreased, as long as the requirement for the dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal composition is met. However, an absolute value of dielectric anisotropy of component D is approximately 5. Accordingly, in order to perform sufficient voltage driving, the content of component D is preferably in the range of approximately 40% by mass or more, further preferably, in the range of approximately 50% to approximately 95% by mass, based on the total mass of the liquid crystal composition. In the case, content of component A is preferably in the range of approximately 2 to approximately 40% by mass based on the total mass of the liquid crystal composition. A liquid crystal composition having the content of component D in the range is preferred as a liquid crystal composition for application to the VA mode or the PSA mode in the application. On the other hand, when component D is mixed with a liquid crystal composition having a positive value of dielectric anisotropy, the content thereof is preferably in the range of approximately 30% by mass or less, further preferably, in the range of approximately 10% or less, based on the total mass of the liquid crystal composition. Component E (Compounds (12) to (14)) The liquid crystal composition of the invention may contain at least one kind of compound (component E) selected from the group of compounds represented by formulas (12) to (14). Component E is a compound having alkyl or the like as two terminal groups. Component E has a small absolute value of dielectric anisotropy, and is close to neutrality. When component E is used, the threshold voltage, the temperature range of the liquid crystal phase, the value of dielectric anisotropy, the value of optical anisotropy, and the viscosity can be adjusted. In formulas (12) to (14), a meaning of each symbol is as described below. R6 and R7 are independently alkyl having 1 to 10 carbons or alkenyl having 2 to 10 carbons, and in the alkyl and the alkenyl, at least one of —CH2— may be replaced by —O—. Ring E1, ring E2 and ring E3 are independently 1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,4-phenylene, 2-fluoro-1,4-phenylene, 2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene, or pyrimidine-2,5-diyl. Z8 and Z9 are independently a single bond, —(CH2)2—, —CH═CH—, —C≡C—, or —COO—. Herein, —COO— is bonded with each ring in a direction in which carbonyl (—CO—) is on a side of left-terminal group R6 and an ether bond (—O—) is on a side of right-terminal group R7. The rule means that, for example, when Z8 is —COO— in formula (12), —COO— is bonded in the form of ring E1-COO-ring E2, and not ring E1-OCO-ring E2. Compound (12) is effective mainly in adjusting the viscosity or the value of optical anisotropy. Compound (13) and compound (14) are effective in extending the temperature range of the nematic phase by increasing the maximum temperature, or effective in adjusting the value of optical anisotropy. If the content of component E is increased, the viscosity of the liquid crystal composition decreases, but the value of dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal composition decreases, and therefore the content is preferably increased, as long as the requirement for the dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal composition is met. When preparing a liquid crystal composition for application to the VA mode or the PSA mode, the content of component E is preferably in the range of approximately 30% by mass or more, further preferably, in the range of approximately 40% by mass or more, based on the total mass of the liquid crystal composition.

It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the invention and specific examples provided herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention that come within the scope of any claims and their equivalents. The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended, nor should they be interpreted to, limit the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Hereafter, the invention will be explained in more detail by way of Examples, but the invention is in no way limited by the Examples. Unless otherwise noted, “%” is expressed in terms of “% by mass.” Compounds obtained in Examples and so forth were identified by a method such as an NMR analysis. NMR Analysis As a measuring apparatus, DRX-500 (made by Bruker BioSpin Corporation) was used. A sample was dissolved into a deuterated solvent such as CDCl3, and measurement of 1H NMR was carried out under the conditions of room temperature, 500 MHz and 24 times of accumulation. Tetramethylsilane was used as a reference material. Measurement of 19F NMR was carried out using CFCl3 as a reference material and under conditions of 16 times of accumulation. In the explanation of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, s, d, t, q, quin, sex, m, br and dd stand for a singlet, a doublet, a triplet, a quartet, a quintet, a sextet, a multiplet, broad, and a double doublet, respectively. Values of physical properties of a compound obtained in Examples and so forth were determined by methods as described below. Measurement Sample A liquid crystal compound per se was used as a sample, and (1) phase structure and (2) phase transition temperature were measured. A composition prepared by mixing a liquid crystal compound and a base liquid crystal was used as a sample, and values of physical properties of the composition, such as (3) compatibility at a low temperature, (4) and (5) maximum temperature and a minimum temperature of the nematic phase, (6) and (7) viscosity, (8) dielectric anisotropy, (9) optical anisotropy, (10) elastic constant, (11) threshold voltage and (12) voltage holding ratio, were determined. In a case where the composition prepared by mixing the liquid crystal compound and the base liquid crystal as the sample, measurement was carried out by a method described below. The sample was prepared by mixing 15% of liquid crystal compound and 85% of base liquid crystal. From measures values of the sample, extrapolated values were calculated according to an extrapolation method represented by an equation described below, and the extrapolated values were described as values of physical properties of the liquid crystal compound. [in-line-formulae](Extrapolated value)={100×(measured value of a sample)−(o of base liquid crystal)×(measured value of the base liquid crystal)}/(% of liquid crystal compound).[/in-line-formulae] However, when a smectic phase was maintained at 25° C. or a crystal precipitated at 25° C. even when a mixing ratio of the liquid crystal compound to the base liquid crystal was as described above, a mixing ratio of the liquid crystal compound to the base liquid crystal (liquid crystal compound:base liquid crystal) was changed in the order of (10%:90%), (5%:95%) and (1%:99%), and values of physical properties of a sample were determined at a mixing ratio at which no smectic phase was maintained at 25° C. or no crystal precipitated at 25° C. In addition, unless otherwise noted, the mixing ratio of the liquid crystal compound to the base liquid crystal (liquid crystal compound:base liquid crystal) is 15%:85%. As the base liquid crystal, base liquid crystal (i) containing components as described below was used. A ratio of each component in base liquid crystal (i) is expressed in terms of % by mass. Measuring Method Measurement of physical properties was carried out or can be carried out by a method as described later. Most of the measuring methods are applied as described in EIAJ ED-2521A of the Standard of Electronic Industries Association of Japan, or as modified thereon. No TFT was attached to a TN device used for measurement. (1) Phase Structure A sample (liquid crystal compound) was placed on a hot plate of a melting point apparatus (FP-52 Hot Stage made by Mettler-Toledo International Inc.) equipped with a polarizing microscope, and a state of phase and a change thereof were observed with the polarizing microscope while heating the sample at a rate of 3° C. per minute, and a kind of the phase was specified. (2) Phase Transition Temperature (° C.) A sample (liquid crystal compound) was heated and then cooled at a rate of 3° C. per minute using a differential scanning calorimeter, DSC-7 System or Diamond DSC System, made by PerkinElmer, Inc. A starting point of an endothermic peak or an exothermic peak caused by a phase change of the sample was determined by an extrapolation method, and thus a phase transition temperature was determined. The crystal was expressed as C, and when kinds of the crystals were distinguishable, each of the crystals was expressed as C1 or C2. The smectic phase was expressed as S and a nematic phase as N. When smectic A phase, smectic B phase, smectic C phase or smectic F phase was distinguishable among the smectic phases, the phases were expressed as SA, SB, SC or SF, respectively. An isotropic (isotropic liquid) was expressed as I. The phase transition temperature was expressed, for example, as “C 50.0 N 100.0 I.” The expression shows that a phase transition temperature (CN) from the crystal to the nematic phase is 50.0° C., and a phase transition temperature (clearing point) from the nematic phase to the isotropic phase (isotropic liquid) is 100.0° C. A same rule was applied to other expressions. All of units of the phase transition temperature are ° C. (3) Compatibility at a Low Temperature Samples were prepared by mixing base liquid crystal (i) and a liquid crystal compound for a mixing ratio of the liquid crystal compound to be 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 3% and 1%, and put in glass vials. The glass vials were kept in freezers at −10° C. or −20° C. for a fixed period of time, and then whether the crystal or the smectic phase precipitated was observed. (4) Maximum Temperature of a Nematic Phase (TNI or NI; ° C.) A sample was placed on a hot plate of a melting point apparatus (FP-52 Hot Stage made by Mettler-Toledo International Inc.) equipped with a polarizing microscope, and heated at a rate of 1° C. per minute. Temperature when part of the sample changed from the nematic phase to the isotropic phase (isotropic liquid) was measured. When the sample was a mixture of a liquid crystal compound and base liquid crystal (i), the temperature was expressed using a symbol TNI. When the sample was a mixture of a liquid crystal compound and component B or the like, the temperature was expressed using a symbol NI. TNI is an extrapolated value calculated by the extrapolation method described above, and NI is a measured value of the mixture per se. (5) Minimum Temperature of a Nematic Phase (Tc; ° C.) Samples each having a nematic phase were kept in freezers at 0° C., −10° C., −20° C., −30° C. and −40° C. for 10 days, and then liquid crystal phases were observed. For example, when a sample maintained the nematic phase at −20° C. and changed to a crystal or a smectic phase at −30° C., Tc was expressed as Tc≦−20° C. (6) Viscosity (Bulk Viscosity; η; Measured at 20° C.; mPa·s) Bulk viscosity (η) was measured using a cone-plate (E type) rotational viscometer. (7) Viscosity (Rotational Viscosity; γ1; Measured at 25° C.; mPa·s) Measurement of rotational viscosity (γ1) was carried out according to the method described in M. Imai et al., Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals, Vol. 259, p. 37 (1995). A sample was put in a TN device in which a twist angle was 0 degrees and a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 5 micrometers. Voltage was stepwise applied to the TN device in the range of 16 V to 19.5 V at an increment of 0.5 V. After a period of 0.2 second with no application, voltage was applied repeatedly under the conditions of only one of rectangular waves (rectangular pulse; 0.2 second) and no application (2 seconds). A peak current and a peak time of a transient current generated by the application were measured. A value of rotational viscosity (γ1) was obtained from the measured values and a calculation equation (8) described on page 40 of the paper presented by M. Imai et al. A value of dielectric anisotropy required for the calculation was determined by using the TN device used for measuring the rotational viscosity and according to a method described below. (8) Dielectric Anisotropy (Δ∈; Measured at 25° C.) A sample was put in a TN device in which a twist angle was 80 degrees and a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 9 micrometers. Sine waves (10 V, 1 kHz) were applied to the TN device, and after 2 seconds, a dielectric constant (∈∥) in the major axis direction of liquid crystal molecules was measured. Sine waves (0.5 V, 1 kHz) were applied to the TN device, and after 2 seconds, a dielectric constant (∈⊥) in the minor axis direction of the liquid crystal molecules was measured. A value of dielectric anisotropy was calculated from an equation: Δ∈=∈∥−∈⊥. (9) Optical Anisotropy (Δn; Measured at 25° C.) Measurement of optical anisotropy (Δn) was carried out by means of Abbe refractometer with a polarizing plate mounted on an ocular, using light at a wavelength of 589 nanometers. A surface of a main prism was rubbed in one direction, and then a sample was added dropwise onto the main prism. A refractive index (n∥) was measured when the direction of polarized light was parallel to the direction of rubbing. A refractive index (n⊥) was measured when the direction of polarized light was perpendicular to the direction of rubbing. A value of optical anisotropy was calculated from an equation: Δn=n∥−n⊥. (10) Elastic Constant (K; Measured at 25° C.; pN) HP4284A LCR Meter made by Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard Co. was used for measurement of elastic constant (K). A sample was put in a vertical alignment cell in which a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 20 micrometers. Voltage was applied to the cell in the range of 0 V to 20 V, and electrostatic capacity and applied voltage were measured. Measured values of the electrostatic capacity (C) and the applied voltage (V) were fitted to equation (2.98) and equation (2.101) on page 75 of “Liquid Crystal Device Handbook” (Ekisho Debaisu Handobukku in Japanese) (The Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun, Ltd.), and values of K11 and K33 were obtained from equation (2.99). Next, K22 was calculated using the previously determined values of K11 and K33 in equation (3.18) on page 171 of the same Handbook. An elastic constant is a mean value of the thus determined K11, K22 and K33. (11) Threshold Voltage (Vth; Measured at 25° C.; V) An LCD-5100 luminance meter made by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. was used for measurement of threshold voltage (Vth). A light source was a halogen lamp. A sample was put in a normally white mode TN device in which a twist angle was 80 degrees and a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was about 0.45/Δn (μm). Voltage (32 Hz, rectangular waves) to be applied to the TN device was stepwise increased from 0 V to 10 V at an increment of 0.02 V. On the occasion, the device was irradiated with light from a direction perpendicular to the device, and the amount of light transmitted through the device was measured. A voltage-transmittance curve was prepared, in which the maximum amount of light corresponds to 100% transmittance and the minimum amount of light corresponds to 0% transmittance. A threshold voltage is a voltage at 90% transmittance. (12) Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-2; Measured at 80° C.; %) A sample was put in a TN device having a polyimide alignment film in which a distance (cell gap) between two glass substrates was 5 micrometers. Then, the device was sealed with an ultraviolet-curable adhesive. A pulse voltage (60 microseconds at 5 V) was applied to the TN device and the TN device was charged. A decaying voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds with a high-speed voltmeter, and area A between a voltage curve and a horizontal axis in a unit cycle was determined. Area B is an area without decay. A voltage holding ratio is a percentage of area A to area B. Raw Materials Solmix A-11 is a mixture of ethanol (85.5%), methanol (13.4%) and isopropanol (1.1%), and obtained from Japan Alcohol Trading Co., Ltd. Tetrahydrofuran may be occasionally abbreviated as THF.
