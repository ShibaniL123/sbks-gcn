RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/974,963, filed Apr. 3, 2014, entitled “COMBINATION DISPENSER AND APPLICATOR,” assigned to the assignee hereof and the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND In the cosmetic industry, a wide assortment of cosmetic devices and products are available for various uses. For instance, compacts may be used to store dry cosmetic product, bottles may be used to store wet cosmetic product, brushes may be used to apply cosmetic product to a face, mirrors may be used to assist in applying a cosmetic product, dispensers may be used to expel cosmetic product from storage, and so on. A typical cosmetic user may have a collection of any combination of these devices. The collection may remain at the user's residence (e.g., in a bathroom cabinet) or the user may carry the collection or a sub-set of the collection with them when they leave their residence. For instance, many cosmetic users carry a collection of cosmetic devices and products in a carrying bag or purse. Because of the wide variety of cosmetic devices and products on the market, the user's carrying bag often becomes overcrowded and cluttered, making it difficult for the user to quickly find and use a desired cosmetic device. Accordingly, there remains a need for cosmetic devices that reduce cluttering by combining functions of multiple devices into a single device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Overview As discussed above, the wide assortment of available cosmetic devices may cause cluttering in a user's purse. Additionally, when each device is purchased individually, the costs of maintaining a collection of cosmetic devices can quickly escalate. This disclosure is directed to a cosmetic device that combines the functions of multiple cosmetic devices into a single device. For instance, the functionality of a mister or other dispenser may be combined with the functionality of an applicator. In some examples, a handle of the cosmetic device may comprise an internal reservoir for containing a cosmetic product. The internal reservoir may be communicatively coupled to a dispensing nozzle. Product may be conveyed from the reservoir and expelled from the dispensing nozzle by a dispensing mechanism, such as a pump. Alternatively, the contents of the reservoir may be under pressure and product may be conveyed from the reservoir and expelled from the nozzle by the pressure when a valve is opened. An applicator, such as brush, may be removably coupled to the handle. In some embodiments, the applicator may cover the dispenser nozzle when coupled. Multiple and varied example implementations and embodiments are described throughout. However, these examples are merely illustrative and other implementations and embodiments of a dispenser and applicator device may be implemented without departing from the scope of the disclosure. For instance, certain components, or portions thereof, may be rearranged, combined, used together, omitted entirely, and/or may be otherwise modified to arrive at variations on the disclosed implementations. Illustrative Combination Dispenser and Applicator FIG. 1 illustrates an example cosmetic device 100 comprising a handle 102, a ferrule 104, and an applicator 106 coupled to a first end of the ferrule 104. The cosmetic device 100 may be changeable between two or more positions including: a separated position 108, with the ferrule 104 separated from the handle 102, and an attached position 110 with the ferrule 104 removably coupled to the handle 102. In the attached position 110, a cavity 112 disposed on a second end of the ferrule 104, opposite the first end, may receive a dispensing head 114 extending from an end of the handle 102. The ferrule 104 and the applicator 106 may be made of a some or different materials, as discussed in greater detail below with regards to FIG. 5. In some examples, the handle 102 may have a circular, triangular, rectangular, regular polygonal, and/or irregular polygonal cross-section or combinations thereof. As shown in FIG. 1, the handle 102 may have a varying cross cross-section (e.g., a rectangular cross-section near the bottom that transitions into a circular cross-section near the dispenser head 114). Additionally or alternatively, the handle 102 may be tapered, curved, linear, round, and/or comprise gripping or ergonomic features. In some examples, a cross-section at an end near the dispensing head 114 may match a cross-section near the cavity 112 on the second end of the ferrule 104, so that the profile of the handle 102 smoothly transitions into the profile of the ferrule 104. The cosmetic device 100 may have an appearance of only a brush, or other applicator type, when in the attached position 110 because the dispensing head 114 and/or dispensing functionality may be concealed when the cosmetic device 100 is in the attached position 110. FIG. 2 illustrates an example handle 200 of the cosmetic device 100. The handle 200 may comprise an outer housing 202 with a reservoir 204 disposed within. The reservoir 204 may comprise a hollowed interior of the housing 202 and may contain a cosmetic product 206. The cosmetic product 206 may comprise a liquid, gel, foam, or any other at least partially viscous cosmetic material such as foundation, primer, lip balm, blush, concealer, highlighter, setting spray, fragrance, or remover. In some examples, the reservoir 204 may contain a liquid or cream emulsion, pressed powder, loose powder, dispersions, brush cleaner, water, and/or an anhydrous cream or liquid. In some embodiments, the handle 200 may comprise the dispenser head 108. The dispenser head 108 may comprise a spray nozzle, an atomizer nozzle, an aeration nozzle, or a nozzle for dispensing a foam or a gel. In other examples, the dispenser head 108 may comprise a roller, a brush or any other means of dispensing the cosmetic product 206. In some examples, the dispenser head 108 may be communicatively coupled to the reservoir 204 via a conduit 208. The conduit 208 may connect a spray aperture 210 disposed on the dispenser head 108 to a dispensing mechanism 212. The dispensing mechanism 212 may comprise a pump (manual or electric), or any other mechanism for conveying the cosmetic product 206 from the reservoir 202 through the spray aperture 210. In some examples, providing a downward force 214 on the dispenser head 108 may actuate the dispensing mechanism 212. In other embodiments, the contents of the reservoir 204 may be under pressure (e.g., in the case of an aerosol compressed liquid or gas dispenser). In that case, the dispensing mechanism 212 may comprise a valve and an internal pressure 216 may convey the product 206 from the reservoir 204 and through the spray aperture 210 when the valve is opened, creating a mist, spray, stream, foam, or other dispersion 218 of cosmetic product 206. In some examples, the internal pressure 216 may be greater than one standard atmosphere (atm), the typical external environmental pressure. In some examples, the internal pressure 216 may be between 2 and 5 atms. The dispensing mechanism 212 may communicatively couple to a dip tube 220 extending from the dispensing mechanism 212 into the reservoir 204. An end of the dip tube 220 may be submerged below a surface 222 of the cosmetic product 206 to receive the cosmetic product 206. In some examples, the dip tube 220 may be an extension of the conduit 208. Although FIG. 2 illustrates the spray aperture 210, the conduit 208, and the dispensing mechanism 212 being located together near an end of the handle 200, many other configurations are possible, as discussed in greater detail below with regard to FIGS. 6A-D. FIG. 3 illustrates an example cosmetic device 300 comprising a handle 302 having an at least partially flexible wall 304. The flexible wall 304 may be in contact with the reservoir 204 of the handle 302. When an external force 306 is applied to the flexible wall 304, the force 306 may be distributed into the reservoir 204, creating a pressurized environment and forcing the cosmetic product 206 into the dip tube 220. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the flexible wall 304 may comprise only a portion (i.e., less than all) of an outer housing 308 of the handle 300. In other examples, the entire outer housing 308 may comprise the flexible wall 304. In some embodiments, squeezing or pressing against the handle 302 may cause dispensing of the cosmetic product 206. The flexible wall 304 may comprise any flexible material such as plastic, rubber, metal foils, cellulose composites, and/or other composite materials. In other examples, the flexible wall 304 may comprise a rigid material (e.g., metal, wood, plastic, ceramics, and/or combinations thereof) flexibly coupled to the rest of the outer housing 308 at its edges, such that the flexible wall 304 may be pushed inwardly relative to the rest of the outer housing 308 to dispense the cosmetic product 206 FIG. 4 illustrates an example cosmetic device 400 comprising a handle 402, an applicator 404 coupled to a ferrule 406, and a cap 408.

The second coupling mechanism 424 may comprise any of the aforementioned features and/or characteristics of the first coupling mechanism 414. The first and second coupling mechanisms 414 and 424 may be substantially similar or they may be substantially different. In some examples, one or both of the coupling mechanisms 414 and/or 424 may be omitted. In some examples, the handle 402, the ferrule 406, and/or the cap 408 may comprise a substantially rigid or semi-rigid material such as metal, ceramic, glass, stone, wood, fiber glass, plastic, cellulose, composites, and/or combinations thereof. The handle 402, the ferrule 406 and/or the cap 408 may comprise the same material, different materials, or combinations thereof. Portions of the handle 402, the ferrule 406 and/or the cap 408 may comprise a transparent or translucent material. The handle 402, the ferrule 406 and/or the cap 408 may be monochrome or comprise multiple colors. FIG. 5 illustrates multiple embodiments of an applicator 500 coupled to a ferrule 502. A first embodiment 504 shows the applicator 500 comprising a plurality of bristles 506. The plurality of bristles 506 may comprise a synthetic material, such as plastic, silicone, latex, metal, or composites thereof, or a natural material, such as hair, cellulose fibers, cotton, hemp, flax or composites thereof. The plurality of bristles 506 may be tightly coupled to the ferrule 502 at a base 508 of the plurality of bristles 506, and expand as they extend away from the base 508. A second embodiment 510 shows an applicator 500 comprising a flocking 512. The flocking 512 may comprise a plurality of small fiber particles deposited onto a surface. The surface may be rigid or supple. A third embodiment 514 shows an applicator 500 comprising a sponge 516. The sponge 516 may comprise any at least partially porous material capable of absorbing the cosmetic product 206 and releasing the cosmetic product 206 upon compression. A fourth embodiment 518 shows an applicator 500 comprising a pen or marker 520. The pen or marker 520 may be substantially rigid and may receive a marking material (e.g., ink, pigment, etc.) from a reservoir in the ferrule 500 communicatively coupled with a tip 522 of the pen or marker 520. In other examples, the pen or marker 520 may receive the marking material externally by dipping the tip 522 in the marking material. In some embodiments, the applicator 500 may comprise a rigid or semi-rigid spatula (not shown). The spatula may be used to scoop and/or spread the cosmetic product 206. In some examples, the applicator 500 may have a polyhedral shape, as illustrated in FIG. 5. In other examples the applicator 500 may be substantially rounded, squared, flat, slanted, beveled pointed, curved, tear-drop shaped, or any other shape suitable for applying the cosmetic product. The applicator 500 may extend in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal dimension. In other examples, the applicator 500 may extend perpendicular to the longitudinal dimension. In some embodiments, multiple applicators 500 may be interchangeable with a single handle 400. The applicator 500 may comprise a material that corresponds to a particular type of cosmetic product to be used with the applicator 500. In some embodiments, the ferrule 502 may comprise a substantially rigid material such as metal, ceramic, glass, stone, wood, plastic, composites, and/or combinations thereof. To effectively couple to the applicator 500, the ferrule 502 may include crimps, screws, rivets, fusing, gluing, magnets, snap-fits, press-fits, stapling, notches, or any other coupling structures and/or methods suitable to hold the applicator. The method of coupling the ferrule 502 to the applicator 500 may be configured such that the applicator 500 can be removed and replaced by another applicator (not shown) of a similar or different configuration. In another embodiment, the method of coupling the ferrule 502 to the applicator 500 may be substantially immutable. As in the embodiments described above, the ferrule 502 may be a distinct unit from the applicator 500. However, in other embodiments the ferrule 502 may be an extension of the applicator 500 so that the ferrule 502 and the applicator 500 comprise a single applicator unit. FIGS. 6A-D illustrates multiple embodiments of a handle 600. Each embodiment shows a different configuration of a dispensing aperture 602 and an actuator 604 with respect to the handle 600. FIG. 6A illustrates a first embodiment 606 of the handle 600 with the dispensing aperture 602 disposed on a top portion 608 extending from a mating end 610 (i.e., the end that mates with the ferrule 104) of the handle 600. In some examples, the actuator 604 may be disposed on a side of the handle 600. The actuator 604 may be communicatively coupled to the dispensing mechanism 212 inside the handle 600 via a plurality of linkages and/or interconnected components (not shown). Accordingly, actuating the actuator 604 may cause the cosmetic product 206 to be dispensed from the dispensing aperture 602 FIG. 6B illustrates a second embodiment 612 of the handle 600 with the dispensing aperture 602 disposed on a side of the handle 600. In this embodiment, the actuator 604 may comprise the top portion 608, which may be compressed to disperse the cosmetic product 206 out the dispensing aperture 602. FIG. 6C illustrates a third embodiment 614 of the handle 600 with the dispensing aperture 602 disposed on the side of the handle 600 and the actuator 604 disposed on a bottom 616 of the handle 600. As discussed above, the actuator 604 may be communicatively coupled to the dispensing mechanism 212 via a plurality of linkages and/or interconnected components such that compressing the actuator 604 may cause the dispensing mechanism 212 to release the cosmetic product 206 through the dispensing aperture 602. In some examples, the actuator 604 may be positioned remote from the dispensing aperture 602. FIG. 6D illustrates a fourth embodiment 618 of the handle with the dispensing aperture 602 disposed in the actuator 604, positioned on the bottom 616 of the handle 600. In some examples, a cap 620 may be positionable over the dispensing aperture 602 and/or the actuator 604. The cap 620 may be held in place using any of the aforementioned coupling mechanisms 414. The dispensing aperture 602 and/or the actuator 604 may be disposed on an end of the handle 600 opposite the mating end 610 that couples to an applicator 622.
