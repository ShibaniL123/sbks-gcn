CA 02805059 2012-12-17 PORTABLE STERILIZING EQUIPMENT TO LOAD TRANSPORTABLE ASEPTIC CONTAINERS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention consists in a portable sterilizing equipment to be used in loading containers for transporting products aseptically. DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART Under the current state of the art drums of 80 to 205 liters are used with a sterilized bag for the transportation of products that must be carried aseptically, which involves handling, transporting and storing a great number of these drums. Filling of these drums must be performed inside the producer's facilities to be later transferred and loaded into a means of transportation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention describes a portable, self-contained and useful machine to sterilize the necessary lines and valves for the transportation of products aseptically in containers or tanks also sterilized. It basically consists in the machine itself accompanied by a boiler or vapor generator also portable and that forms integral part of said portable machine. This machine also has prior washing systems, using chemicals and other means necessary for the washing and sanitation of ail its parts. The portable machine would perform the function of washing, sanitizing and sterilizing the area between the machine and the container and/or ail pipes feeding and feeding-back said machine between the pasteurization facilities and the valves of the container. For washing purposes, chemicals are used, as well as recirculation water and the hot water resulting from the liquid phase inside CA 02805059 2012-12-17 the portable boiler; for sterilization the vapor phase inside this portable boiler would be used and/or other sterilization means. These other means could be ultraviolet light, radiation or any other available method. In addition, and if necessary, the machine could also sterilize part of the producer's filling and returning pipes. The machine shall allow making the type and size of containers flexible that may be loaded aseptically; this would result in significant savings in freight, loading and unloading times for the product from the pasteurization system to the transportation means, and also savings in relation to the costs of container materials and handling necessary for the filling and transportation of them to their final destination, thus improving competitiveness of domestic products as compared with other markets that do not have this innovating alternative. The machine would be placed between the pasteurization system's outlet from a facility located inside the producer's premises and the returning lines of said pasteurization system, temporarily replacing the fixed-format filling system existing at said facility. This machine is inserted between the pasteurization system and the existing filling system for a fixed size of container. The connection of said portable machine would be done through flexible hoses, which in turn make the size and position of the containers to be loaded :20 aseptically flexible. The containers or tanks for the transportation of products are mainly flexible tanks, rigid or semi-rigid tanks and any other transportation element with a capacity between 1,000 and 30,000 liters. Containers or tanks would be previously sterilized inside by using Gamma rays, ultraviolet light or another proper means for the kind of container to be filled. CA 02805059 2012-12-17 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES Figure 1 shows an installation scheme. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION At the producer's facilities located inside the plant or warehouse, storage tanks for the product (1) are considered equipped with a pump (2) to pump the content from said tanks (1) to the pasteurizer (3) and a by-pas valve (15) is installed allowing the processed product from the pasteurizer to continue its way to the customer's packaging system (6) or said product may continue its way to the filling coupling (8), from which the product may be taken to the tank or transportation container (14). Also a returning line (4) of the product is considered for using the customer's packaging system (6) and also a returning line (16) for the installation of an external tank (14). According to the position of the by-pass valve (5), the returning content may return to the pump (2) from the customer's packaging system (6) or from the external tank (14). For the use of the portable machine for sterilization, inserting the machine (9) and its boiler (10) at the producer's facilities is considered by connecting flexible hoses (17) and (18). For the sterilization of the tank valve or transportation container, the flexible hose (13) is used. The machine may provide washing and sterilization from the filling couplings (8) and returning :20 couplings (7) to the producer's filling and returning lines if necessary. The fluids for washing are within tanks (20) for such purposes and they are pumped through the washing machine (9) by the pump (19) to the filling couplings (8) and returning couplings (7). Consequently, the returning lines (16) are washed and when valve (5) is closed to the filling machine (6), the fluid returns to the tanks (20) though the line (21). Also the section between the coupling (8) and CA 02805059 2012-12-17 the valve (15) is washed when said valve is closed to the filling machine (6), with the fluid returning to the tanks (20) through the line (22). Also the tank's inlet valve may be washed through the flexible pipe for the washing of tank (13). For washing and/or sterilization with the boiler, vapor is injected into the washing machine through the boiler's vapor outlet line (11) and the boiler's liquid phase line (12). The fluid and the vapor go through the washing machine and they are injected into the filling (8) and returning (7) couplings. Also, the tank's inlet valve may be washed through the tank's washing flexible hose (13). For washing and/or sterilization with vapor through the boiler, the washing pump ! 0 is turned off. For filling the sterilized container or tank (14), the product is by-passed through valve (15), the filling coupling (8), the flexible hose (18), through the washing machine (9) and finally through the flexible hose (13) entering through the tank's or container's valve (23) to said tank or container (14). Then said tank or container (14) is removed and sealed. If necessary, the product may be returned to the returning line through the washing machine (9), the flexible hose (17) and the coupling (7). If other tanks or containers (14) should continue to be filled, only the area between the machine and the new tank installed should be washed and sterilized, including the tank's valve (23).
