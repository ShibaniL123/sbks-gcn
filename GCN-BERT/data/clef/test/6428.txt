FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the tobacco substitutes, in particular, to smoking compositions without tobacco and is intended, mainly, for smoking with hookah use. Smoking as inhalation of a smoke of preparations, mainly, of vegetative origin, smoldering in a flow of inhaled air, arose long ago. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that smoking is carried out with the purpose of saturation of the organism with active agents containing in the smoking composition by their sublimation and the subsequent absorption in lungs and breathing ways. Usually the smoking mixes are applied for smoking. These mixes are prepared by a certain method and they contain as the main smoke-generating material - tobacco, as various fillers in a type of various flavoring and aromatic additives from which the smoking products, mainly cigarettes, are prepared. But smoking of the cigarettes containing tobacco is very unhealthy for the person as it causes oncological diseases. Containing in the smoke structure nicotine causes and maintains the tobacco dependence. Dependence is accompanied also by a habit to inhalation of aromatic substances containing in a tobacco smoke such as: gum-resin, eugenol, pyrazine, liquorice, sugar, honey, menthol and others. Smoking of cigarettes is a process of pyrolysis: decomposition, disintegration or transformation of connections or substances in a result of heating to high temperatures 850 - 900°C. Smoking the hookah has got wide extending last time. In this process the smoke is passed through water and is partially cleared of harmful components. Process of smoking the hookah mix occurs at relatively low temperatures of 180 - 200 ° C, is characterized by the evaporation and distillation of volatile elements of the carbon - containing substances, in the process of which there is a sublimation of low - boiling compounds under the influence of heat from smoldering coal, therefore a hookah mix doesn't burn down but is dried up, thus the mass weight decrease reaches 30%. Glycerin (propyleneglycol) or the substance similar to it, that is a part of hookah smoking composition, forms the thick steam in the process of heating, that is similar to a tobacco smoke. At the absence of burning there are no pyrolysis products, and hookah mix isn't a combustible substance because of high dampness. Smoking the hookah has gained popularity because smoke in a hookah is passed through water and partially cleared of harmful components. The role of the filter is played by a hookah mine, on the cold walls of which the various impurities are condensed, and a vessel with liquid, in which about 38% of substances, containing in a smoke, are settled. The smoking cup with the tube is put into a vessel, the end of the tube is directed under water. Another tube is directed from a vessel above a water level. The smoke inhalation is made through this tube. Depression is created in a hookah vessel when smoking, thanks to what the smoke rises through liquid and gets to the lungs of the smoker through a tube. « », RU2403832 (C1), A24B13/00, A24B15/00, 20.11.2010 [1] is known; In the known method tobacco is used as a smoke-generating component that is very dangerous to the health of the person. Conventional method of preparation of smoking composition without tobacco ["", RU2256386 (C2), A24B15/16; 10.05.2010] [3] is intended generally for production of cigarettes. In the smoking material, obtained by this method [3], the content of an inorganic filler makes from 30 to 90 mas %, and the content of the fruits material makes from 10 to 30 mas % in recalculation to the dry substance. The disadvantage of the conventional method is that the dried powdery fruits lose the most part of flavoring and aromatic properties because of high dispersion and therefore the obtained smoking material is used mainly for cigarettes but not for the hookah. In a conventional method of preparation of smoking compositions without tobacco for a hookah [" ", RU2256387 (C2), (RU), A24D1/18, 27.11.2004] [4] the tea leaves are used as the main filling component, which are crushed to receipt of particles of 0,5-10 mm in size and dried up to dampness 12-20%. The smoking filling material, obtained by such a way, doesn't contain nicotine and doesn't make harmful effect at the smoker organism. The smoking filling material contains a small amount of alkaloids: caffeine (from 1 to 4 %), and also theobromine, theophylline, adenine, guanine, thus it allows to obtain toning effect. The disadvantage of a conventional method is that the obtained filling material quickly burns down, has a high consumption and a low quality of a smoke, doesn't allow to replace tobacco smoking and to overcome a habit to tobacco smoking, and also limits the range of flavoring and aromatic properties. The closest by destination and reached technical result is the method of preparation the smoking composition without tobacco for the hookah comprising a preliminary preparation of the main organic filling material and its soaking with binding [" " RU2388387, A24B15/16, 10.05.2010] [5]. The smoking mix without tobacco obtained by such a way comprises the tea raw material as the main organic filling material and glycerin as binding. According to a conventional method the tea raw material is washed out with hot water (80-90 °C) during 8 hours, dried and cut. Washing by hot water allows to remove theobromine, theophyllin, anthocyan glycosides and tannin - catechin mixes from the tea raw. These mixes can suppress the organoleptic properties of fragrance and are capable to cause the allergic reactions. The disadvantage of a conventional method is that the obtained smoking composition quickly burns down, has a high consumption at one filling of a hookah cup and not high quality of a smoke. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is the creation of such method of preparation of the smoking composition without tobacco for the hookah which would allow to reduce the burning rate and the consumption of smoking composition at one filling, and also would allow to improve the quality of smoke. The object is solved by that in a method of preparation the smoking composition without tobacco for the hookah, comprising preliminary preparation of the main organic filling material and its soaking with binding, according to the invention, at least one type of fruits is used as the main organic filling material and the mix of propyleneglycol and food glycerin in a proportion (1:4)-(4:1) is used as the binding, and preliminary preparation of the main organic filling material is performed by a liofilization, in the process of which the fruits are crushed to fraction 3-12 mm, refrigerated in liquid nitrogen at the temperature (-) 40 - (-) 60 °C, exposed under vacuum during 30-40 minutes until receipt of a filling material, with residual dampness of 1-6%, and its soaking with binding is carried out with the following ratio of components in composition, mas. %: the main organic filling material - 10-55;the binding - the rest. The using at least one type of fruits as the main organic filling material, and the mix of propyleneglycol and food glycerin in a proportion (1:4)-(4:1) as the binding allows to regulate steam amount and the smack of a smoke. The preliminary preparation of the main organic filling material is performed by a liofilization, in the process of which the fruits are crushed to fraction 3-12 mm, refrigerated in liquid nitrogen at the temperature (-) 40 - (-) 60 °C, exposed under vacuum during 30-40 minutes until receipt of a filling material, with residual dampness of 1-6%, that provides preservation of natural properties, structural integrity and biological activity in the dried-up fruits. The soaking of the filling material with binding in a ratio of components mas. %: the main organic filling material - 10-55, binding - the rest, provides the most effective recovery of natural properties of fruits in the process of soaking. The freezing of the crushed fruits in liquid nitrogen at a temperature (-) 40 - (-) 60 °C and exposure under vacuum during 30-40 minutes until receipt of a filling material with residual dampness of 1-6%, provide the sublimation of fruits without loss of structural integrity and biological activity, and also promotes the preserving flavoring and aromatic properties. If residual dampness of a filling material is higher than 6%, efficiency of its moistening with binding reduces that leads to reducing the quality of smoking composition. In case the increasing the quantity of the filling material in smoking composition more than 55% , the consumption of smoking composition at one filling of the hookah cup increases and also there is a danger of ignition of the filling material. In case of reduction of quantity of the filling material less than 10%, received smoking composition becomes liquid that creates the possibility of its leaking through openings in a hookah bowl that, in turn reduces the service life of one filling and pollutes a hookah mine. Thus, the applied method of preparation of the smoking composition without tobacco for the hookah allows to reduce burning rate and to reduce the consumption of smoking composition at one filling and improves its quality. Besides, using as the main organic filling material one of the following fruits: apple, pear, plum, peach, quince, apricot, grapes, lemon, water-melon, lychee, mango, banana, kiwi, orange, cherry, strawberry, melon, pineapple, raspberry, and also their mixes, expands the range of smoking compositions that allows to satisfy any wishes of the consumer. The soaking under the pressure up to 1 MPa, or under vacuum to (-) 1 MPa improves the quality of the soaking of fruits, especially of those that absorb liquid badly that reduces the price of a production process as doesn't require the use of the additional equipment for purification of air and supply of liquid in the soaking camera. If vacuum is created in the mixing container, air leaves itself and liquid is automatically soaked up. The using of extract of vanilla and/or food fragrances as flavoring additives in amount of 2-5% to composition provides expansion of the range of flavoring and aromatic combinations.

The soaking is performed in the mixing container with an atmospheric pressure, or under a high pressure to 1 MPa, or under vacuum to (-) 1 MPa, thus the time the mix spends under the pressure varies depending on the type of fruits; The extract of vanilla and/or food fragrances in amount of 2-5% are used as the flavoring additives to the composition. These additives are added in the binding in the process of the soaking. Further the invention is explained by accomplishment examples. Example 1. The lemon is used as the main organic filling material. The mix of propyleneglycol and food glycerin in a proportion (1:4) with addition of 3% of natural fragrance with taste of a lemon is used as the binding. In the process of preliminary preparation of a filling material a lemon is washed with water and crushed to the fraction 3-6 mm, quickly refrigerated in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -45 °C, then exposed under vacuum during 40 minutes until receipt of a filling material with residual dampness of 6%, The dried-up pieces of a lemon are put in a hermetic package of a polymeric material on the basis of a foil which excludes the oxygen access inside. The soaking with the binding is carried out in the mixing container before packing in the retail container, with the following ratio of components in composition, mas. %: the main organic filling material - 20;the binding - the rest The smoking composition received by such a way is characterized by steam with the lowered concentration, softness, is easily inhaled, has pleasant taste of a lemon with soft tart and sweetish smack. In comparison with a prototype, the consumption of smoking composition for the hookah cup decreased. Example 2. The grape is used as the main organic filling material. In the process of preliminary preparation of the filling material the grape is crushed to fraction 3-6 mm, quickly refrigerated in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -50 °C, then exposed under vacuum 30 minutes until the receipt of the filling material with residual dampness of 4%. The soaking of the filling material with the binding is carried out in the mixing container under vacuum to - 0,75MΠa during 10 sec. with the following ratio of components in composition, mas. %: the main organic filling material - 10;the binding - mix of propylene glycol and food glycerin - the rest. Received by such a way the smoking composition is characterized by light and soft steam, has the taste of grape with tart sweetish smack. In comparison with a prototype the decrease of the consumption of the received smoking composition when its using is noted. Example 3. The apples are used as the main organic filling material. The mix of propyleneglycol and food glycerin in a proportion 1:1 is used as the binding. The apples are washed out and crushed to fraction 3-5 mm, quickly refrigerated in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -60 °C, then exposed under vacuum during 40 minutes until receipt of a filling material with residual dampness of 3%. The soaking with the binding is carried out in the mixing container, with the following ratio of components mas. %: the main organic filling material - 10;the binding - mix of propyleneglycol and food glycerin in a proportion 4:1 - the rest. The smoking composition received by such a way is characterized by soft steam, has pleasant taste and aroma of apples. In comparison with a prototype, the decrease of the consumption of the received smoking composition when its using is noted. Example 4. As the main organic filling material the pears are used, and the mix of propylene glycol and food glycerin in a proportion 1:4 is used as the binding. The pears are crushed to fraction 3-12 mm, refrigerated in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -45 °C, then exposed under vacuum during 30 minutes until receipt of a filling material with residual dampness of 4%. The received filling material is put in a hermetic package. The coconut oil and food fragrances of the TAIGA International NV company, in amount of 2-5% of the total amount of liquid mix are used for the soaking with the binding with flavoring additives. The soaking is performed in the mixing container with the following ratio of components in composition, mas. %: the main organic filling material - 10;the binding - the rest. When smoking the received smoking composition, steam is characterized by softness and convenience of inhalation, has pleasant taste and aroma of a pear with weak tart, moderately sweetish smack and a light smell. Thus, the using of the applied method of preparation the smoking composition allows to reduce the burning rate and the consumption for one filling, to improve quality of a smoke and to expand the range of flavoring and aromatic properties. In the process of using of the described methods of preparation of smoking compositions a smoke with a pleasant combination of fresh taste of natural products with a weak tart and sweetish smack is produced. The smoke is transparent. The temperature of the hookah mix at the time of consumption is 180 ± 10 ° C. The researches showed that the nicotine content in a smoke is absent, and the content of monoxide of carbon doesn't exceed the average values received in the process of smoking of hookah mixes on the basis of tobacco. The lack of nicotine in a smoke in all examples of 1-4 allows to increase the safety of consumption of a hookah without deterioration of consumer properties. Thanks to the offered method of processing fruits keep the natural colour that allows to refuse of food dyes and maximum reduce the quantity of synthetic components in a product. Besides, the pieces of the filling material of fruits have the convenient size allowing to put them in the hookah cup with hands. The size of pieces of fruits less than 3MM leads to the mix infiltration through openings of the hookah cup because of what the service life of one filling reduces and the consumption of the smoking composition increases. The size of pieces of fruits more than 12MM leads to that they are not regularly located in the hookah cup and it creates problems with compactness of the packaging.
