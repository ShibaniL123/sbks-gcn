[Step 2] Synthesis of N-(3-fluorophenyl)-N-((5-(hydrazinecarbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)isonicotinamide
Methyl 6-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamido)methyl)nicotinate (0.277 g, 0.758 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and hydrazine monohydrate (0.737 mL, 15.163 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (10 mL), and the mixture was heated by microwave irradiation at 120Â°C for 1 hour, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (0.220 g, 79.4%) as white foam solid.
