FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a composition for washing and sanitizing food production plants, in particular milking and milk processing plants. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The qualities of the milk and dairy products begin at the dairy farm and, in particular, in the milking room. The behaviour adopted in the milking room, the techniques, the cleaning and disinfecting methods, such as the milking routine, can change the characteristics of the milk. The signs of a lack of cleanliness are highlighted by residues called sediments. These sediments present in the milking plant components, in the milking facilities and in adjacent areas can be classified into organic and inorganic sediments. Mineral deposits such as iron, calcium or magnesium in water, milk or chemicals cleaning products are called inorganic sediments. In time, an accumulation forms on the surfaces of milking plant components and the sediment becomes clearly visible. The term used to identify said sediments is "milk-stone". Said sediment promotes the growth of bacteria and provide them with protection against the cleaning and disinfecting chemical agents. Quality milk, both for direct consumption and for processing into cheese, must be produced from healthy animals, without udder infections and in a good state of health with low cell and bacterial counts. The quality of the milk cannot be improved post-milking, therefore milking operations, cleaning and disinfection of the premises, of the milking and milk storage equipment, if performed incorrectly, markedly degrade the characteristics of the milk, besides causing a greater incidence of cases of mastitis. Cleaning and disinfection of the milking plant are thus the most important operations for complete elimination of all traces of dirt or milk residue in the milking plant components. The milking plant is formed by different materials, such as glass, plastic, rubber, steel or aluminium. Said materials require different cleaning and disinfecting or sanitizing methods, thus the products to be used must be capable of adequately cleaning and disinfecting said materials, without corroding them. The object of the present invention is to find an effective product for washing and sanitizing the equipment that comes into contact with the food during the production, manufacture and distribution, and in particular, the equipment used in the dairy industry, that is at the same time easy to use and quick acting. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The above object has been achieved by a solid composition consisting of chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, sodium hydroxide, silica and a sequestering agent selected from alkaline tripolyphosphate, tetra-alkaline pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof, wherein said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is at least 20 wt% on the weight of the composition. With the term "chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt" is meant dichloroisocyanuric acid, trichloroisocyanuric acid, their sodium or potassium salts, anhydrous or hydrate, and mixtures thereof. In another aspect, the present invention concerns the use of a solid composition comprising chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, sodium hydroxide, silica and a sequestering agent selected from alkaline tripolyphosphate, tetra-alkaline pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof, wherein said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is at least 20 wt% on the weight of the composition, for washing and sanitizing the equipment used in the dairy industry. The characteristics and advantages of the present invention will be evident from the detailed description given below, and from the illustrative non-limiting working examples. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The subject of the invention is thus a solid composition consisting of chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, sodium hydroxide, silica and a sequestering agent selected from alkaline tripolyphosphate, tetra-alkaline pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof, wherein said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is at least 20 wt% on the weight of the composition. It has been surprisingly found that said solid composition is capable of cleansing equipment used in the dairy industry, such as the milking plant, in a deep and effective manner, preventing milk-stone deposition, thus reducing the use of acid detergent typically used after washing with alkaline detergents, removing all the microorganisms that can contaminate the milk, and providing solubilisation in water and immediate efficacy. In addition, the fact that it is in solid form advantageously allows reduction of the storage areas required, and reduction of the transport and disposal costs. Indeed, since the composition is particularly active at even very low concentrations and since the volume occupied compared to known products in liquid form is significantly reduced, the solid composition of the invention advantageously requires minimal spaces both during storage and during transport, with clear economic and ecological advantages. In addition, a further advantage of the use of a solid composition is the high stability of said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt compared to the stability of the chlorinated compounds in aqueous solution. This means that the storage times of said composition are extremely and significantly increased, not only with respect to the corresponding aqueous solutions, but also with respect to the known products. Furthermore, the composition of the invention does not require surfactants of any type and this is a further advantage, not only from an ecological point of view, but also from the point of view of food safety, since it is intended for equipment used in the processing of food, such as milk. Preferably, said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is selected from the group consisting of dichloroisocyanuric acid, trichloroisocyanuric acid, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, potassium dichloroisocyanurate, sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate, and mixtures thereof. In preferred embodiments, said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is sodium dichloroisocyanurate. It has been observed that said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, particularly sodium dichloroisocyanurate, allows the proliferation of microorganisms, such as bacteria, to be advantageously and effectively counteracted for periods of time much longer, especially with respect to other known chlorinated compounds. For the purposes of the present invention, the term 'solid composition' means a mixture in powder, granule, micro-granule, pellet, multiparticulate, micronized particulate form or a combination thereof. The composition of the invention is preferably in the form of micro-granules. Preferably, in said composition, said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is in an amount of 25-40 wt% on the weight of the composition; more preferably, it is in an amount of 27-35 wt% on the weight of the composition. A chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt in said amounts is more effective in removing that which may contaminate the milk and in synergising the detergent action of the sodium hydroxide. Preferably, in said composition, the sodium hydroxide is at least 40 wt% on the weight of the composition. Indeed, in this amount it has been observed that the sodium hydroxide has an improved detergent effect. More preferably, the sodium hydroxide is in an amount of 45-60 wt% on the weight of the composition. Preferably, the sequestering agent is in an amount of 10-30 wt% on the weight of the composition; more preferably, it is in an amount of 12-25 wt% on the weight of the composition. In fact, many minerals are present in the milk, including calcium, iron and phosphate, which deposit inside the milking plant forming the so-called "milk-stone'. The sequestering agent, present in high quantities in the composition, has the ability to form complexes with said ions bringing them in solution; there is therefore an advantageous reduction in the use of acid detergent. Suitable sequestering agent is one or more compounds selected from: inorganic polyphosphates such as sodium hexameta phosphate (SHMP), sodium polyphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium trimeta phosphate, sodium pyrophosphates, andphosphonated aminopolycarboxylates such as ethylenediaminetetramethyl phosphonic acid (EDTMP), Diethylenetriaminepentamethyl phosphonic Acid (DETMP), aminotrimethylphosphonic acid (ATMP), 1-hydroxy-ethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic Acid (HEDP), diethylenetriamine penta(methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMP). Inorganic phosphates work under specific conditions and work as sequestering agents by converting troublesome metal ions into water soluble complex by a process of ion exchange. Phosphates of aminopolycarboxylic acids or phosphonates are derivatives of phosphorous acid and are characterised by a C-P bond, which has stronger hydrolytic stability than the P-O-P bond of polyphosphates. This type of sequestering agents possess more features than mere chelation. These characteristics are: Threshold effect, i.e. inhibition of precipitation of CaCO3, CaSO4 with sub-stoichiometric quantities of inhibitor; Corrosion inhibition; Resistance to hydrolysis; Deflocculation i.e. stability effect on colloidal suspensions. Compared to popular amino polycarhoxylic acid based sequestering agents, these phosphonates based sequestering agents have a high chelation ratio. Apart from better chelation value or better chelation ratio, these phosphonates also have better iron chelation than EDTA and NTA. According to a preferred embodiment, the sequestering agent is sodium tripolyphosphate, as it offers a greater solubilisation rate in contact with water. Preferably, the composition of the invention consists of chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, sodium hydroxide, silica and a sequestering agent selected from alkaline tripolyphosphate, tetra-alkaline pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof, wherein said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is at least 20 wt%, the sodium hydroxide is at least 40 wt%, and the sequestering agent is in an amount of 10-30 wt% on the weight of the composition According to a preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention consists of 28-32 wt% of chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, 48-55 wt% of sodium hydroxide, 15-20 wt% of sequestering agent and 0.1-2 wt% of silica. According to an even more preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention consists of 29-31 wt% of chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, 49-51 wt% of sodium hydroxide, 19-20 wt% of sequestering agent and 0.3-1 wt% of silica. In another aspect, the invention concerns a unit dose of the above-described solid composition consisting of 28-32 g of chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt,48-55 g of sodium hydroxide.15-20 g of sequestering agent, and0.1-2 g of silica. Said unit dose is particularly advantageous in that it allows dosing errors and wastage to be prevented, ensures a solid product at constant composition, allows economy of warehouse space and transport costs, and prevents the problem of the storage and disposal of empty cans, which the liquid products of the prior art disadvantageously present. Said unit dose preferably consists of: 29-31 g of sodium dichloroisocyanurate,49-51 g of sodium hydroxide.19-20 g of sodium tripolyphosphate, and0.3-1 g of silica. According to a preferred embodiment, said unit dose comprises 100 g of the powder composition of the invention. The composition and the unit dose of the present invention are prepared by mixing the solid compounds in the weight ratios as defined above. In a further aspect, the invention relates to the use of a solid composition comprising chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, sodium hydroxide, silica and a sequestering agent selected from alkaline tripolyphosphate, tetra-alkaline pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof, wherein said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is at least 20 wt% on the basis of the weight of the composition, an industrial food field, since significantly satisfactory results have been achieved in the washing and sanitizing of the equipment used, particularly in the dairy industry. In the dairy industries, said equipment is specifically milking pails, drums, filters, milking machines, reservoirs, pipes, filling machines, glass items, cream separators, tanks, boilers, tubs, vats and cold storage tanks, milk processing lines, surfaces and floors. It has been observed that said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, particularly sodium dichloroisocyanurate, allows the proliferation of microorganisms, such as bacteria, to be advantageously and effectively counteracted for periods of time much longer, especially with respect to other known chlorinated compounds. This is particularly important in food industry, and especially in the diary industry, where the equipments are washed and sanitized every day, and notwithstanding this, microorganisms, such as bacteria, sometime resist and proliferate. Preferably, a solid composition consisting of chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, sodium hydroxide, silica and a sequestering agent selected from alkaline tripolyphosphate, tetra-alkaline pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof, wherein said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt is at least 20 wt% on the weight of the composition, is used for washing and sanitizing of the equipment in the dairy industry. In particular, the solid composition or unit dose are poured directly into said equipment in which water is present. Once the washing operations are concluded, the equipment is rinsed with water. The composition of the invention acts in an effective and safe manner, in that even in the event of incomplete rinsing, that is where traces thereof remain, no negative effect on the milk flora was observed. Furthermore, it has been surprisingly found that the suitable combination of components in the composition of the invention, including said chlorinated isocyanuric acid or its salt, allows the advantageous use of chlorine at low doses. It is in fact sufficient to pour the solid composition or unit dose into water in suitable quantities to reach a concentration of 0.5-2 g/I, preferably about 1 g/I. Indeed, a 100 g dose of composition is sufficient for 100 litres of water. The composition of the invention is therefore particularly practical since it does not require pre-dilution, but can be poured directly into the plant, being also particularly soluble. In a further aspect, the present invention concerns a product for washing and sanitizing of the equipment used, particularly in the dairy industry, comprising the composition above described. Said product can be in a solid, liquid, emulsion, suspension or gel form. It is to be understood that all aspects identified as preferred and advantageous for the composition of the invention, are to be deemed analogously preferred and advantageous also for the unit dose and the uses of said composition, as well as for the product comprising the same.
