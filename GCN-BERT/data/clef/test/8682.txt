64.2: 3-isopropyl-5-(2-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 64)
Similarly to example 51.4, starting from 495 mg (1.5 mmol) of [3-isopropyl-5-(2-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid and 384 mg (1.6 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (prepared as described in example 16.4), and after recrystallization from n-butanol, 285 mg (34%) of 3-isopropyl-5-(2-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 260Â° C.
