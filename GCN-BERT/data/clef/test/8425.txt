3-(2-Methoxy-2-methylpropyl)-5-methyl-6-[(3-methyl-2-oxoimidazolidin-1-yl)methyl]-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
To a solution of 45 mg (0.093 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 236 in 5 ml of THF were added, at 0Â° C., 4.5 mg (0.112 mmol) of sodium hydride (60% suspension in mineral oil), and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, 16 mg (0.112 mmol) of iodomethane were added, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 2 h. Then the reaction mixture was partitioned between saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (20 ml), THF (30 ml) and ethyl acetate (40 ml). The organic phase was washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 14). Combination of the product fractions and freeze-drying gave 32 mg (69% of theory) of the title compound
