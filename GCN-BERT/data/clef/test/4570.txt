BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to polybutadiene modified polymer polyols, foams comprising these polybutadiene modified polymer polyols, and to processes for the production thereof. Various types of filled polyols are known and described in the art. Filled polyols are typically stable dispersions of solid particles in a liquid base polyol. More specifically, the known filled polyols include, for example, polyisocyanate polyaddition (i.e. PIPA) polyols, polyurea and/or polyhydrazodicarbonamide (i.e. PHD) polyols and polymer (i.e. PMPO) polyols. The basic patents relating to such polymer polyol compositions are Stamberger, U.S. Patent. Re. 28,715 (reissue of U.S. Pat. No. 3,383,351) and U.S. Patent. Re. 29,118 (reissue of U.S. Pat. No. 3,304,273). As described therein, a stable dispersion of polymer particles in a polyol can be produced by polymerizing one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomer dissolved or dispersed in a polyol in the presence of a free radical catalyst. Since then, numerous patents have issued which describe various advances such as increasing solids contents, decreasing viscosity, enhancing stability, etc. in polymer polyols. These patents include, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,652,639, 3,823,201, 3,850,861, 3,931,092, 4,014,846, 4,093,573, 4,148,840, 4,172,825, 4,208,314, 4,242,249, 4,342,840, 4,390,645, 4,394,491, 4,454,255, 4,458,038, 4,460,715, 4,550,194, 4,652,589, 4,745,153, 4,997,857, 5,196,476, 5,814,699, 5,990,185, 6,455,603, 7,160,975, 7,179,882, 7,759,423 and Re 32,733 (reissue of U.S. Pat. No. 4,463,107). It is known that the filled polyols are suitable isocyanate-reactive components for the preparation of polyurethane materials such as foams, elastomers, etc. The two major types of polyurethane foams are termed slabstock foams and molded foams. Slabstock foams are used in the carpet, furniture and bedding industries. Primary uses of slabstock foam are as carpet underlay and furniture padding. In the molded foam area, high resiliency (HR) molded foam is the most common type foam made commercially. HR molded foams are used in the automotive industry for a breadth of applications ranging from molded seats to energy-absorbing padding and the like. As the demand for polymer polyols has increased, and the need for better and improved properties in the polymer polyols has increased, new advances in polymer polyol technology have been achieved. In spite of advances in reduction in viscosity and increased solids contents of polymer polyols, a need for further improvement in viscosity reduction and increase in solids content has continued to exist. In particular, there is a need for technology in polymer polyols that maximizes viscosity reduction while also providing a viable mechanism to higher solids content, while enhancing the stability of the polymer polyols. One way of enhancing stability of polymer polyols is by the presence of a minor amount of a graft or addition copolymer formed in situ from growing polymer chains and polyol molecules. Various approaches are known in the art. These typically incorporate small amounts of unsaturation into the polyol in addition to that inherently present in the polyoxyalkylene polyols typically used in forming polymer polyols. Various patents including U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,652,639, 3,823,201, and 3,850,861, British Patent 1,126,025 and Japanese Patent Nos. 52-005887 and 48-101494 utilize this approach. The use of “stabilizer precursors,” also termed a “macromer” that contains a particular level of reactive unsaturation, is based on the expectation that during polymerization, in the preparation of the polymer polyol, adequate amounts of stabilizer will be formed by the addition polymerization of the precursor stabilizer with a growing polymer chain. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,454,255, 4,458,038 and 4,460,715 describe the general concept of using stabilizer precursors in polymerization. A pre-formed stabilizer (PFS) is known to be particularly useful for preparing a polymer polyol having a lower viscosity at high solids content. In the pre-formed stabilizer processes, a macromer is reacted with monomers to form a co-polymer composed of macromer and monomers. These co-polymers comprising a macromer and monomers are commonly referred to as pre-formed stabilizers (PFS). Reaction conditions may be controlled such that a portion of the co-polymer precipitates from solution to form a solid. Pre-formed stabilizers may be dispersions having low solids contents (e.g., 3 to 15% by weight). It is preferred that the reaction conditions under which pre-formed stabilizers are prepared are controlled so that the particle size is small, thereby enabling the particles to function as “seeds” in the polymer polyol reaction. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,196,476, 5,990,185, 6,013,731, 7,160,975 and 7,776,969 as well as EP 0786480 describe a variety of pre-formed stabilizer composition. In general, these are prepared by polymerizing a macromer and one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the presence of a free-radical polymerization initiator and a liquid diluent in which the pre-formed stabilizer is essentially insoluble. The novel polybutadiene modified polymer polyols of the present invention offer distinct advantages that are not available from the present commercially available polymer polyols. These include improved flammability in foams prepared from these novel polymer polyols, and lower VOCs (volatile organic compounds) present in the foams compared to the present commercially available polymer polyols. It was surprisingly found that these advantages could be realized in polymer polyols by substituting either a polybutadiene for a portion of the liquid base polyol (typically a polyether polyol) in the composition of the polymer filled polyol, or by using a preformed stabilizer that comprises a polybutadiene. This has not previously been disclosed or suggested. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to polybutadiene modified polymer polyols.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings. The term pre-formed stabilizer is defined as an intermediate obtained by reacting a macromer containing reactive unsaturation (e.g. acrylate, methacrylate, maleate, etc.) with monomers (i.e. acrylonitrile, styrene, methyl methacrylate, etc.), optionally in a diluent or a solvent (i.e. methanol, isopropanol, toluene, ethylbenzene, polyether polyols, etc.) to give a co-polymer (dispersion having e.g. a low solids content (e.g. <25%), or soluble grafts, etc.). The term “monomer” means the simple unpolymerized form of chemical compound having relatively low molecular weight, e.g., acrylonitrile, styrene, methyl methacrylate, and the like. The phrase “free radically polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer” means a monomer containing ethylenic unsaturation (>C═C<, i.e. two double bonded carbon atoms) that is capable of undergoing free radically induced addition polymerization reactions. The term “stability” means the ability of a material to maintain a stable form such as the ability to stay in solution or in suspension. The phrase “polymer polyol” refers to such compositions which are produced by polymerizing one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers dissolved or dispersed in a polyol in the presence of a free radical catalyst to form a stable dispersion of polymer particles in the polyol. These polymer polyols have the valuable property of imparting to, for example, polyurethane foams and elastomers produced therefrom, higher load-bearing properties than are provided by the corresponding unmodified polyols. As used herein “viscosity” is in millipascals-seconds (mPa·s) measured at 25° C. on an Anton-Paar Stabinger viscometer. As used herein, the phrase polybutadiene modified polymer polyols refers to polymer polyols that contain from 0.03 to 1.0% (preferably 0.1 to 0.5%) by weight, based on 100% by weight of the polymer polyol, of polybutadiene.

Suitable chain transfer agents include, for example, mercaptans including benzylmercaptan as well as alkyl mercaptans such as, for example, dodecylmercaptan, butylmercaptan, octylmercaptan, laurylmercaptan, cyclohexylmercaptan, etc., alkyl-substituted tertiary amines include compounds such as, for example, triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, N,N-diethylethanolamine, N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylmorpholine, N,N-diethylpiperazine, etc., alcohols include, for example, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, tert-butanol, allyl-alcohol, etc., enol-ethers include, for example, (cyclohex-3-enylidenemethoxymethyl)-benzene, etc., halogenated hydrocarbons including, for example, carbon tetrachloride, carbon tetrabromide, chloroform, methylene chloride, etc. Other known chain transfer agents include compounds such as, for example, ethylbenzene and toluene. In accordance with the present invention, preferred chain transfer agents include isopropanol, ethanol, tert-butanol, toluene, ethylbenzene, triethylamine, dodecylmercaptan, octadecylmercaptan, etc. Chain transfer agents are employed in amounts of from 0.1% by weight, preferably of at least about 1%, more preferably at least about 2% and most preferably at least about 3% by weight. Chain transfer agents are also employed in amounts of less than or equal to 25% by weight, preferably less than or equal to about 20%, more preferably less than or equal to 15% and most preferably less than or equal to about 10% by weight. The weight basis for the chain transfer agent is the total weight of all the components charged to reactor. The chain transfer agent may be employed in any amount ranging between any combination of these lower and upper values, inclusive, e.g., from 0.1% to about 25% by weight, preferably from about 1% to about 20% by weight, more preferably from about 2% to about 15% by weight and most preferably from about 3% to about 10% by weight. The polymer polyols are preferably produced by utilizing a low monomer to polyol ratio which is maintained throughout the reaction mixture during the process. This is achieved by employing conditions that provide rapid conversion of monomer to polymer. In practice, a low monomer to polyol ratio is maintained, in the case of semi-batch and continuous operation, by control of the temperature and mixing conditions and, in the case of semibatch operation, also by slowly adding the monomers to the polyol. The temperature range is not critical and may vary from about 80° C. to about 150° or perhaps greater, the preferred range being from about 90° C. to about 140° C., more preferably from about 100° C. to about 135° C., and most preferably from about 110° C. to about 130° C. As has been noted herein, the catalyst and temperature should be selected so that the catalyst has a reasonable rate of decomposition with respect to the hold-up time in the reactor for a continuous flow reactor or the feed time for a semi-batch reactor. The mixing conditions employed are those obtained using a back mixed reactor (e.g.—a stirred flask or stirred autoclave). The reactors of this type keep the reaction mixture relatively homogeneous and so prevent localized high monomer to polyol ratios such as occur in tubular reactors when such reactors are operated with all the monomer added to the beginning of the reactor. The polymer polyols of the present invention comprise dispersions in which the polymer particles (the same being either individual particles or agglomerates of individual particles) are relatively small in size and, in the preferred embodiment, have a weight average size less than about ten microns. However, when high contents of styrene are used, the particles will tend to be larger; but the resulting polymer polyols are highly useful, particularly where the end use application requires as little scorch as possible. In accordance with the present invention, all of the product (viz. 100%) will pass through the filter employed in the 150 mesh filtration hindrance (filterability) test with low polymer residue (typically <5 ppm), and an exceptionally high amount of the product will pass through a 700 mesh screen within 600 seconds. It is preferred that at least 99% pass through a 700 mesh screen, and more preferred that at least 100% pass through a 700 mesh screen. In accordance with the present invention, 100% of the product should pass through the 700 mesh screen within 600 seconds. The 150 mesh filtration and 700 mesh filtration tests are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,196,476, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. In accordance with the present invention, foams may be prepared from the novel polybutadiene modified polymer polyols described herein. These foams comprise the reaction product of a polyisocyanate, with an isocyanate-reactive component comprising the novel polybutadiene modified polymer polyols described herein, optionally, in the presence of a blowing agent, a catalyst and a surfactant. In addition, crosslinking agents, chain extenders, surfactants, and other additives and auxiliary agents which are known to be useful in preparing foams may also be present. The process of preparing the foams comprises reacting a polyisocyanate component, with an isocyanate-reactive component comprising the novel polybutadiene modified polymer polyols described herein, in the presence of a blowing agent and at least one catalyst. In addition, crosslinking agents, chain extenders, surfactants, and other additives and auxiliary agents may also be present. Suitable polyisocyanates comprise those known in the art, particularly aromatic polyisocyanates such as, for example, toluene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate, etc. These are known in the field of polyurethane chemistry. The isocyanate-reactive component for preparing the polyurethane foams comprises the novel polybutadiene modified polymer polyols described herein. It is also possible that the isocyanate-reactive component comprises (1) the above described novel polybutadiene modified polymer polyols and (2) a conventional isocyanate-reactive component such as, for example, a polyoxyalkylene polyol, a polyether polyol, a polyester polyol, etc. Lower molecular weight isocyanate-reactive components such as crosslinkers and/or chain extenders may also be present. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, foams (preferably molded foams) may be prepared from an isocyanate-reactive component that comprises (1) from 5 to 100% (preferably from 10 to 75%, more preferably from 15 to 70%, most preferably from 20 to 65% and most particularly preferably from 25 to 50%) by weight of the polybutadiene modified polymer polyol described herein, and (2) from 0 to 95% (preferably from 25 to 90%, more preferably from 30 to 85%, most preferably from 35 to 80% and most particularly preferably from 50 to 75%) by weight of a conventional isocyanate-reactive component such as a polyether polyol, a polyester polyol, a polyoxyalkylene polyol, etc. The sum of the %'s by weight of components (1) and (2) totals 100% by weight of the isocyanate-reactive component used to prepare the foams herein. Suitable blowing agents for the present invention include, for example chemical blowing agents, i.e. isocyanate reactive agents that generate blowing gases, such as for example water and formic acid and physical blowing agents such as carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, highly fluorinated and/or perfluorinated hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane, etc., or acetals such as methylal. These physical blowing agents are usually added to the polyol component of the system. However, they can also be added in the isocyanate component or as a combination of both the polyol component and the isocyanate component. It is also possible to use them together with highly fluorinated and/or perfluorinated hydrocarbons, in the form of an emulsion of the polyol component. If emulsifiers are used, they are usually oligomeric acrylates which contain polyoxyalkylene and fluoroalkane radicals bonded as side groups and have a fluorine content of from about 5 to 30% by weight. Such products are sufficiently well known from plastics chemistry, e.g. EP-A-0351614. Water is the preferred blowing agent. The amount of blowing agent or blowing agent mixture used is from 0.5 to 20%, preferably from 0.75 to 10% by weight, based in each case on the total weight of the component (B). When water is the blowing agent, it is typically present in an amount of from 0.5 to 10%, and preferably from 0.75 to 7% by weight, based on the total weight of the component (B). The addition of water can be effected in combination with the use of the other blowing agents described. Surfactants are preferably used to prepare the foams. Surfactants are known help to stabilize the foam until it cures, Suitable surfactants for the invention are those well known in the polyurethane industry. A wide variety of organosilicone surfactants are commercially available. Examples of suitable surfactants include DC-5043, DC-5164 and DC-5169, as well as Niax L-620, a product of Momentive Performance Materials, and Tegostab B8244, a product of Evonik-Goldschmidt. Many other silicone surfactants known to those in the art may be substituted for these suitable silicones. The surfactant is typically used in an amount within the range of about 0.1 to 4, preferably from about 0.2 to 3, parts per 100 parts of isocyanate-reactive mixture. At least one polyurethane catalyst is required to catalyze the reactions of the monol, polyols and water with the polyisocyanate. It is common to use both an organoamine and an organotin compound for this purpose. Suitable polyurethane catalysts are well known in the art; an extensive list appears in U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,908, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Suitable organotin catalysts include tin salts and dialkyltin salts of carboxylic acids. Examples include stannous octoate, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin diacetate, stannous oleate, and the like. Suitable organoamine catalysts are tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, triethylenediamine, bis(2,2′-dimethylamino)ethyl ether, N-ethylmorpholine, diethylenetriamine, and the like. Preferred catalysts are amine catalysts such as, for example, bis(dimethylaminoethyl)ether in dipropylene glycol and triethylene diamine in dipropylene glycol. These are commercially available as Niax A-1 and Niax A-33, respectively. The polyurethane catalysts are typically used in an amount within the range of about 0.05 to about 3 parts, more preferably from about 0.1 to about 2 parts, per 100 parts of isocyanate-reactive mixture. Other optional components that may be present in the foam formulations include, for example, flame retardants, antioxidants, pigments, dyes, liquid and solid fillers, etc. Such commercial additives are included in the foams in conventional amounts when used. The foams are prepared using methods that are well known in the industry. These methods may include continuous or discontinuous free-rise slabstock foam processes and molded foam processes. In a typical slabstock process, the isocyanate is continuously mixed together with the other formulation chemicals by passing through a mixing head and then into a trough which overflows onto a moving conveyor. Alternatively, the reacting mixture is deposited directly onto the moving conveyor. In another embodiment, high pressure liquid carbon dioxide is fed into one or more of the formulation components, typically the polyol, entering into the mixing head and the resin blend is passed through a frothing device where the pressure is let down and the resultant froth is deposited onto the conveyor. The foam expands and rises as it moves down the conveyor to form a continuous foam slab that is cut into blocks or buns of the desired length for curing and storage. After curing for one or more days, these foam buns can be cut into the desired shapes for the end-use applications. In the discontinuous process, the reactants are quickly mixed together through a head or in a large mixing chamber. The reaction mixture is then deposited into a large box or other suitable container where foam expansion occurs to form a bun of the lateral dimensions of the container. A typical molded foam process usually employs a one-shot approach in which a specific amount of the isocyanate stream (the “A” side) is rapidly combined and mixed with a specific amount of the remaining formulation components (the “B” side). An additional stream may be employed to bring in one or more specific components not included with the “B” side stream. The mixture is quickly deposited into a mold that is then closed. The foam expands to fill the mold and produce a part with the shape and dimensions of the mold. Although less preferred, a prepolymer approach to making the foams can also be used. In this approach, a significant portion of the isocyanate-reactive mixture is reacted with the polyisocyanate, and the resulting prepolymer is then reacted with the remaining components. The following examples further illustrate details for the preparation and use of the compositions of this invention. The invention, which is set forth in the foregoing disclosure, is not to be limited either in spirit or scope by these examples. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions and processes of the following preparative procedures can be used to prepare these compositions.

After 4.5 minutes, the foam was removed from the mold, run through a cell-opening crushing device, and then placed in a 250° F. oven for 30 minutes to post cure. After 24 hours of aging in a controlled temperature and humidity laboratory, the foams were submitted for physical property testing. Physical properties for Foams 1-3 are reported in Table 5.
