VIRGIN COCONUT OIL TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to oil and methods of extracting the same. More specifically, methods of extraction that do not include the use of heat and additives (for example, chemicals and solvents other than water) are provided. BACKGROUND Oil, the relatively non-polar carbon-hydrogen short chain polymers, can be classified as organic or mineral depending on whether the organic matter from which it is derived is fossilized or non- fossilized. While mineral oil is generally obtained from sub-surface fossilized materials, organic oils are extracted from fresh plants, animals, and/or other non-fossilized organic matter. Oil must be extracted from the organic matter. The method of extraction used depends on a number of factors, such as, the organic matter being extracted, the intended use of the oil, and the like. Oils present in organic matter contain saturated fats and unsaturated fats, free fatty acids, monoglycerides, diglycerides, unsaponifiable lipids, fat soluble vitamins, and other nutrients. Different organic matter provides different amounts of these components. Saturated fats include, for example, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. Laurie acid, while increasing overall cholesterol in the human body, increases primarily high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol rather than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Lauric acid has other benefits as well, including an anti-microbial effect in situ. Sources of lauric acid are limited and include human milk, cow milk, goat milk, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil. Many known methods have been used to obtain oil from plants. A common method of oil extraction from plants is pressing, which typically comprises passing the plant or seed(s) thereof through a screw press to extract out the oil. For example, an oil rich kernel of palm fruit, dried coconut or copra may be passed through a screw press to extract out the oil. Currently, the extraction of cooking oil on a commercial level is typically done using liquid-liquid extraction with hexane. Hexane is a mild anesthetic, which in small doses is capable of causing headaches, nausea, and dizziness. Chronic exposure, however, can result in inducing peripheral nervous system failure, muscular weakness, blurred vision, headaches and fatigue. Hexane is also an environmental contaminant. When used in the extraction of vegetable oil, hexane is not completely removed from the oil after extraction; rather, some of the hexane used for the extraction is retained in the final product. Commercially used oils for use in cooking, cosmetics, and as essential oils require a pleasant scent and a high level of clarity. Thus, after extraction, the oil is typically treated by refining, bleaching, and deodorizing (RBD). The refining process involves chemically treating and bleaching the raw oil using acidified activated clay with heat. Deodorization requires heating of the oil to a high temperature under vacuum with activated carbon. The oil is then cooled. The additives (acids, bases, clay, bleach, etc.) high heat, and shear employed by the RBD process can lead to degradation of certain fats, fatty acids, and other beneficial nutrients present in the oil. Virgin oils are those oils produced without the use of chemicals to treat the oil. While current methods of producing virgin olive oil with high levels of clarity and a pleasant odor are well known, the current methods for producing virgin coconut oil are less effective at obtaining high levels of clarity and a pleasant odor. The current methods used for producing virgin coconut oil typically involve the use of heat to extract the oil. For example, one current method for producing virgin coconut oil typically involves grating, drying, and pressing or centrifuging coconut meat to extract the oil. With respect to the drying step, heat is often added to quickly dry the coconut meat. Also, both pressing and centrifuging generate heat that further enhances removal of the oil from the dried coconut meat. However, the heat added to quickly dry the coconut meat and the heat generated by pressing or centrifuging the dried coconut meat to extract the oil can degrade certain fats, fat compositions, fatty acids, and other beneficial nutrients present in the oil. Another currently used method for producing virgin coconut oil involves boiling coconut milk to extract the oil. Other currently used methods for producing virgin coconut oil utilize heat to reduce the moisture content in the coconut oil. Here also, the heat added during the boiling step and the heat added to reduce the moisture content may degrade fatty acids present in the oil. The currently used methods for extracting virgin coconut oil can result in virgin coconut oil having a somewhat malodorous scent and a semi-clouded appearance. In view of the above, there is a need to provide a method of extracting and producing virgin coconut oil with a high level of clarity and a pleasant odor, wherein the method preserves fats, fatty acids, enzymes and other beneficial nutrients present in the oil, and wherein the method prevents or does not lead to the degradation of the fats, fatty acids, enzymes, and other beneficial nutrients present in the oil.

This applies regardless of the breadth of the range. Particular aspects of the present disclosure relate to extraction of virgin oil from coconut in a manner that uses no heat or chemicals in the extraction process, wherein the virgin coconut oil product has a high level of clarity and a pleasant coconut odor. In some embodiments, the virgin coconut oil is extracted without the use of heat, for example, in the absence of non-trivial significant mechanical forces that generate heat. In some embodiments, the process uses water, time, gravity, and small batch size to achieve clear virgin coconut oil with a mild pleasant coconut odor. In some embodiments, the process uses a large industrial scale batch size to extract and produce clear virgin coconut oil with a mild pleasant coconut odor. In some embodiments, the produced clear virgin coconut oil is colorless. FIG. 1 depicts the parts of a coconut in accordance with the present disclosure. The coconut 10 can include: an outer coat of fruit or skin of husk 12; a fibrous coat, husk, or coir 14; an inner hard coat of fruit or hard shell 16; a seed coat or seed coat shell 18; liquid endosperm, or coconut water 20; and, a white flesh, kernel, or solid endosperm 22. In accordance with the present disclosure, the term "coconut meat" can refer to or be synonymous with white flesh, coconut kernel, and solid endosperm. The term "coconut water" can refer to the liquid endosperm 20 of FIG. 1. The term "coconut milk" can refer to an initial extract of the kernel, solid endosperm, or white flesh 22 of FIG. 1. The term "coconut" 10 can refer to or be synonymous with the seed of the Cocos nucifera. One embodiment of a process of the present disclosure is described with reference to FIG. 2. As depicted in FIG. 2, step 110 of the process 100 includes harvesting a coconut from a Cocos nucifera tree. The outer coat 12 and husk 14 are then removed resulting in coconut 112 with a hard shell 16, which can then be discarded or used for another purpose. In step 114, the hard shell 16 can then be cracked to release the coconut water 20, which can then be discarded or used for another purpose. The coconut is then halved 116 to expose the white flesh or kernel 22. Next, as shown in step 118, the kernel 22 can be removed from the hard shell 16 and also optionally removed from the seed coat shell 18. The kernel 22 free of the hard shell 16 is depicted in 120. As shown in step 122, the kernel 22 is ground or grated. Any type of grater can be used to grate the coconut, for example, mechanical graters, manual graters, and the like and combinations of these. The method of grating can be a method that does not generate heat and can be performed at about room temperature. The shredded kernel 124 is then extruded or expressed 126A producing coconut milk and spent coconut kernel 126B. The extruding or expressing step utilizes a trivial mechanical force to produce the coconut milk; thus, no heat is generated. The extruding apparatus or expressing apparatus can be modified or adjusted such that no heat is generated during the extruding or expressing step. As shown at 128 the coconut milk is collected and at step 130 the coconut milk is transferred to a separatory funnel. Each of the steps of the oil extraction process explained using FIG. 2 can be performed at a temperature of about 20°C to about 45°C, preferably about 20°C to about 40°, and more preferably about room temperature. Oil 132 is extracted from the coconut milk. In step 130, the coconut milk can be transferred to a separatory funnel / separating funnel and water can be added. In some embodiments, the separatory funnel can be from about 250 mL to about 10,000 Liters in size. In some embodiments, the separatory funnel can be about 140 Liters in size. In some embodiments, the separatory funnel can be from about 250 mL to about 2 Liters in size. In some embodiments, the separatory funnel is about 1 Liter in size. Other smaller and larger sizes of separatory funnels are also contemplated. In some embodiments, a separating vessel can be used when processing a large volume of coconut milk. In some embodiments, the separating vessel can be from about 250 mL to about 10,000 Liters in size. In some embodiments, the separating vessel can be about 140 Liters in size. Other smaller and larger sizes of separating vessels are also contemplated. The amount of water added to the separatory funnel depends on the size of the separatory funnel and the amount of coconut milk added to the separatory funnel. In some embodiments, the amount of water added to the separatory funnel can be about the same in volume as the amount of coconut milk added to the separatory funnel. In some embodiments, the amount of water added to the separatory funnel can be less than the volume of the coconut milk added to the separatory funnel. In some embodiments, the amount of water added to the separatory funnel can be greater than the volume of the coconut milk added to the separatory funnel. The amount of water added can be at least enough to cover the coconut milk added to the separatory funnel and less than the amount that would overflow the separatory funnel upon shaking of the separatory funnel. In some embodiments, the amount of water added to the coconut milk in the separatory funnel may be about 50 ml to about 500 ml. In some embodiments, the amount of water added to the coconut milk in the separatory funnel may be about 5 volume percent to 30 volume percent. In some embodiments, sufficient air space is present in the separatory funnel for shaking, agitation and mixing purposes. The water added to the separatory funnel can be, for example, tap water or purified water. Purified water can be, for example, distilled water, deionized water, microfiltered water, ultrafiltered water, ultraviolet oxidized water, electrodialysed water, water purified by reverse osmosis, and the like, and combinations of these. The temperature of the water can be from about 20°C to about 45°C, and preferably about room temperature. Following addition of the coconut milk and water to the separatory funnel, the separatory funnel can be shaken or agitated to "wash" the coconut milk with the water. Shaking or agitation can be performed using a mechanical shaker or by manual shaking. The shaking or agitation can occur for example, for about 0.2 minutes (12 seconds) to about 10 minutes. The shaking step or agitation step mixes the coconut milk medium and the water medium together. However, the coconut milk medium and water medium cannot form a stable homogenous mixture during the shaking step or agitation step. As such, the water acts as a washing agent for the coconut milk. After a first wash, the mixture of coconut milk and water is allowed to settle. Settling may occur, for example, over the course of about 0.5 hours (30 minutes) to about 2 hours after the first wash. As shown in FIG. 3, after the first wash, three layers form: a top layer of washed coconut milk 210, a middle layer of impure coconut milk 212, and a lower layer of wash water comprising fine coconut kernel particles and/or foreign particles 214. The foreign particles may comprise seed coat shell particles and/or other types of foreign particles. The washed coconut milk 210 can include sugars, fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and the like and combinations of these. The impure coconut milk 212 can include sugars, fiber, fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, proteins, enzymes and the like, and combinations of these. Following the first wash, the wash water portion comprising fine coconut kernel particles and/or foreign particles 214 is drained from the separatory funnel, new water is added and a new wash can be performed. Any number of washes of the coconut milk can be performed. In some embodiments, between about 1 wash and 10 washes are performed. In some embodiments, 3 washes are performed. After each wash and settling step, the wash water portion comprising fine coconut kernel particles and/or foreign particles 214 is drained from the separatory funnel. After the coconut milk is washed, the mixture can rest. The amount of resting time can vary, for example, the mixture can rest for from about 5 minutes to about 2 hours and/or until three distinct layers form with an unfermented coconut milk forming the top layer a cloudy coconut milk water layer forming the middle layer, and a layer comprising wash water and foreign particles forming the bottom layer. During this resting period and subsequent thereto, the separatory funnel containing the mixture should not be shaken and/or agitated. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, as the mixture 300 is resting, three distinct layers can form. The top layer may comprise unfermented coconut milk 310 that will subsequently undergo fermentation to form a crude oil layer above and/or under a curd layer. The middle layer may comprise cloudy coconut milk water 312. The bottom layer may comprise wash water and foreign particles 314. FIG. 5 illustrates a fermentation step in an example embodiment of an oil extraction process disclosed herein, wherein a layer of crude oil 410 and a layer of curd 412 are formed. FIG. 6 illustrates a fermentation and separation step in an example embodiment of an oil extraction process disclosed herein, wherein a layer of crude oil 410 and a layer of curd 412 are formed. After formation of the top layer of unfermented coconut milk 310, the unfermented coconut milk 310 ferments to form a layer of crude oil 410 above and/or under a curd layer 412 as seen in FIG. 5 and FIG 6. A bottom layer comprising water 414 is also present. The bottom layer of water 414 can comprise foreign particles such as sludge/precipitate. The layer of crude oil 410 may be observed after about 3 hours from the start of the initial resting period. Optimum formation and separation of the layer of crude oil 410 may be observed after about 8 to about 12 hours from the start of the initial resting period. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG 6., after the fermentation and separation step, a top layer comprising crude oil 410 may be formed with the remaining layers comprising non-oil components such as curd 412, and water 414. The layer of water 414 can comprise foreign particles such as sludge/precipitate. After the fermentation and separation step, the remaining non-oil components such as curd, water and sludge/precipitate are drained from the separatory funnel and discarded. The crude oil is then drained into a separate beaker or container. In some embodiments, the crude oil is drained into a separate beaker or container without being filtered. In an embodiment, the crude oil can be filtered into a separate beaker or container. In another embodiment, after the fermentation and separation step, a layer comprising crude oil 410 may be formed under a curd layer 412 for easier harvesting or extraction. In some embodiments, a crude oil layer 410 can be formed above a curd layer 412. In some embodiments, a crude oil layer 410 can be formed below a curd layer 412. In some embodiments, a crude oil layer 410 can be formed above and below a curd layer 412. In some embodiments, a crude oil layer 410 can be formed above or below a curd layer 412. After being drained, the crude oil undergoes a second rest period. The second rest period can be from about 6 hours to about 36 hours. In some embodiments, the crude oil may be allowed to rest for about 8 to about 24 hours. During this rest period, the crude oil turns from cloudy to clear and can form a small amount of precipitate or sludge at the bottom of the container. The clear oil 510 in the container may be poured off into a bottle as shown in FIG.7 leaving the small amount of precipitate or sludge in the container. In some embodiments, the clear oil 510 is poured off into a bottle without being filtered. In an embodiment, the clear oil 510 can be filtered into a bottle. The clear oil 510 can be the virgin coconut oil of the disclosure. In some embodiments, the clear oil 510 can be colorless. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure can involve triggering the initial fermentation of coconut milk and capitalizing on the fermentation to extract oil molecules from the coconut milk. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the process can be performed in small batches. In some embodiments, the separation of the oil from the coconut milk and the timing required for separation of the oil from the coconut milk can be sufficient to allow for the extraction and purification of small batches of virgin coconut oil. When the process of the present disclosure is performed in small batches, one or more separatory funnels can be used for the extraction of the virgin coconut oil. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the process can be scaled up to an industrial level. In some embodiments, the separation of the oil from the coconut milk and the timing required for separation of the oil from the coconut milk can be sufficient to allow for the extraction and purification of industrial scale size batches. When the process is scaled up to an industrial level, more than one separatory funnel can be used for the extraction of the virgin coconut oil. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, an apparatus for extracting and producing virgin coconut oil on an industrial scale is provided. In some embodiments, the apparatus can include one separatory funnel. In some embodiments, the apparatus can include an array of a plurality of separatory funnels for use in extracting virgin coconut oil.

In some embodiments, no heat is added during and/or after the process of extracting the virgin coconut oil. In some embodiments, no heat is added during and/or after the process of producing the virgin coconut oil. In some embodiments, where no heat is added during and/or after the process of extracting and/ producing the virgin coconut oil, the process of the present disclosure can be denominated a "cold" process. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, no additives are added during or after the process of extracting virgin coconut oil. In some embodiments, in accordance with the present disclosure, additives can include, for example, chemicals, bleaches, acidifying agents, alkalizing agents, other agents, or solvents other than water. In some embodiments, in accordance with the present disclosure, only water, coconut milk, a grater, a separatory funnel, and a beaker are used in the process for extracting virgin coconut oil. In some embodiments, no mechanical means such as a screw press, expeller press, and the like are used to effect extraction of the virgin coconut oil. In some embodiments, the virgin coconut oil does not undergo any type of hydr genation, fractionation, or other post extraction modification. In some embodiments, the virgin coconut oil of the present disclosure can be clear and can have a pleasant, mild to slightly strong coconut odor. In some embodiments, the virgin coconut oil can be colorless. In some embodiments, the virgin coconut oil can be stable at high temperatures with a smoke point of about 177°C and a low level of rancidity. In some embodiments, the virgin coconut oil can include about 86.5% saturated fats, 5.8% unsaturated fat, and 1.8% polyunsaturated fat. In some embodiments, of the saturated fat, the virgin coconut oil can include about 40% to about 55% lauric acid. In some embodiments, the grating, expressing, washing, resting of the washed coconut milk, impure coconut milk, and wash water, and resting of the crude oil are performed at room temperature in the absence of any additives. In some embodiments, the grating, expressing, washing, resting of the washed coconut milk, impure coconut milk, and wash water, and resting of the crude oil are performed at a temperature of about 20°C to about 45°C, about 20°C to about 40°, about 20°C to about 25°C, or about 20°C to about 23.5°C. In some embodiments, the grating, expressing, washing, resting of the washed coconut milk, impure coconut milk, and wash water, and resting of the crude oil are performed at a temperature of about 20 °C. In some embodiments, the grating step and expressing step generate no heat. In some embodiments, the grating step and expressing step generate substantially no heat. In some embodiments, no heat is generated and/or added during the grating, expressing, washing, resting of the washed coconut milk, impure coconut milk, and wash water, and resting of the crude oil. In some embodiments, substantially no heat is generated and/or added during the grating, expressing, washing, resting of the washed coconut milk, impure coconut milk, and wash water, and resting of the crude oil. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure can yield about 350 ml to 400 ml of virgin coconut oil for every liter of coconut milk processed. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure can yield about 140 Liters of virgin coconut oil per day. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure can yield less than 140 Liters of virgin coconut oil per day. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure can yield more than 140 Liters of virgin coconut oil per day. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure allows the virgin coconut oil to retain and preserve all the essential phytochemicals, fats, fatty acids, enzymes, and other beneficial nutrients present in the coconut oil as no heat and no additives (for example, chemicals and solvents other than water) are used to extract and produce the virgin coconut oil. In some embodiments, the process of the present disclosure provides for the extraction and production of virgin coconut oil having a high level of clarity and a pleasant odor, wherein the process preserves essential phytochemicals, fats, fatty acids, enzymes and other beneficial nutrients present in the coconut oil, and wherein the process prevents or does not lead to the degradation of the essential phytochemicals, fats, fatty acids, enzymes, and other beneficial nutrients present in the coconut oil. The above benefits are achieved because no heat and no additives (for example, chemicals and solvents other than water) are used during the extraction and production of the virgin coconut oil. EXAMPLE The outer coat and coir (husk) of a coconut was removed. The coconut was then cracked to remove the coconut water (liquid endosperm), which was then discarded. The coconut was halved exposing the kernel (white flesh) of the coconut. The kernel was then grated and the shredded kernel was run through an expeller machine to separate the coconut milk from the spent kernel. The coconut milk was placed into a 1 L separatory funnel and 200 mL purified water was added to the separatory funnel. The mixture was then shaken manually for 3 min. The shaken mixture then settled forming 3 layers as depicted in FIG. 3 and the water was drawn off from the mixture. Additional water was added and the wash and settle process was repeated three times. Following the third wash, the water was retained in the separatory funnel and the mixture rested for a total time of about 12 hours. After about 2 hours from the start of the resting period, three distinct layers were formed as depicted in FIG. 4. with unfermented coconut milk forming the top layer, a cloudy coconut milk water layer forming the middle layer, and a layer comprising wash water and foreign particles forming the bottom layer. The unfermented coconut milk underwent fermentation to form a top layer of crude oil above a curd layer as depicted in FIG. 6. In some embodiments, a layer of crude coil can be formed below or under a curd layer. After about 3 hours from the start of the resting period, the top layer of crude oil formed above the curd layer was observed as seen in FIG 6 with the remaining layer(s) comprising non-oil components such as water and sludge/precipitate. After about 12 hours from the start of the resting period the water, curd and sludge/precipitate were drained from the separatory funnel and discarded. The crude oil was then drained from the separatory funnel into a beaker/container. The drained crude oil was allowed to rest for about 12 hours until it became clear after which it was poured off into a bottle as shown in FIG. 7 leaving a small amount of precipitate in the beaker. The precipitate was discarded and the clear oil was retained as virgin coconut oil. Aspects of particular embodiments of the present disclosure address at least one aspect, problem, limitation, and/or disadvantage associated with existing methods or processes of virgin coconut oil extraction. While features, aspects, and/or advantages associated with certain embodiments have been described in the disclosure, other embodiments may also exhibit such features, aspects, and/or advantages, and not all embodiments need necessarily exhibit such features, aspects, and/or advantages to fall within the scope of the disclosure.
