Step 2. Preparation of tert-butyl (1-(8-Chloro-1-methyl-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)ethyl)carbamate
tert-butyl (1-(8-Chloro-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)ethyl)carbamate (1.59g, 0.004mol), potassium carbonate (1.69g, 0.012mol), methyl iodide (2.84g, 0.020mol) and 25ml DMF were added to a 100ml three-necked flask. The temperature was raised to 45Â°C and the mixture was stirred for 2h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction was stopped and suction filtration was performed. The filter cake was washed with a large amount of ethyl acetate and solvent was removed under reduced pressure. 50ml of water and 50ml of ethyl acetate were added for extraction, and the aqueous layer was washed with 25 ml x 2 ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution. After drying, the solvent was removed to give 1.53g of a white solid with a yield of 92.6%.
