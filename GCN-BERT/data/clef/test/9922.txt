Step 4
2-(3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)ethyl methanesulfonate
2-(3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl) ethanol (1.00 g, 7.87 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (15 mL) and cooled to 0Â°C, and then triethylamine (1.19 g, 11.8 mmol) and methanesulfonyl chloride (1.35 g, 11.8 mmol) were added. The reaction solution was slowly allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction solution was diluted with dichloromethane (30 mL), followed by adding 1 N hydrochloric acid (20 mL), and allowed to stand still for partition after fully stirring. The organic layer was separated, washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (30 mL) and brine (20 mL) successively, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column chromatography (5:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give 2-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)ethyl methanesulfonate (350 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 22%.
