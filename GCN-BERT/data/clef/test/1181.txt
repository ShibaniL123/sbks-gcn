Statement Regarding Federally Sponsored Research or Development [0002] Not applicable. Appendix [0003] Not applicable. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] Field of the Invention [0005]The present invention pertains to liquid extraction cleaning devices of the type that spray cleaning liquid onto surfaces and thereafter suck the liquid back up to clean such surfaces. More specifically, the present invention pertains to liquid extraction cleaning devices that are used to clean carpet or upholstery and that store the cleaning solution and recovered liquid onboard. [0006] General Background [0007] Some carpet and upholstery extraction cleaners are known in the industry as floor cleaners and some are known as spot cleaners. [0008]A typical floor cleaner comprises a wheeled main unit that rests on the floor and comprises one or more liquid spray nozzles, one or more agitators, and one or more vacuum intake nozzles beneath the main unit. As the main unit of such a floor cleaner is dragged over carpet, liquid spray is discharged from the main unit. The agitator of the main unit is then used to work the liquid into the carpet. Following the agitation, the vacuum intake nozzles of the main unit extract as much of the soiled liquid from the carpet as possible. It is common for floor cleaners to be configured to perform all of these actions simultaneously, albeit on different portions of the carpet. Thus, as the main unit is dragged or self-propelled over carpet, the spraying, agitating, and vacuuming occurs sequentially on any given portion of the carpet. [0009] Spot cleaners tend to be smaller than floor cleaners and are typically used to pick up spills, remove localized stains, or clean furniture upholstery. Some spot cleaners are merely handheld devices that comprise the same general features of the larger floor cleaners, but without the wheels. Other spot cleaners comprise a hand tool that is attached to a main unit via a flexible hose. With such hand tool spot cleaners, the hand tool performs the spraying and the vacuuming and may or may not perform agitation. The vacuum motor and most other necessary components of such hand tool spot cleaners are contained in the main unit. Many floor cleaners are provided with an accessory hand tool and hose that allow the floor cleaners to also serve as spot cleaners. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0010]The present invention is directed to spot cleaner liquid extraction devices. More specifically, the present invention is directed to spot cleaners of the type having a hand tool connected to a main unit via a hose.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0028]A preferred embodiment of a liquid extraction cleaning device in accordance with the invention is shown in Figures 1 -1 1 . The extraction cleaner 10 comprises a main unit 12, a solution tank assembly 14, a recovery tank assembly 16, a flexible vacuum hose 18, and a hand tool 20. [0029] As shown by itself in Figure 4, the main unit 12 comprises a base 22 and an upper shell 24 that collectively form an interior cavity that holds various operational components of the extraction cleaner 10. Such components include a vacuum pump 26, a liquid pump 28 (both shown in Figure 6), and an electrical circuit board assembly (not shown, but attached to the inner surface of the upper shell 24). The vacuum pump 26 and liquid pump 28 are each preferably adapted to operate on standard household voltage. Preferably, the vacuum pump 26 is of the type wherein the rotor drives both a main impeller and a cooling fan. The circuit board assembly probably comprises a transformer and rectifier for supplying the hand tool 20 with low voltage DC power. Other components are also secured to the main unit 12 including a pair of wheels 30, a carrying handle 32, and a tow handle assembly 34. [0030] As shown in Figure 6, the base 22 of the main unit 12 provides mountings for the vacuum pump 26 and the wheels 30. The wheels 30 are mounted to the base 22 on opposite sides of the main unit 12 adjacent to the rear of the main unit. The base 22 also partially forms air ducts 36, which are also formed by duct members that are attached to the base and/or each other. One such duct member covers much of the vacuum pump 26 and comprises a cooling fan air inlet 40 and primary air outlet 42, which are not operatively connected to each other. That same duct member and the base 22 collectively define cooling fan air ducts 44 which are operatively connected to cooling fan air outlets 46 formed on opposite sides of the rear of the base (see Figure 3). A primary air intake duct 48 is also formed and extends upward to an inlet 50 that, as explained below, interfaces with the upper shell 24 of the main unit. The primary air intake duct 48 is operatively connected to the primary air outlet 42 through the impeller of the vacuum pump 26. [0031] As shown in the figures, the upper shell 24 of the main unit 12 is preferably formed by a front shell piece 52, a rear shell piece 54, and a lower facing shell piece 56 (shown in Figure 6). The lower facing shell piece 56 and the front portion of the base 22 collectively form a hose storage receptacle 58. A pair of hose wrap protrusions 60, about which the hose 18 can be wrapped, are mounted between the base 22 and the lower facing shell piece 56 in the hose storage receptacle 58. The upper shell 24 also comprises a recessed cradle 62, a recovery tank support platform 64, and a solution tank support platform 66. The recessed cradle 62 is formed centrally on the front and part of the top of the upper shell 24 between a recovery tank support platform 64 and a solution tank support platform 66 and is adapted to readably hold the hand tool 20 during storage. The rear of the upper shell 24 comprises a pair of cooling air inlets 68 and a primary exhaust outlet 70. A pair of electrical cord wrap protrusions 72 are centrally mounted to the rear of the upper shell 24 for storage of the extraction cleaner's 10 electrical cord (which is not shown but extends through the cord hole 74 provided in the rear of the upper shell and attaches to the circuit board assembly). An opening 76 is centrally formed through the recovery tank support platform 64 and is operatively connected to the inlet 50 of the primary air intake duct 48. Another opening 78 above the recovery tank support platform 64 near the top of the upper shell 24 extends through the upper shell and is attached to a connecting duct assembly 80 (see Figure 6), which operatively connects that opening 78 to the hose 18. Two of concentric cylindrical recesses 82, 84 are centrally formed in the solution tank support platform 66 and a small protrusion 86 extends upwardly from the center of the smaller/deeper liquid transfer recess 84. A small offset hole (not shown) is formed through the upper shell 24 in the liquid transfer recess 84 and is operatively connected to the liquid pump 28 via tubing. The carrying handle 32 has an inverted U-shape and is attach to the upper shell 24 in a manner such that it can partially retract into the interior of the main unit 12 (as shown in Figures 1 , 3, and 4). To a limit, the carrying handle can be extended out of the interior of the main unit 12 (as shown in Figure 2). Still further, a main power switch 88 is secured to the top of the upper shell 24 near the rear of the main unit 12. [0032] As shown in Figures 3 and 5, the towing handle assembly 34 includes a shroud 90 and a telescoping tow handle 92. The shroud 34 attaches to the upper shell 24 and comprises a central opening 94 through which the cord wrap protrusions 72 extend, and that prevents the shroud from blocking the primary exhaust outlet 70. The tow handle 92 comprises a cross member grip 96 and pair of telescoping leg members 98. The grip 96 extends from one of the telescoping leg members 98 to the other. Each telescoping leg member comprises a plurality of leg segments 100. The shroud 90 and the upper shell 24 fix the lower most leg segments in position relative to the upper shell. As such, the cross member grip 96 can be extended up from the shroud 90 (Figure 2) for towing the extraction cleaner 10 via the wheels 30 and, alternatively, lowered such that the majority of the telescoping tow handle 92 is retracted into the shroud (Figure 1 ). When the extraction cleaner is stowed or is not being towed, the front of the bottom surface of the base 22 of the main unit 12 rest on the ground to prevent the extraction cleaner from sliding around on its wheels 30. [0033] As shown by itself in Figure 8, the solution tank assembly 14 of the extraction cleaner 10 comprises a solution tank 102, a fluid communication assembly 104, and a locking ring 106. The solution tank 102 is preferably translucent plastic and comprises handgrip indentations 108 and a central opening 1 10 at its base that is preferably treaded. The fluid communication assembly 104 comprises offset air vent tube 1 12 that is configured to operatively communicate with the vent recess 82 on the solution tank support platform 66 of the main unit 12 in a manner such that air can enter the solution tank 102 through the vent tube 1 12 above the level of liquid in the tank. The fluid communication assembly 104 also comprises a spring biased check valve 1 14 that enables fluid within the solution tank to exit through the valve when it's open. The check valve 1 14 is configured to open when the solution tank assembly 14 is placed onto the solution tank support platform 66. More specifically, the lowermost end of the check valve comprises an annular seal 1 16 that slides into the smaller liquid transfer recess 84, and the protrusion 86 in the recess forces the check valve open 1 14. Thus, when attached to the main unit 12, liquid in the solution tank 102 is in fluid communication with the liquid pump 28 of the main unit, and air is able to fill the tank a liquid is drawn out of the tank by the pump. The locking ring 106 releasably connects fluid communication assembly 104 of the solution tank assembly 14 to the central opening 1 10 at the base of the solution tank 102 to allow the tank to be refilled easily. [0034]The recovery tank assembly 16 includes a recovery tank 1 18, a deflector 120, and a float assembly 122. The recovery tank 1 18 is preferably is preferably translucent and comprises a pair of handgrip indentations 124, a central opening 126 at its base that is preferably threaded, and an intake opening 128 on its upper rear wall. The central opening preferably is not perfectly circular and includes flat portion 129. The deflector 120 is connected to the intake opening 128 and is configured to deflect fluid (air and extracted liquid) away from the float assembly 122 and against the outer walls of the recovery tank 1 18. When the recovery tank assembly 16 is placed on the recovery tank support platform 64 of the main unit, the intake opening 128 of the recovery tank 1 18 is operatively connected to the connecting duct assembly 80 of the main unit, which draws extracted liquid and air into the recovery tank 1 18. The float assembly 122 comprises an air tube 130, a locking ring 132, and a float 134. The float assembly 122 is removably attached to the central opening 126 of the recovery tank 1 18 via the locking ring 132. Notably, the flange at the base of the air tube 130 comprises a flat portion 136 that must be aligned with the flat portion 129 of the central opening 126 of the recovery tank 1 18 in order to attach the float assembly 122 to the recovery tank 1 18. This ensures that air tube 130 is oriented with its intake facing away from the deflector 120. When the recovery tank assembly 16 is placed on the recovery tank support platform 64 of the main unit 12, the air tube 130 is operatively connected to the impeller of the vacuum pump 26 via the primary air intake duct 48 of the main unit 12, thereby allowing air to be drawn out of the recovery tank 1 18 to thereby draw air and extracted liquid into the tank. The float 132 encircles the air tube 130 and, in a conventional manner, is configured to rise with the level of liquid in the recovery tank 1 18 until it reaches a maximum limit, at which time is seals off the upper end of the air tube to prevent further intake of fluid. [0035]The flexible vacuum hose 18 connects the hand tool 20 to the connecting duct assembly 80 of the main unit 12 and forms and surrounds a hose passageway. As such that the impeller of the vacuum pump 26 is operatively connected to the hose passageway. An electrical cable 138 and a liquid supply tube 140 (shown in Figure 9) extend through the hose passageway. The liquid supply tube is operatively connected to the high side of the liquid pump 28 of the main unit 12. The electrical cable 138 is connected to the circuit board of the main unit 12 in a manner such that the electrical cable is feed with low voltage direct current (preferably under 25 volts). The electrical cable 138 preferably comprises three wires, namely positive, negative, and a relay signal wire. Because power transmission via low voltage requires higher amperage, running the electrical cable 138 in the hose passageway rather than spirally in the hose wall or external to the hose minimizes power loss due to wire resistance. Additionally, running both the electrical cable 138 and the liquid supply tube 140 in the hose passageway eliminates routing issues and allows the vacuum hose 18 manufactured relatively inexpensively. [0036] As shown in Figure 9, the hand tool 20 comprises a housing 142, a spray nozzle 144, a spray trigger 146, an agitator assembly 148, a vacuum inlet port 150, a grip portion 152, and an agitator switch 154 (the latter shown in Figures 1 and 2). The end of the grip portion 152 is connected to the flexible vacuum hose 18, thereby connecting the hose passageway to the vacuum inlet port 150. A portion of the housing 142 adjacent to the vacuum inlet port 150 is preferably translucent such that liquid passing into the vacuum inlet port can be observed. The spray nozzle 144 is preferably directly connected to the liquid supply tube 140 that extends through the vacuum hose 18 such that when the liquid pump 28 of the main unit 12 operates, cleaning solution liquid is sprayed from the spray nozzle in a fan-like pattern. However, the spray trigger 146 is connected to the electrical cable 138 and operates an electrical switch in the hand tool 20 and sends the positive low voltage down the signal wire of the electrical cable to the circuit board of the main unit 12 when the trigger is depressed. Through a relay, the circuit board only supplies the higher AC power to the liquid pump 28 when it receives that signal. The agitator switch 154 is also connected to the electrical cable 138, but is preferably a toggle switch that selectively supplies electrical power to the agitator assembly 148. The various components of the hand tool 20 are positioned such that as a person pulls the grip portion 152 of the tool and drags the remainder of the tool along upholstery or carpet, the hand tool will spray cleaning liquid on the fabric, then agitate that portion of the fabric, and thereafter extract the soiled liquid from the fabric, all in a single motion. [0037] The agitator assembly 148 is shown in Figures 10 and 1 1 and comprises a fixed brush ring 156, a low voltage electric motor 158, a motion converter 160, and a reciprocating agitator 162. The fixed brush ring 156 preferably comprises side brushes 164 that are preferably oriented such that they extend at angle relative to the surface being cleaned, and several rows of non-angled brushes 164 in front of and behind the reciprocating agitator 162. The electric motor 158 supplies rotational power to the motion converter 160 when agitator switch 154 of the hand tool 20 supplies the agitator assembly 148 with power. The motion converter 160 converts that rotational power into linearly reciprocating power, which thereafter is converted once again into pivotally reciprocation of the agitator 162. [0038] The main power switch 88 on the main unit 12 controls the electrical power supply to the rest of extraction cleaner 10. When set to the on position, the main power supply supplies power to the circuit board which then activates the vacuum pump 26. Thus, when the main switch 88 is on, the vacuum pump operates 26, and when it's off, nothing operates. However, when the main power switch 88 on, the circuit board provides low voltage DC power to the electrical cable 138 in the hose passageway. Although the vacuum inlet port 150 of the hand tool 20 will always be sucking in air unless the main power switch 88 switched off or the recovery tank assembly 16 is full, the agitation and liquid can be controlled independently of each other from the hand tool using the spray trigger 146 and agitator switch 154. [0039] In view of the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the invention has several advantages over the prior art.
