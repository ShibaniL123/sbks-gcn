TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to a circular stapler and a staple head assembly thereof, which belongs to the field of medical appliances. BACKGROUND A circular stapler is a kind of medical appliance often used in surgical operation of physiological tissues such as digestive tracts. These kinds of staplers often use a type of axial inner stapling. In anastomosis, two tissues move towards each other and form a circular anastomotic ring inside the tissues. The appliance is capable of discharging the tissue blood generated in the operation together with the contents, which facilitates healing of the tissues after surgery. Currently, the circular stapler includes a staple body and an anvil assembly for mating with the staple body. The staple body includes an annular staple cartridge and a cutter both located at a far end thereof. The anvil assembly includes a cone-shaped anvil, an anvil cap fixed on top of the anvil assembly, an annular cutting pad set inside the anvil and an anvil shaft for connecting the staple body. The anvil assembly is connected to the staple body through the anvil shaft, and is capable of conducting reciprocating movement. In anastomosis, firstly, the anvil of the anvil assembly and the staple cartridge of the staple body can tightly clamp two tissues, and then the two tissues can be anastomosed by the staples sent from the staple cartridge and associated with the anvil. At the same time, the cutter is pushed out to cut off the excessive tissues. Generally, the physiological tissues such as digestive tracts anastomosed by the circular stapler, the tissues are firstly cut by the surgical cutter. The surgical cutter will leave staples on the severed tissues. When using the circular stapler to anastomose the tissues, such staples would likely cause that the anastomotic cross does not be successfully cut off, but also it will drag the tissues. As a result, at the new anastomotic position, the tissues are torn off or the new staples can not be normally formed. SUMMARY In an embodiment, the present disclosure provides a circular stapler and a staple head assembly of the circular stapler. In an embodiment, the present disclosure discloses a circular stapler including: a staple body comprising an annular staple cartridge and an annular cutter located at a distal end of the circular stapler, the annular staple cartridge comprising a plurality of staple holes at an end face thereof;an anvil assembly comprising an annular anvil for mating with the annular staple cartridge, an annular cutting pad for mating with the annular cutter and an anvil shaft for being moveably connected to the staple body, the annular cutting pad being arranged between the anvil shaft and the annular anvil;wherein when the staple body and the anvil assembly are closed, the annular staple cartridge is associated with the annular anvil and the annular cutting pad to form at least two connected fixing spaces having height difference. In an embodiment, the present disclosure discloses a staple head assembly including: an annular staple cartridge comprising a plurality of staple holes at an end face thereof; an anvil assembly comprising an annular anvil, an annular cutting pad and an anvil shaft, the annular cutting pad being arranged between the anvil shaft and the annular anvil;wherein the annular staple cartridge is associated with the annular anvil and the annular cutting pad to form at least two connected fixing spaces having height difference in order to tightly clamp two tissues. In comparison with prior art, one or more embodiments may facilitate better fixing the cut staples for easily cutting. An embodiment facilitates forming a buffer between the tissues near the new formed staples and the tissues near the severed staples in order to avoid lateral slipping, thereby reducing dragging the tissues on the end face of the anvil.

ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS Detailed description of the present application will be depicted in combination with embodiments shown in figures. It should be noted that the present application should not be restricted to the embodiments, and modifications of structure, method and function to those of ordinary skill in the art according to the embodiments are all included within the protection scope of the present application. The words used to express locations or directions in describing embodiments adopt the appliance operator as reference. An end near the operator is a proximal end and an end away from the operator is a distal end. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, in accordance with a first embodiment of the present application, a circular stapler includes a staple body 10 and an anvil assembly 20 for mating with the staple body 10. The staple body 10 includes an annular staple cartridge 101 and an annular cutter 103 located at the distal end thereof. The annular staple cartridge 101 includes a plurality of staple holes 1011 at an end face thereof. The anvil assembly 20 includes an annular anvil 201, an anvil cap 203 fixed on top of the annular anvil 201, an annular cutting pad 205 set inside the annular anvil 201 and an anvil shaft 207 for moveably connecting to the staple body 10. The annular cutting pad 205 is arranged between the anvil shaft 207 and the annular anvil 201. In anastomosis, firstly, the annular anvil 201 of the anvil assembly 20 and the annular staple cartridge 101 of the staple body 10 tightly clamp two tissues. Then, excessive tissues after stapling are cut off by the annular cutter 103. At the same time, the annular staple cartridge 101 sents out staples, associated with the annular anvil 201, to anastomotic the two tissues. It is noted that, in the first embodiment of the present application, the anvil assembly 20 includes at least one stable ring 105 protruding beyond an end surface between the staple holes 1011 of the annular staple cartridge 101 and the annular cutter 103. The stable ring 105 will be described in detail in combination with FIGS. 3 and 4. Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, in the first embodiment of the present application, the stable ring 105 is arranged at an inner surface of the annular staple cartridge 101 and extends beyond the annular staple cartridge 101. A distance between an end face of the annular cutting pad 205 and the end face of the annular staple cartridge 101 is greater than a distance between an end face of the annular anvil 201 and the end face of the annular staple cartridge 101. In other words, the annular cutting pad 205 is higher than the annular anvil 201 relative to a horizontal plane. In an embodiment, a distance between the end face of the annular cutting pad 205 and an end face of the stable ring 105 is less than or equal to the distance between the end face of the annular anvil 201 and the end face of the annular staple cartridge 101. Under this condition, when clamping the tissues, the clamp force of the annular cutting pad 205 and the stable ring 105 is greater than or equal to that of the annular anvil 201 and the annular staple cartridge 101. As a result, lateral slipping of the severed staples and tissues during cutting and stapling may be avoided or reduced, thereby reducing dragging the tissues on the end surface of the anvil 201. In an embodiment, a center point of the stable ring 105 is coaxial with a center point of the annular staple cartridge 101. The staple body 10 also includes a hollow shaft 107. An axis of the hollow shaft 107 is coaxial with the center point of the stable ring 105 and the center point of the annular staple cartridge 101. The anvil shaft 207 is movably connected to the hollow shaft 107 and is capable of conducting reciprocating movement with respect to the hollow shaft 107. In an embodiment, the annular cutter 103 is arranged between the hollow shaft 107 and the annular staple cartridge 101, and the annular cutter 103 clings to an inner wall of the annular staple cartridge 101. In an embodiment, a distance between a sharp point of the annular cutter 103 and a horizontal plane is lower than a distance between the annular staple cartridge 101 and the horizontal plane. In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3, an angle between the end face and the inner wall of the annular anvil 201 is smaller than an angle between the stable ring 105 and the end face of the annular staple cartridge 101. In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4, the angle between the end face and the inner wall of the annular anvil 201 is almost the same as the angle between the stable ring 105 and the end face of the annular staple cartridge 101. Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, in accordance with a second embodiment of the present application, a circular stapler includes a staple body 10 and an anvil assembly 20 for mating with the staple body 10. The staple body 10 includes an annular staple cartridge 101 and an annular cutter 103 located at the distal end. The annular staple cartridge 101 includes a plurality of staple holes 1011 at its end surface. The anvil assembly 20 includes an annular anvil 201, an anvil cap 203 fixed on top of the annular anvil 201, an annular cutting pad 205 set inside the annular anvil 201 and an anvil shaft 207 for moveably connecting to the staple body 10. The annular cutting pad 205 is arranged between the anvil shaft 207 and the annular anvil 201. In anastomosis, firstly, the annular anvil 201 of the anvil assembly 20 and the annular staple cartridge 101 of the staple body 10 tightly clamp two tissues. Then, excessive tissues after stapling are cut off by the annular cutter 103. At the same time, the annular staple cartridge 101 sents out staples, associated with the annular anvil 201, to anastomose the two tissues. It is noted that, in the second embodiment of the present application, the annular staple cartridge 101 includes a concave portion 105′ between the staple holes 1011 of the annular staple cartridge 101 and the annular cutter 103. The end face of the annular staple cartridge 101 is higher than a bottom face of the concave portion 105′. The annular cutting pad 205 extends beyond the annular anvil 201 along a direction towards the proximal end. The concave portion 105′ will be described in detail in combination with FIGS. 7 and 8. Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, in the second embodiment of the present application, the concave portion 105′ is arranged at an inner surface of the annular staple cartridge 101. A distance between an end face of the annular cutting pad 205 and the end face of the annular staple cartridge 101 is less than a distance between an end face of the annular anvil 201 and the end face of the annular staple cartridge 101. In other words, the annular anvil 201 is higher than the annular cutting pad 205 relative to a horizontal plane. In an embodiment, a distance between the end face of the annular cutting pad 205 and the bottom face of the concave portion 105′ is less than or equal to the distance between the end face of the annular anvil 201 and the end face of the annular staple cartridge 101. Under this condition, when clamping the tissues, the clamp force of the annular cutting pad 205 and the concave portion 105′ is greater than or equal to that of the annular anvil 201 and the annular staple cartridge 101. As a result, lateral slipping of the severed staples and tissues during cutting and stapling may be avoided or reduced, thereby reducing dragging the tissues on the end surface of the anvil 201. In an embodiment, a center point of the concave portion 105′ is coaxial with a center point of the annular staple cartridge 101. The staple body 10 also includes a hollow shaft 107. An axis of the hollow shaft 107 is coaxial with the center point of the concave portion 105′ and the center point of the annular staple cartridge 101. The anvil shaft 207 is movably connected to the hollow shaft 107 and is capable of conducting reciprocating movement with respect to the hollow shaft 107. In an embodiment, the annular cutter 103 is arranged between the hollow shaft 107 and the annular staple cartridge 101, and the annular cutter 103 clings to an inner wall of the annular staple cartridge 101. In an embodiment, a distance between a sharp point of the annular cutter 103 and a horizontal plane is lower than a distance between the annular staple cartridge 101 and the horizontal plane. In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 7, the concave portion 105′ includes a bottom face and a peripheral face connected to the annular staple cartridge 101. An angle between the peripheral face and the bottom face is an acute angle or an obtuse angle. A prominent part of the annular cutting pad 205 extending beyond the annular anvil 201 has an inclined face. An angle between the inclined face and the end face of the annular cutting pad 205 is an acute angle or an obtuse angle. In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 8, the concave portion 105′ includes the bottom face and a peripheral face connected to the annular staple cartridge 101. An angle between the peripheral face and the bottom face is a right angle. A prominent part of the annular cutting pad 205 extending beyond the annular anvil 201 has an inclined face. An angle between the inclined face and the end face of the annular cutting pad 205 is a right angle as well. In this way, when the staple body 10 and the anvil assembly 20 are closed, the annular staple cartridge 101 associated with the annular anvil 201 and the annular cutting pad 205 forms a connected slit having at least two bending sections. Tissues in the slit will be fixed in a staggered manner. Two fixing spaces will be generated to fix the tissues and the staples respectively, in order to restrict tissue slipping. A larger space can be formed between the two fixing spaces so that the tissues can fill in the space when closing, which can avoid the tissues being squeezed too much and limit its slipping as well. As to the defects of the existing technologies, it is impossible to completely cut off the staples either by changing materials or reducing the annular cutting pad to a minimum thickness. Even if the staples can be cut off, it happens after the annular cutting pad has been cut off, which means that tissue dragging has already been done. An embodiment of circular staplers of the present disclosure includes a stable ring 105 or a concave portion 105′ which can be used to better fix the severed staples for easily cutting. An embodiment facilitates forming a buffer between the tissues near the new formed staples and the tissues near the severed staples in order to avoid lateral slipping, thereby reducing dragging the tissues on the end face of the anvil.
