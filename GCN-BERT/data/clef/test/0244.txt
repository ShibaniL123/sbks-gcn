Step 5: 2-oxo-2-((1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)ethyl 2-(2-methyl-1 H-indol-3-yl)acetate
(2-Methyl-indol-3-yl)-acetic acid (70.3 mg, 0.4 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (6 mL), and added DCC (72.6 mg, 0.4 mmol) and DMAP (10.0 mg, 0.08 mmol) followed by N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (80.0 mg, 0.4 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The mixture was left stirring for overnight and then filtered over cotton to remove the bulk of DCU and washed with NH4Cl, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. Purification by column chromatography (75% EtOAc in PE) yielded 79.4 mg of pure title compound (55%).
