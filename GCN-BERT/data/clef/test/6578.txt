The vertical drive motor 132 is mounted to one of the vertical supports 130. The vertical drive motor 132 is configured to rotate the frame 120 and passenger seat 122 up to 360째. Accordingly, the passenger in the seat 122 is able to face forward, upward, backward, downward, etc. For example, as is illustrated in FIG. 2, the frame 120 and the seat 122 are rotated so that the passenger seat 122 is facing upward. As is illustrated in FIG. 3, the frame 120 and seat are rotated so that the passenger seat 122 is facing downward. Additionally, a pair of passenger guards 136 is disposed on each side of the frame 120 to protect the passenger from the movable parts of the vehicle 100. Referring to FIGS. 4A-6, the vehicle 100 includes an independent two wheel drive system located on a central axis of the platform 110. The independent two wheel drive system includes two separate and independent drive tires 150 disposed on the central axis of the circular base 114. The drive system also includes two independent electric motors 152/154, respectively connected to each of the drive tires 150. The electric motors 152/154 independently control the drive tires 150 allowing the drive tires to move the vehicle 100 forward, backward or turn/rotate 360째. The drive tires 150 and the motors 152/154 are positioned within the circular base 114. Specifically, the drive tires 150 are mounted below the top surface 112 of the platform 110 and extend through an open bottom of the platform to a surface (i.e., the ground) below the vehicle 100. Furthermore, the drive system includes one or more battery trays 160 positioned within the base 114 underneath the platform 112 to power the motors 152/154. The vehicle 100 also includes one or more speakers. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, the vehicle 100 includes a pair of speakers 180 disposed on each side of the passenger seat 122. A plurality of lights (e.g., LED lights) is positioned on the seat frame 120 and the platform 110. The lights perform a variety of functions including designating teams (e.g., by color), indicating vehicle state (e.g., on/off), indicating when actions or functions have happened or been performed, and indicating active targets. Additionally, in accordance with certain exemplary aspects of the invention, a laser gun 190 may be mounted on the frame 120 of the vehicle allowing the driver to tilt the seat to aim the laser gun in any direction. The laser gun 190, for example, includes an infrared light gun. Thus, the laser light emitted from the gun functions as a visual aiming tool. FIGS. 6 and 8 more clearly illustrate the laser gun 190 mounted on the frame 120. Furthermore, the vehicle 100 includes one or more targets configured to interact with the laser gun 190 from another vehicle. Preferably, the vehicle 100 includes a plurality of targets as illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 7. Specifically, as is illustrated in FIG. 4A, the vehicle 100 includes a rear target 192 positioned on a back of the passenger seat 122, front targets 194 positioned on or near each of the vehicle controllers 140, and a foot rest target 196 positioned on the vehicle foot rest 126. Additionally, as is illustrated in FIG. 7, the vehicle 100 includes a plurality of platform targets 193 positioned around the vehicle platform 110. FIG. 9 illustrates a system 900 according to an exemplary aspect of the present invention. The system 900 includes one or more of the vehicles 100 detailed above. Additionally, the system 900 includes a ride controller 902, which communicates with the one or more vehicles 100. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 9, the system 900 includes a plurality of vehicles 100. The controller 902 is configured to operate the vehicle without passenger control. Specifically, the controller is configured to start the vehicle, time the ride, and turn off the vehicle automatically when a ride attendant starts the ride. The controller 902 communicates wirelessly with each of the vehicles. During the ride, the controller 902 is able to take temporary control of any or all of the vehicles 100 and control the movement and operation of the vehicle(s). Specifically, the controller 902 can send one or all of the vehicles 100 through wireless drive commands sending the car in any direction or at any angle. Alternatively, the controller 902 may have complete control over one or more of the vehicles 100 such that the entire ride of the vehicle(s) 100 is out of the user/passenger's control. The controller 902 may use a program to run the vehicle(s) in a series of ride motions using wireless drive controls. Furthermore, during the ride, the ride controller 902 can play music or provide voice commands through the speakers 180. Specifically, the ride controller 902 can provide a current status, scoring opportunities, scores, and a variety of ride information to the passenger during a ride or game. The system 900 may be incorporated into an arena or designated area. Using, for example, radio-frequency identification (RFID), the controller 902 can turn on/off specific areas of the arena allowing certain things to happen when one of the vehicles reaches the specific area. For example, RFID tags can be placed in the floor for a variety of uses. For example, a tag can be placed in several areas of the floor so that when a light shines on it (blue light for example) the first vehicle to get to that spot will get shields for 30 seconds where no one can hit the vehicle sensors. Each vehicle 100 includes a ride transponder 170 positioned within the base 114 beneath the top surface 112 of the drive platform 110. The wireless transponder 170 receives operational information from the ride controller and broadcasts the operational information back to the ride controller. FIG. 10 illustrates a system 1000 according to another exemplary aspect of the present invention. The system 1000 includes a ride controller 1002, which wirelessly communicates with one or more vehicles 1004 (the vehicles 1004 illustrated in FIG. 10 correspond to the vehicle 100 illustrated in FIGS. 1-8). In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 10, the system 1000 includes a plurality of vehicles 1004. Each of the vehicles 1004 includes one or more targets 1006 disposed thereon (the targets 1006 are configured as detailed above in FIGS. 4A-7). For example, as detailed above, the target 1006 may be positioned on a back of the passenger seat 122. Alternatively, one or more targets may be positioned on the frame 120 or the drive platform 110. The system 1000 also includes one or more separate targets 1008. The separate targets 1008 may be stationary or movable. The systems and vehicles described above may be used in several different modes. In a first exemplary mode, the vehicle(s) 100 may be used as a user operated drive platform. As a ride (e.g., amusement ride), the vehicle 100 allows the passenger to drive the vehicle to any area on a relatively flat surface. In addition, the passenger/driver can also perform tricks with the combination of the drive and flip mechanisms. That is, the passenger/driver may control the independent two wheel drive system and the vertical drive system using the vehicle controller 140. The independent two wheel drive system and the vertical drive system provide an enhanced user control system and freedom of movement allowing the user to drive the vehicle 100 while facing forward, backward, downward, upward, or while flipping. Additionally, the driver may spin the vehicle 100 with the passenger seat 122 in any position, including simultaneously flipping the passenger seat 122 and spinning the vehicle platform 110. In a variation of the drive platform, the user operated vehicle 100 may be incorporated into a game in which points are accumulated for performing a specific trick during a specific time frame. The user may gain points by performing any of a variety of user selected tricks or a required trick communicated to the user through the ride controller 1002/1002. As detailed above, the ride controller 1002/1002 may temporarily take control of the vehicle 100 to perform a specific trick. In another mode, the vehicle 100 may be used as a ride platform. In this mode, the operation of the vehicle 100 is completely at the control of the ride controller 1002/1002. That is, the vehicle 100 is operated entirely by the ride controller without user intervention. The controller 1002/1002 uses pre-programmed routines to make the vehicle(s) perform a variety of movements while the rider has no control of the vehicle. In a third mode, the vehicle 100 is used in a laser gun game, incorporated in the system 1000 illustrated in FIG. 10. The vehicle 100 is operated by the user, as in the first mode described above. Additionally, a laser gun is mounted to the vehicle (e.g., on the frame 120 or seat 122) allowing the motions of the vehicle to be used to aim the laser gun. Accordingly, the laser gun can be aimed forward, backward, upward, downward, etc., by rotating the passenger seat 122 and/or the platform 110. The laser gun point in the same direction as the passenger/driver of the vehicle 100. As detailed above with respect to FIG. 10, a variety of targets 1006/1008 may be provided for the user. For example, targets 1006 may be mounted on each vehicle 100 so that multiple vehicles may attempt to shoot at one another. Additionally, separate stationary or movable targets 1008 are provided around the arena. The targets 1008 may be positioned on the walls or ceilings of the arena or may be disposed as standing targets throughout the arena playing area. The targets 1008 are targetable by the passenger/driver by driving, turning and tilting the driving platform 110 of the vehicle 100. The targets 1008 may be turned on constantly throughout a game sequence or may be turned on/off during the game by the ride controller 1002. The targets 1008 include lights 1010 indicating when the targets 1008 are active. This allows the attraction to have a scoring component where the drivers/passengers can score points for shooting the targets 1006/1008. The game can also allow for bonus points added by scoring when the passenger seat 122 is in unique positions (e.g., upside down, etc.) for increased difficulty. Additionally, the RFID system, described above, can allow for increased points or bonus points for being in certain locations in the arena. Moreover, in addition to scoring points, vehicle target hits can also effect an opponents vehicle. That is, when a vehicle is hit in, for example, the passenger seat targets 192/196, the frame cannot be spun/rotated for some specified period of time (e.g., 10 seconds). This is in addition to scoring points for the hit. Similarly, if either of the front targets 194 is hit, the vehicle cannot be moved for a period of time. When the platform targets 193 are hit, not only are points scored, the vehicle will perform motions not controlled by the driver. In another example, when a single rider hits all three front (or back) targets, the vehicle they hit will flip and spin at the same time. If a rear target is hit, the hit vehicle stands the driver upside down and slowly spin him. The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are to be included within the scope of the following claims. 1.
