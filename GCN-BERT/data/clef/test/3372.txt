TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to medical implants. BACKGROUND The lubricating fluid (synovial fluid) reduces friction between the articular cartilage and other tissues in a joint and lubricates and cushions the bone and tissue components of the joint during movement. If the lubricating fluid is negatively affected and/or the joint articular cartilage usually covering the bone of the joint is damaged, in most cases due to older age and/or continuing extensive or abnormal strain on human or mammal joints (e.g. knee joint, hip joint), this can result in a degenerative joint disease (also known as osteoarthritis) characterized by a painful inflammation of the joint. Upon pathological reduction and change of composition of the lubricating fluid within the joint space, which consists of the articulating surfaces of the adjacent bones with the joint being stabilized and encompassed by the joint capsule and the synovial membrane, the lubricating fluid can no longer perform its usual task, i.e. lubrication of joint areas and shock absorption, together with the articular cartilage. If the articular cartilage is severely damaged due to osteoarthritis or the like and/or the synovial fluid is reduced or altered in its composition reducing its potential to lower friction within the joint, the articulating surfaces are subjected to high friction and increased wear causing a painful inflammation of the joint. This can result in serious restraints of movement, especially in walking and standing, which further augment degenerative processes of the joint. Degenerative joint disease is highly prevalent in the western world, with this disease being one of the leading causes for chronic disability in Europe and the US. Patients with osteoarthritis require a regular long term treatment by which lubricating fluid is introduced into the affected joint, which, on the one hand, re-stores the physiological functionality of the damaged joint as far as possible and, on the other hand, involves as little extra stress as possible—both physical and psychological—for the patient. A known standard therapy is periodical extracorporeal injection of synthetic lubricating fluid into the joint space by a syringe in order to substitute the absent physiological lubricating fluid. In such conventional treatment it is inconvenient for the patient to deliver the lubricating fluid at regular time intervals through the skin and the joint capsule into the joint by way of a syringe. Also, this may cause injuries to the skin and the joint capsule, which increases the risk of severe infections of the delicate joint tissues. Therefor, an injection may not be performed more often than every 6 months. Artificial joints have been an important part restoring the functionality of the natural joints of patients suffering from joint osteoarthritis and fractured and damaged joints. Among the most successful material combinations is the ceramic and polymer combination called the Charnley type joint. This prosthesis type however, has a limited life span of 15-20 years due to wear of the polymer component. The particles created from the polymer wear triggers a macrophage reaction which has been found affects the fixation of the prosthesis in the femoral bone and in worst cases makes the prosthesis come loose. Loosening of prosthesis is the number one reason for having to redo hip joint surgery. Since the polymer material of the prosthetic Acetabular cup is relatively soft, the material need to be of considerable thickness for being stiff enough, for enabling fixation of the cup and for resisting the wear from the contact with the prosthetic caput femur. The use of harder materials in the Acetabular cup have the disadvantages of creating sounds when walking which propagates out of the body, furthermore harder material do not create the desired elastic properties which is needed for reduce strains placed on the fixations of the prosthetic parts against the natural bone tissue.

In the drawing figures, like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements throughout the several figures. It will be appreciated that these figures are for illustration only and are not in any way restricting the scope of the invention. Thus, any references to direction, such as “up” or “down”, are only referring to the directions shown in the figures. Also, any dimensions etc. shown in the figures are for illustration purposes.

All examples herein should be seen as part of the general description and therefor possible to combine in any way in general terms. Functional hip movements are to be understood as movements of the hip that at least partly correspond to the natural movements of the hip. On some occasions the natural movements of the hip joint might be somewhat limited or altered after hip joint surgery, which makes the functional hip movements of a hip joint with artificial surfaces somewhat different than the functional hip movements of a natural hip joint. The functional position of an implantable medical hip device or prosthesis is the position in which the hip joint can perform functional hip movements.

FIG. 34 illustrates a system for treating a disease comprising an apparatus 10 of the present invention placed in the abdomen of a patient. An implanted energy-transforming device 1002 is adapted to supply energy consuming components of the apparatus with energy via a power supply line 1003. An external energy-transmission device 1004 for non-invasively energizing the apparatus 10 transmits energy by at least one wireless energy signal. The implanted energy-transforming device 1002 transforms energy from the wireless energy signal into electric energy which is supplied via the power supply line 1003.

Such a carrier signal may include digital, analogue or a combination of digital and analogue signals. In this case, the wireless energy signal includes an analogue or a digital signal, or a combination of an analogue and digital signal. Generally speaking, the energy-transforming device 1002 is provided for transforming wireless energy of a first form transmitted by the energy-transmission device 1004 into energy of a second form, which typically is different from the energy of the first form. The implanted apparatus 10 is operable in response to the energy of the second form. The energy-transforming device 1002 may directly power the apparatus with the second form energy, as the energy-transforming device 1002 transforms the first form energy transmitted by the energy-transmission device 1004 into the second form energy. The system may further include an implantable accumulator, wherein the second form energy is used at least partly to charge the accumulator. Alternatively, the wireless energy transmitted by the energy-transmission device 1004 may be used to directly power the apparatus, as the wireless energy is being transmitted by the energy-transmission device 1004. Where the system comprises an operation device for operating the apparatus, as will be described below, the wireless energy transmitted by the energy-transmission device 1004 may be used to directly power the operation device to create kinetic energy for the operation of the apparatus. The wireless energy of the first form may comprise sound waves and the energy-transforming device 1002 may include a piezo-electric element for transforming the sound waves into electric energy. The energy of the second form may comprise electric energy in the form of a direct current or pulsating direct current, or a combination of a direct current and pulsating direct current, or an alternating current or a combination of a direct and alternating current. Normally, the apparatus comprises electric components that are energized with electrical energy. Other implantable electric components of the system may be at least one voltage level guard or at least one constant current guard connected with the electric components of the apparatus. Optionally, one of the energy of the first form and the energy of the second form may comprise magnetic energy, kinetic energy, sound energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, electromagnetic energy, photo energy, nuclear energy or thermal energy. Preferably, one of the energy of the first form and the energy of the second form is non-magnetic, non-kinetic, non-chemical, non-sonic, non-nuclear or non-thermal. The energy-transmission device may be controlled from outside the patient's body to release electromagnetic wireless energy, and the released electromagnetic wireless energy is used for operating the apparatus. Alternatively, the energy-transmission device is controlled from outside the patient's body to release non-magnetic wireless energy, and the released non-magnetic wireless energy is used for operating the apparatus. The external energy-transmission device 1004 also includes a wireless remote control having an external signal transmitter for transmitting a wireless control signal for non-invasively controlling the apparatus. The control signal is received by an implanted signal receiver which may be incorporated in the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 or be separate there from. The wireless control signal may include a frequency, amplitude, or phase modulated signal or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the wireless control signal includes an analogue or a digital signal, or a combination of an analogue and digital signal. Alternatively, the wireless control signal comprises an electric or magnetic field, or a combined electric and magnetic field. The wireless remote control may transmit a carrier signal for carrying the wireless control signal. Such a carrier signal may include digital, analogue or a combination of digital and analogue signals. Where the control signal includes an analogue or a digital signal, or a combination of an analogue and digital signal, the wireless remote control preferably transmits an electromagnetic carrier wave signal for carrying the digital or analogue control signals. FIG. 35 illustrates the system of FIG. 34 in the form of a more generalized block diagram showing the apparatus 10, the energy-transforming device 1002 powering the apparatus 10 via power supply line 1003, and the external energy-transmission device 1004, The patient's skin 1005, generally shown by a vertical line, separates the interior of the patient to the right of the line from the exterior to the left of the line. FIG. 36 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 35, except that a reversing device in the form of an electric switch 1006 operable for example by polarized energy also is implanted in the patient for reversing the apparatus 10. When the switch is operated by polarized energy the wireless remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004 transmits a wireless signal that carries polarized energy and the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 transforms the wireless polarized energy into a polarized current for operating the electric switch 1006. When the polarity of the current is shifted by the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 the electric switch 1006 reverses the function performed by the apparatus 10. FIG. 37 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 35, except that an operation device 1007 implanted in the patient for operating the apparatus 10 is provided between the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 and the apparatus 10. This operation device can be in the form of a motor 1007, such as an electric servomotor. The motor 1007 is powered with energy from the implanted energy-transforming device 1002, as the remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004 transmits a wireless signal to the receiver of the implanted energy-transforming device 1002. FIG. 38 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 35, except that it also comprises an operation device in the form of an assembly 1008 including a motor/pump unit 1009 and a fluid reservoir 1010 is implanted in the patient. In this case the apparatus 10 is hydraulically operated, i.e. hydraulic fluid is pumped by the motor/pump unit 1009 from the fluid reservoir 1010 through a conduit 1011 to the apparatus 10 to operate the apparatus, and hydraulic fluid is pumped by the motor/pump unit 1009 back from the apparatus 10 to the fluid reservoir 1010 to return the apparatus to a starting position. The implanted energy-transforming device 1002 transforms wireless energy into a current, for example a polarized current, for powering the motor/pump unit 1009 via an electric power supply line 1012. Instead of a hydraulically operated apparatus 10, it is also envisaged that the operation device comprises a pneumatic operation device. In this case, the hydraulic fluid can be pressurized air to be used for regulation and the fluid reservoir is replaced by an air chamber. In all of these embodiments the energy-transforming device 1002 may include a rechargeable accumulator like a battery or a capacitor to be charged by the wireless energy and supplies energy for any energy consuming part of the system. As an alternative, the wireless remote control described above may be replaced by manual control of any implanted part to make contact with by the patient's hand most likely indirect, for example a press button placed under the skin. FIG. 39 shows an embodiment of the invention comprising the external energy-transmission device 1004 with its wireless remote control, the apparatus 10, in this case hydraulically operated, and the implanted energy-transforming device 1002, and further comprising a hydraulic fluid reservoir 1013, a motor/pump unit 1009 and an reversing device in the form of a hydraulic valve shifting device 1014, all implanted in the patient. Of course the hydraulic operation could easily be performed by just changing the pumping direction and the hydraulic valve may therefor be omitted. The remote control may be a device separated from the external energy-transmission device or included in the same. The motor of the motor/pump unit 1009 is an electric motor. In response to a control signal from the wireless remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004, the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 powers the motor/pump unit 1009 with energy from the energy carried by the control signal, whereby the motor/pump unit 1009 distributes hydraulic fluid between the hydraulic fluid reservoir 1013 and the apparatus 10. The remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004 controls the hydraulic valve shifting device 1014 to shift the hydraulic fluid flow direction between one direction in which the fluid is pumped by the motor/pump unit 1009 from the hydraulic fluid reservoir 1013 to the apparatus 10 to operate the apparatus, and another opposite direction in which the fluid is pumped by the motor/pump unit 1009 back from the apparatus 10 to the hydraulic fluid reservoir 1013 to return the apparatus to a starting position. FIG. 40 shows an embodiment of the invention comprising the external energy-transmission device 1004 with its wireless remote control, the apparatus 10, the implanted energy-transforming device 1002, an implanted internal control unit 1015 controlled by the wireless remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004, an implanted accumulator 1016 and an implanted capacitor 1017. The internal control unit 1015 arranges storage of electric energy received from the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 in the accumulator 1016, which supplies energy to the apparatus 10. In response to a control signal from the wireless remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004, the internal control unit 1015 either releases electric energy from the accumulator 1016 and transfers the released energy via power lines 1018 and 1019, or directly transfers electric energy from the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 via a power line 1020, the capacitor 1017, which stabilizes the electric current, a power line 1021 and the power line 1019, for the operation of the apparatus 10. The internal control unit is preferably programmable from outside the patient's body. In a preferred embodiment, the internal control unit is programmed to regulate the apparatus 10 according to a pre-programmed time-schedule or to input from any sensor sensing any possible physical parameter of the patient or any functional parameter of the system. In accordance with an alternative, the capacitor 1017 in the embodiment of FIG. 40, 10 may be omitted. In accordance with another alternative, the accumulator 1016 in this embodiment may be omitted. FIG. 41 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 35, except that a battery 1022 for supplying energy for the operation of the apparatus 10 and an electric switch 1023 for switching the operation of the apparatus 10 also are implanted in the patient. The electric switch 1023 may be controlled by the remote control and may also be operated by the energy supplied by the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 to switch from an off mode, in which the battery 1022 is not in use, to an on mode, in which the battery 1022 supplies energy for the operation of the apparatus 10. FIG. 42 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 41, except that an internal control unit 1015 controllable by the wireless remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004 also is implanted in the patient. In this case, the electric switch 1023 is operated by the energy supplied by the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 to switch from an off mode, in which the wireless remote control is prevented from controlling the internal control unit 1015 and the battery is not in use, to a standby mode, in which the remote control is permitted to control the internal control unit 1015 to release electric energy from the battery 1022 for the operation of the apparatus 10. FIG. 43 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 42, except that an accumulator 1016 is substituted for the battery 1022 and the implanted components are interconnected differently. In this case, the accumulator 1016 stores energy from the implanted energy-transforming device 1002. In response to a control signal from the wireless remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004, the internal control unit 1015 controls the electric switch 1023 to switch from an off mode, in which the accumulator 1016 is not in use, to an on mode, in which the accumulator 1016 supplies energy for the operation of the apparatus 10. The accumulator may be combined with or replaced by a capacitor. FIG. 44 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 43, except that a battery 1022 also is implanted in the patient and the implanted components are interconnected differently. In response to a control signal from the wireless remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004, the internal control unit 1015 controls the accumulator 1016 to deliver energy for operating the electric switch 1023 to switch from an off mode, in which the battery 1022 is not in use, to an on mode, in which the battery 1022 supplies electric energy for the operation of the apparatus 10. Alternatively, the electric switch 1023 may be operated by energy supplied by the accumulator 1016 to switch from an off mode, in which the wireless remote control is prevented from controlling the battery 1022 to supply electric energy and is not in use, to a standby mode, in which the wireless remote control is permitted to control the battery 1022 to supply electric energy for the operation of the apparatus 10. It should be understood that the switch 1023 and all other switches in this application should be interpreted in its broadest embodiment. This means a transistor, MCU, MCPU, ASIC, FPGA or a DA converter or any other electronic component or circuit that may switch the power on and off. Preferably the switch is controlled from outside the body, or alternatively by an implanted internal control unit. FIG. 45 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 41, except that a motor 1007, a mechanical reversing device in the form of a gear box 1024, and an internal control unit 1015 for controlling the gear box 1024 also are implanted in the patient. The internal control unit 1015 controls the gear box 1024 to reverse the function performed by the apparatus 10 (mechanically operated). Even simpler is to switch the direction of the motor electronically. The gear box interpreted in its broadest embodiment may stand for a servo arrangement saving force for the operation device in favor of longer stroke to act. FIG. 46 shows an embodiment of the invention identical to that of FIG. 52 except that the implanted components are interconnected differently. Thus, in this case the internal control unit 1015 is powered by the battery 1022 when the accumulator 1016, suitably a capacitor, activates the electric switch 1023 to switch to an on mode. When the electric switch 1023 is in its on mode the internal control unit 1015 is permitted to control the battery 1022 to supply, or not supply, energy for the operation of the apparatus 10. FIG. 47 schematically shows conceivable combinations of implanted components of the apparatus for achieving various communication options. Basically, there are the apparatus 10, the internal control unit 1015, motor or pump unit 1009, and the external energy-transmission device 1004 including the external wireless remote control. As already described above the wireless remote control transmits a control signal which is received by the internal control unit 1015, which in turn controls the various implanted components of the apparatus. A feedback device, preferably comprising a sensor or measuring device 1025, may be implanted in the patient for sensing a physical parameter of the patient. The physical parameter may be at least one selected from the group consisting of pressure, volume, diameter, stretching, elongation, extension, movement, bending, elasticity, muscle contraction, nerve impulse, body temperature, blood pressure, blood flow, heartbeats and breathing. The sensor may sense any of the above physical parameters. For example, the sensor may be a pressure or motility sensor. Alternatively, the sensor 1025 may be arranged to sense a functional parameter. The functional parameter may be correlated to the transfer of energy for charging an implanted energy source and may further include at least one selected from the group of parameters consisting of; electricity, any electrical parameter, pressure, volume, diameter, stretch, elongation, extension, movement, bending, elasticity, temperature and flow. The feedback may be sent to the internal control unit or out to an external control unit preferably via the internal control unit. Feedback may be sent out from the body via the energy transfer system or a separate communication system with receiver and transmitters. The internal control unit 1015, or alternatively the external wireless remote control of the external energy-transmission device 1004, may control the apparatus 10 in response to signals from the sensor 1025. A transceiver may be combined with the sensor 1025 for sending information on the sensed physical parameter to the external wireless remote control. The wireless remote control may comprise a signal transmitter or transceiver and the internal control unit 1015 may comprise a signal receiver or transceiver. Alternatively, the wireless remote control may comprise a signal receiver or transceiver and the internal control unit 1015 may comprise a signal transmitter or transceiver. The above transceivers, transmitters and receivers may be used for sending information or data related to the apparatus 10 from inside the patient's body to the outside thereof. Where the motor/pump unit 1009 and battery 1022 for powering the motor/pump unit 1009 are implanted, information related to the charging of the battery 1022 may be fed back. To be more precise, when charging a battery or accumulator with energy feed back information related to said charging process is sent and the energy supply is changed accordingly. FIG. 48 shows an alternative embodiment wherein the apparatus 10 is regulated from outside the patient's body. The system 1000 comprises a battery 1022 connected to the apparatus 10 via a subcutaneous electric switch 1026. Thus, the regulation of the apparatus 10 is performed non-invasively by manually pressing the subcutaneous switch, whereby the operation of the apparatus 10 is switched on and off. It will be appreciated that the shown embodiment is a simplification and that additional components, such as an internal control unit or any other part disclosed in the present application can be added to the system. Two subcutaneous switches may also be used. In the preferred embodiment one implanted switch sends information to the internal control unit to perform a certain predetermined performance and when the patient press the switch again the performance is reversed. FIG. 49 shows an alternative embodiment, wherein the system 1000 comprises a hydraulic fluid reservoir 1013 hydraulically connected to the apparatus. Non-invasive regulation is performed by manually pressing the hydraulic reservoir connected to the apparatus. Alternatively, the hydraulic fluid reservoir 1013 is adapted to work with an injection port for the injection of hydraulic fluid, preferably for calibration of hydraulic fluid. The system may include an external data communicator and an implantable internal data communicator communicating with the external data communicator. The internal communicator feeds data related to the apparatus or the patient to the external data communicator and/or the external data communicator feeds data to the internal data communicator. FIG. 50 schematically illustrates an arrangement of the system that is capable of sending information from inside the patient's body to the outside thereof to give feedback information related to at least one functional parameter of the apparatus or system, or related to a physical parameter of the patient, in order to supply an accurate amount of energy to an implanted internal energy receiver 1002 connected to implanted energy consuming components of the apparatus 10. Such an energy receiver 1002 may include an energy source and/or an energy-transforming device. Briefly described, wireless energy is transmitted from an external energy source 1004a located outside the patient and is received by the internal energy receiver 1002 located inside the patient. The internal energy receiver is adapted to directly or indirectly supply received energy to the energy consuming components of the apparatus 10 via a switch 1026. An energy balance is determined between the energy received by the internal energy receiver 1002 and the energy used for the apparatus 10, and the transmission of wireless energy is then controlled based on the determined energy balance. The energy balance thus provides an accurate indication of the correct amount of energy needed, which is sufficient to operate the apparatus 10 properly, but without causing undue temperature rise. In FIG. 50 the patient's skin is indicated by a vertical line 1005. Here, the energy receiver comprises an energy-transforming device 1002 located inside the patient, preferably just beneath the patient's skin 1005. Generally speaking, the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 may be placed in the abdomen, thorax, muscle fascia (e.g. in the abdominal wall), subcutaneously, or at any other suitable location. The implanted energy-transforming device 1002 is adapted to receive wireless energy E transmitted from the external energy-source 1004a provided in an external energy-transmission device 1004 located outside the patient's skin 1005 in the vicinity of the implanted energy-transforming device 1002. As is well known in the art, the wireless energy E may generally be transferred by means of any suitable Transcutaneous Energy Transfer (TET) device, such as a device including a primary coil arranged in the external energy source 1004a and an adjacent secondary coil arranged in the implanted energy-transforming device 1002. When an electric current is fed through the primary coil, energy in the form of a voltage is induced in the secondary coil which can be used to power the implanted energy consuming components of the apparatus, e.g. after storing the incoming energy in an implanted energy source, such as a rechargeable battery or a capacitor. However, the present invention is generally not limited to any particular energy transfer technique, TET devices or energy sources, and any kind of wireless energy may be used. The amount of energy received by the implanted energy receiver may be compared with the energy used by the implanted components of the apparatus. The term “energy used” is then understood to include also energy stored by implanted components of the apparatus. A control device includes an external control unit 1004b that controls the external energy source 1004a based on the determined energy balance to regulate the amount of transferred energy. In order to transfer the correct amount of energy, the energy balance and the required amount of energy is determined by means of a determination device including an implanted internal control unit 1015 connected between the switch 1026 and the apparatus 10. The internal control unit 1015 may thus be arranged to receive various measurements obtained by suitable sensors or the like, not shown, measuring certain characteristics of the apparatus 10, somehow reflecting the required amount of energy needed for proper operation of the apparatus 10. Moreover, the current condition of the patient may also be detected by means of suitable measuring devices or sensors, in order to provide parameters reflecting the patient's condition. Hence, such characteristics and/or parameters may be related to the current state of the apparatus 10, such as power consumption, operational mode and temperature, as well as the patient's condition reflected by parameters such as; body temperature, blood pressure, heartbeats and breathing. Other kinds of physical parameters of the patient and functional parameters of the device are described elsewhere. Furthermore, an energy source in the form of an accumulator 1016 may optionally be connected to the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 via the control unit 1015 for accumulating received energy for later use by the apparatus 10. Alternatively or additionally, characteristics of such an accumulator, also reflecting the required amount of energy, may be measured as well. The accumulator may be replaced by a rechargeable battery, and the measured characteristics may be related to the current state of the battery, any electrical parameter such as energy consumption voltage, temperature, etc. In order to provide sufficient voltage and current to the apparatus 10, and also to avoid excessive heating, it is clearly understood that the battery should be charged optimally by receiving a correct amount of energy from the implanted energy-transforming device 1002, i.e. not too little or too much. The accumulator may also be a capacitor with corresponding characteristics. For example, battery characteristics may be measured on a regular basis to determine the current state of the battery, which then may be stored as state information in a suitable storage means in the internal control unit 1015. Thus, whenever new measurements are made, the stored battery state information can be updated accordingly. In this way, the state of the battery can be “calibrated” by transferring a correct amount of energy, so as to maintain the battery in an optimal condition. Thus, the internal control unit 1015 of the determination device is adapted to determine the energy balance and/or the currently required amount of energy, (either energy per time unit or accumulated energy) based on measurements made by the above-mentioned sensors or measuring devices of the apparatus 10, or the patient, or an implanted energy source if used, or any combination thereof. The internal control unit 1015 is further connected to an internal signal transmitter 1027, arranged to transmit a control signal reflecting the determined required amount of energy, to an external signal receiver 1004c connected to the external control unit 1004b. The amount of energy transmitted from the external energy source 1004a may then be regulated in response to the received control signal. Alternatively, the determination device may include the external control unit 1004b. In this alternative, sensor measurements can be transmitted directly to the external control unit 1004b wherein the energy balance and/or the currently required amount of energy can be determined by the external control unit 1004b, thus integrating the above-described function of the internal control unit 1015 in the external control unit 1004b. In that case, the internal control unit 1015 can be omitted and the sensor measurements are supplied directly to the internal signal transmitter 1027 which sends the measurements over to the external signal receiver 1004c and the external control unit 1004b. The energy balance and the currently required amount of energy can then be determined by the external control unit 1004b based on those sensor measurements. Hence, the present solution according to the arrangement of FIG. 50 employs the feed back of information indicating the required energy, which is more efficient than previous solutions because it is based on the actual use of energy that is compared to the received energy, e.g. with respect to the amount of energy, the energy difference, or the energy receiving rate as compared to the energy rate used by implanted energy consuming components of the apparatus. The apparatus may use the received energy either for consuming or for storing the energy in an implanted energy source or the like. The different parameters discussed above would thus be used if relevant and needed and then as a tool for determining the actual energy balance. However, such parameters may also be needed per se for any actions taken internally to specifically operate the apparatus. The internal signal transmitter 1027 and the external signal receiver 1004c may be implemented as separate units using suitable signal transfer means, such as radio, IR (Infrared) or ultrasonic signals. Alternatively, the internal signal transmitter 1027 and the external signal receiver 1004c may be integrated in the implanted energy-transforming device 1002 and the external energy source 1004a, respectively, so as to convey control signals in a reverse direction relative to the energy transfer, basically using the same transmission technique. The control signals may be modulated with respect to frequency, phase or amplitude. Thus, the feedback information may be transferred either by a separate communication system including receivers and transmitters or may be integrated in the energy system. In accordance with the present invention, such an integrated information feedback and energy system comprises an implantable internal energy receiver for receiving wireless energy, the energy receiver having an internal first coil and a first electronic circuit connected to the first coil, and an external energy transmitter for transmitting wireless energy, the energy transmitter having an external second coil and a second electronic circuit connected to the second coil. The external second coil of the energy transmitter transmits wireless energy which is received by the first coil of the energy receiver. This system further comprises a power switch for switching the connection of the internal first coil to the first electronic circuit on and off, such that feedback information related to the charging of the first coil is received by the external energy transmitter in the form of an impedance variation in the load of the external second coil, when the power switch switches the connection of the internal first coil to the first electronic circuit on and off. In implementing this system in the arrangement of FIG. 50, the switch 1026 is either separate and controlled by the internal control unit 1015, or integrated in the internal control unit 1015. It should be understood that the switch 1026 should be interpreted in its broadest embodiment. This means a transistor, MCU, MCPU, ASIC FPGA or a DA converter or any other electronic component or circuit that may switch the power on and off. To conclude, the energy supply arrangement illustrated in FIG. 50 may operate basically in the following manner. The energy balance is first determined by the internal control unit 1015 of the determination device. A control signal reflecting the required amount of energy is also created by the internal control unit 1015, and the control signal is transmitted from the internal signal transmitter 1027 to the external signal receiver 1004c. Alternatively, the energy balance can be determined by the external control unit 1004b instead depending on the implementation, as mentioned above. In that case, the control signal may carry measurement results from various sensors. The amount of energy emitted from the external energy source 1004a can then be regulated by the external control unit 1004b, based on the determined energy balance, e.g. in response to the received control signal. This process may be repeated intermittently at certain intervals during ongoing energy transfer, or may be executed on a more or less continuous basis during the energy transfer. The amount of transferred energy can generally be regulated by adjusting various transmission parameters in the external energy source 1004a, such as voltage, current, amplitude, wave frequency and pulse characteristics. This system may also be used to obtain information about the coupling factors between the coils in a TET system even to calibrate the system both to find an optimal place for the external coil in relation to the internal coil and to optimize energy transfer. Simply comparing in this case the amount of energy transferred with the amount of energy received. For example if the external coil is moved the coupling factor may vary and correctly displayed movements could cause the external coil to find the optimal place for energy transfer. Preferably, the external coil is adapted to calibrate the amount of transferred energy to achieve the feedback information in the determination device, before the coupling factor is maximized. This coupling factor information may also be used as a feedback during energy transfer. In such a case, the energy system of the present invention comprises an implantable internal energy receiver for receiving wireless energy, the energy receiver having an internal first coil and a first electronic circuit connected to the first coil, and an external energy transmitter for transmitting wireless energy, the energy transmitter having an external second coil and a second electronic circuit connected to the second coil. The external second coil of the energy transmitter transmits wireless energy which is received by the first coil of the energy receiver. This system further comprises a feedback device for communicating out the amount of energy received in the first coil as a feedback information, and wherein the second electronic circuit includes a determination device for receiving the feedback information and for comparing the amount of transferred energy by the second coil with the feedback information related to the amount of energy received in the first coil to obtain the coupling factor between the first and second coils. The energy transmitter may regulate the transmitted energy in response to the obtained coupling factor. With reference to FIG. 51, although wireless transfer of energy for operating the apparatus has been described above to enable non-invasive operation, it will be appreciated that the apparatus can be operated with wire bound energy as well. Such an example is shown in FIG. 51, wherein an external switch 1026 is interconnected between the external energy source 1004a and an operation device, such as an electric motor 1007 operating the apparatus 10. An external control unit 1004b controls the operation of the external switch 1026 to effect proper operation of the apparatus 10. FIG. 52 illustrates different embodiments for how received energy can be supplied to and used by the apparatus 10. Similar to the example of FIG. 50, an internal energy receiver 1002 receives wireless energy E from an external energy source 1004a which is controlled by a transmission control unit 1004b. The internal energy receiver 1002 may comprise a constant voltage circuit, indicated as a dashed box “constant V” in the figure, for supplying energy at constant voltage to the apparatus 10. The internal energy receiver 1002 may further comprise a constant current circuit, indicated as a dashed box “constant C” in the figure, for supplying energy at constant current to the apparatus 10. The apparatus 10 comprises an energy consuming part 10a, which may be a motor, pump, restriction device, or any other medical appliance that requires energy for its electrical operation. The apparatus 10 may further comprise an energy storage device 10b for storing energy supplied from the internal energy receiver 1002. Thus, the supplied energy may be directly consumed by the energy consuming part 10a, or stored by the energy storage device 10b, or the supplied energy may be partly consumed and partly stored. The apparatus 10 may further comprise an energy stabilizing unit 10c for stabilizing the energy supplied from the internal energy receiver 1002. Thus, the energy may be supplied in a fluctuating manner such that it may be necessary to stabilize the energy before consumed or stored. The energy supplied from the internal energy receiver 1002 may further be accumulated and/or stabilized by a separate energy stabilizing unit 1028 located outside the apparatus 10, before being consumed and/or stored by the apparatus 10. Alternatively, the energy stabilizing unit 1028 may be integrated in the internal energy receiver 1002. In either case, the energy stabilizing unit 1028 may comprise a constant voltage circuit and/or a constant current circuit. It should be noted that FIG. 50 and FIG. 52 illustrate some possible but non-limiting implementation options regarding how the various shown functional components and elements can be arranged and connected to each other. However, the skilled person will readily appreciate that many variations and modifications can be made within the scope of the present invention. FIG. 53 schematically shows an energy balance measuring circuit of one of the proposed designs of the system for controlling transmission of wireless energy, or energy balance control system. The circuit has an output signal centered on 2.5V and proportionally related to the energy imbalance. The derivative of this signal shows if the value goes up and down and how fast such a change takes place. If the amount of received energy is lower than the energy used by implanted components of the apparatus, more energy is transferred and thus charged into the energy source. The output signal from the circuit is typically feed to an A/D converter and converted into a digital format. The digital information can then be sent to the external energy-transmission device allowing it to adjust the level of the transmitted energy. Another possibility is to have a completely analog system that uses comparators comparing the energy balance level with certain maximum and minimum thresholds sending information to external energy-transmission device if the balance drifts out of the max/min window. The schematic FIG. 53 shows a circuit implementation for a system that transfers energy to the implanted energy components of the apparatus of the present invention from outside of the patient's body using inductive energy transfer. An inductive energy transfer system typically uses an external transmitting coil and an internal receiving coil. The receiving coil, L1, is included in the schematic FIG. 36; the transmitting parts of the system are excluded. The implementation of the general concept of energy balance and the way the information is transmitted to the external energy transmitter can of course be implemented in numerous different ways. The schematic FIG. 53 and the above described method of evaluating and transmitting the information should only be regarded as examples of how to implement the control system. Circuit Details In FIG. 53 the symbols Y1, Y2, Y3 and so on symbolize test points within the circuit. The components in the diagram and their respective values are values that work in this particular implementation which of course is only one of an infinite number of possible design solutions. Energy to power the circuit is received by the energy receiving coil L1. Energy to implanted components is transmitted in this particular case at a frequency of 25 kHz. The energy balance output signal is present at test point Y1. Those skilled in the art will realize that the above various embodiments of the system could be combined in many different ways. For example, the electric switch 1006 of FIG. 36 could be incorporated in any of the embodiments of FIGS. 39-45, the hydraulic valve shifting device 1014 of FIG. 39 could be incorporated in the embodiment of FIG. 38, and the gear box 1024 could be incorporated in the embodiment of FIG. 37. Please observe that the switch simply could mean any electronic circuit or component. The embodiments described in connection with FIGS. 50, 52 and 53 identify a method and a system for controlling transmission of wireless energy to implanted energy consuming components of an electrically operable apparatus. Such a method and system will be defined in general terms in the following. A method is thus provided for controlling transmission of wireless energy supplied to implanted energy consuming components of an apparatus as described above. The wireless energy E is transmitted from an external energy source located outside the patient and is received by an internal energy receiver located inside the patient, the internal energy receiver being connected to the implanted energy consuming components of the apparatus for directly or indirectly supplying received energy thereto. An energy balance is determined between the energy received by the internal energy receiver and the energy used for the apparatus. The transmission of wireless energy E from the external energy source is then controlled based on the determined energy balance. The wireless energy may be transmitted inductively from a primary coil in the external energy source to a secondary coil in the internal energy receiver. A change in the energy balance may be detected to control the transmission of wireless energy based on the detected energy balance change. A difference may also be detected between energy received by the internal energy receiver and energy used for the medical device, to control the transmission of wireless energy based on the detected energy difference. When controlling the energy transmission, the amount of transmitted wireless energy may be decreased if the detected energy balance change implies that the energy balance is increasing, or vice versa. The decrease/increase of energy transmission may further correspond to a detected change rate. The amount of transmitted wireless energy may further be decreased if the detected energy difference implies that the received energy is greater than the used energy, or vice versa. The decrease/increase of energy transmission may then correspond to the magnitude of the detected energy difference. As mentioned above, the energy used for the medical device may be consumed to operate the medical device, and/or stored in at least one energy storage device of the medical device. When electrical and/or physical parameters of the medical device and/or physical parameters of the patient are determined, the energy may be transmitted for consumption and storage according to a transmission rate per time unit which is determined based on said parameters. The total amount of transmitted energy may also be determined based on said parameters. When a difference is detected between the total amount of energy received by the internal energy receiver and the total amount of consumed and/or stored energy, and the detected difference is related to the integral over time of at least one measured electrical parameter related to said energy balance, the integral may be determined for a monitored voltage and/or current related to the energy balance. When the derivative is determined over time of a measured electrical parameter related to the amount of consumed and/or stored energy, the derivative may be determined for a monitored voltage and/or current related to the energy balance. The transmission of wireless energy from the external energy source may be controlled by applying to the external energy source electrical pulses from a first electric circuit to transmit the wireless energy, the electrical pulses having leading and trailing edges, varying the lengths of first time intervals between successive leading and trailing edges of the electrical pulses and/or the lengths of second time intervals between successive trailing and leading edges of the electrical pulses, and transmitting wireless energy, the transmitted energy generated from the electrical pulses having a varied power, the varying of the power depending on the lengths of the first and/or second time intervals. In that case, the frequency of the electrical pulses may be substantially constant when varying the first and/or second time intervals. When applying electrical pulses, the electrical pulses may remain unchanged, except for varying the first and/or second time intervals. The amplitude of the electrical pulses may be substantially constant when varying the first and/or second time intervals. Further, the electrical pulses may be varied by only varying the lengths of first time intervals between successive leading and trailing edges of the electrical pulses. A train of two or more electrical pulses may be supplied in a row, wherein when applying the train of pulses, the train having a first electrical pulse at the start of the pulse train and having a second electrical pulse at the end of the pulse train, two or more pulse trains may be supplied in a row, wherein the lengths of the second time intervals between successive trailing edge of the second electrical pulse in a first pulse train and leading edge of the first electrical pulse of a second pulse train are varied. When applying the electrical pulses, the electrical pulses may have a substantially constant current and a substantially constant voltage. The electrical pulses may also have a substantially constant current and a substantially constant voltage. Further, the electrical pulses may also have a substantially constant frequency. The electrical pulses within a pulse train may likewise have a substantially constant frequency. The circuit formed by the first electric circuit and the external energy source may have a first characteristic time period or first time constant, and when effectively varying the transmitted energy, such frequency time period may be in the range of the first characteristic time period or time constant or shorter. A system comprising an apparatus as described above is thus also provided for controlling transmission of wireless energy supplied to implanted energy consuming components of the apparatus. In its broadest sense, the system comprises a control device for controlling the transmission of wireless energy from an energy-transmission device, and an implantable internal energy receiver for receiving the transmitted wireless energy, the internal energy receiver being connected to implantable energy consuming components of the apparatus for directly or indirectly supplying received energy thereto. The system further comprises a determination device adapted to determine an energy balance between the energy received by the internal energy receiver and the energy used for the implantable energy consuming components of the apparatus, wherein the control device controls the transmission of wireless energy from the external energy-transmission device, based on the energy balance determined by the determination device. In one embodiment at least one battery may be a part of or replace the energy-transforming device 1002 to supply energy to the apparatus 10 over a power supply line. In one embodiment the battery is not rechargeable. In an alternative embodiment the battery is rechargeable. The battery supply may of course be placed both remote to and incorporated in the device. Further, the system may comprise any of the following: A primary coil in the external energy source adapted to transmit the wireless energy inductively to a secondary coil in the internal energy receiver.The determination device is adapted to detect a change in the energy balance, and the control device controls the transmission of wireless energy based on the detected energy balance changeThe determination device is adapted to detect a difference between energy received by the internal energy receiver and energy used for the implantable energy consuming components of the apparatus, and the control device controls the transmission of wireless energy based on the detected energy difference.The control device controls the external energy-transmission device to decrease the amount of transmitted wireless energy if the detected energy balance change implies that the energy balance is increasing, or vice versa, wherein the decrease/increase of energy transmission corresponds to a detected change rate.The control device controls the external energy-transmission device to decrease the amount of transmitted wireless energy if the detected energy difference implies that the received energy is greater than the used energy, or vice versa, wherein the decrease/increase of energy transmission corresponds to the magnitude of said detected energy difference.The energy used for the apparatus is consumed to operate the apparatus, and/or stored in at least one energy storage device of the apparatus.Where electrical and/or physical parameters of the apparatus and/or physical parameters of the patient are determined, the energy-transmission device transmits the energy for consumption and storage according to a transmission rate per time unit which is determined by the determination device based on said parameters. The determination device also determines the total amount of transmitted energy based on said parameters.When a difference is detected between the total amount of energy received by the internal energy receiver and the total amount of consumed and/or stored energy, and the detected difference is related to the integral over time of at least one measured electrical parameter related to the energy balance, the determination device determines the integral for a monitored voltage and/or current related to the energy balance.When the derivative is determined over time of a measured electrical parameter related to the amount of consumed and/or stored energy, the determination device determines the derivative for a monitored voltage and/or current related to the energy balance.The energy-transmission device comprises a coil placed externally to the human body, and an electric circuit is provided to power the external coil with electrical pulses to transmit the wireless energy. The electrical pulses have leading and trailing edges, and the electric circuit is adapted to vary first time intervals between successive leading and trailing edges and/or second time intervals between successive trailing and leading edges of the electrical pulses to vary the power of the transmitted wireless energy. As a result, the energy receiver receiving the transmitted wireless energy has a varied power.The electric circuit is adapted to deliver the electrical pulses to remain unchanged except varying the first and/or second time intervals.The electric circuit has a time constant and is adapted to vary the first and second time intervals only in the range of the first time constant, so that when the lengths of the first and/or second time intervals are varied, the transmitted power over the coil is varied.The electric circuit is adapted to deliver the electrical pulses to be varied by only varying the lengths of first time intervals between successive leading and trailing edges of the electrical pulses.The electric circuit is adapted to supplying a train of two or more electrical pulses in a row, said train having a first electrical pulse at the start of the pulse train and having a second electrical pulse at the end of the pulse train, andthe lengths of the second time intervals between successive trailing edge of the second electrical pulse in a first pulse train and leading edge of the first electrical pulse of a second pulse train are varied by the first electronic circuit.The electric circuit is adapted to provide the electrical pulses as pulses having a substantially constant height and/or amplitude and/or intensity and/or voltage and/or current and/or frequency.The electric circuit has a time constant, and is adapted to vary the first and second time intervals only in the range of the first time constant, so that when the lengths of the first and/or second time intervals are varied, the transmitted power over the first coil are varied.The electric circuit is adapted to provide the electrical pulses varying the lengths of the first and/or the second time intervals only within a range that includes the first time constant or that is located relatively close to the first time constant, compared to the magnitude of the first time constant. FIGS. 54-57 show in more detail block diagrams of four different ways of hydraulically or pneumatically powering an implanted apparatus according to the invention. FIG. 54 shows a system as described above with. The system comprises an implanted apparatus 10 and further a separate regulation reservoir 1013, a one way pump 1009 and an alternate valve 1014. FIG. 55 shows the apparatus 10 and a fluid reservoir 1013. By moving the wall of the regulation reservoir or changing the size of the same in any other different way, the adjustment of the apparatus may be performed without any valve, just free passage of fluid any time by moving the reservoir wall. FIG. 56 shows the apparatus 10, a two way pump 1009 and the regulation reservoir 1013. FIG. 57 shows a block diagram of a reversed servo system with a first closed system controlling a second closed system. The servo system comprises a regulation reservoir 1013 and a servo reservoir 1050. The servo reservoir 1050 mechanically controls an implanted apparatus 10 via a mechanical interconnection 1054. The apparatus has an expandable/contactable cavity. This cavity is preferably expanded or contracted by supplying hydraulic fluid from the larger adjustable reservoir 1052 in fluid connection with the apparatus 10. Alternatively, the cavity contains compressible gas, which can be compressed and expanded under the control of the servo reservoir 1050. The servo reservoir 1050 can also be part of the apparatus itself. In one embodiment, the regulation reservoir is placed subcutaneous under the patient's skin and is operated by pushing the outer surface thereof by means of a finger. This system is illustrated in FIGS. 58a-c. In FIG. 58a, a flexible subcutaneous regulation reservoir 1013 is shown connected to a bulge shaped servo reservoir 1050 by means of a conduit 1011. This bellow shaped servo reservoir 1050 is comprised in a flexible apparatus 10. In the state shown in FIG. 58a, the servo reservoir 1050 contains a minimum of fluid and most fluid is found in the regulation reservoir 1013. Due to the mechanical interconnection between the servo reservoir 1050 and the apparatus 10, the outer shape of the apparatus 10 is contracted, i.e., it occupies less than its maximum volume. This maximum volume is shown with dashed lines in the figure. FIG. 58 b shows a state wherein a user, such as the patient in with the apparatus is implanted, presses the regulation reservoir 1013 so that fluid contained therein is brought to flow through the conduit 1011 and into the servo reservoir 1050, which, thanks to its bellow shape, expands longitudinally. This expansion in turn expands the apparatus 10 so that it occupies its maximum volume, thereby stretching the stomach wall (not shown), which it contacts. The regulation reservoir 1013 is preferably provided with means 1013a for keeping its shape after compression. This means, which is schematically shown in the figure, will thus keep the apparatus 10 in a stretched position also when the user releases the regulation reservoir. In this way, the regulation reservoir essentially operates as an on/off switch for the system. An alternative embodiment of hydraulic or pneumatic operation will now be described with reference to FIGS. 59 and 60a-c. The block diagram shown in FIG. 59 comprises with a first closed system controlling a second closed system. The first system comprises a regulation reservoir 1013 and a servo reservoir 1050. The servo reservoir 1050 mechanically controls a larger adjustable reservoir 1052 via a mechanical interconnection 1054. An implanted apparatus 10 having an expandable/contactable cavity is in turn controlled by the larger adjustable reservoir 1052 by supply of hydraulic fluid from the larger adjustable reservoir 1052 in fluid connection with the apparatus 10. An example of this embodiment will now be described with reference to FIG. 60a-c. Like in the previous embodiment, the regulation reservoir is placed subcutaneous under the patient's skin and is operated by pushing the outer surface thereof by means of a finger. The regulation reservoir 1013 is in fluid connection with a bellow shaped servo reservoir 1050 by means of a conduit 1011. In the first closed system 1013, 1011, 1050 shown in FIG. 60a, the servo reservoir 1050 contains a minimum of fluid and most fluid is found in the regulation reservoir 1013. The servo reservoir 1050 is mechanically connected to a larger adjustable reservoir 1052, in this example also having a bellow shape but with a larger diameter than the servo reservoir 1050. The larger adjustable reservoir 1052 is in fluid connection with the apparatus 10. This means that when a user pushes the regulation reservoir 1013, thereby displacing fluid from the regulation reservoir 1013 to the servo reservoir 1050, the expansion of the servo reservoir 1050 will displace a larger volume of fluid from the larger adjustable reservoir 1052 to the apparatus 10. In other words, in this reversed servo, a small volume in the regulation reservoir is compressed with a higher force and this creates a movement of a larger total area with less force per area unit. Like in the previous embodiment described above with reference to FIGS. 58a-c, the regulation reservoir 1013 is preferably provided with means 1013a for keeping its shape after compression. This means, which is schematically shown in the figure, will thus keep the apparatus 10 in a stretched position also when the user releases the regulation reservoir. In this way, the regulation reservoir essentially operates as an on/off switch for the system. Although the different parts described above have specific placements on the drawings it should be understood that these placements might vary, depending on the application. The lubricating fluid used in any of the embodiments herein is preferably a biocompatible lubricating fluid imitating the synovial fluid of the natural hip joint. According to one embodiment the lubricating fluid is Hyaluronic acid. In all of the embodiments above it is conceivable that the conduit is excluded and that the channel or channels are in direct connection with the reservoir or the injection port.

All examples herein should be seen as part of the general description and therefor possible to combine in any way in general terms.
