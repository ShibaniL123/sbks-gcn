Example 19: Synthesis of 5-(4-(1-(4-(hydroxyamino)-3-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-4-oxobutyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)phenyl)pent-4-yn-1-yl methanesulfonate
Step 1: Synthesis of methyl 2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(4-(4-(5-((methylsulfonyl)oxy)pent-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)butanoate
To a solution of methyl 4-(4-(4-(5-hydroxypent-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate (1.5 g, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (17.3 ml) was added with Et3N (0.964 ml, 2 eq) and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.793 ml, 2 eq). The mixture was stirred for 2 hr at room temperature and extracted with dichloromethane and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (0.9 g, 51%).
