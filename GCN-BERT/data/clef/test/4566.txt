PUSH AND PULL MEDICAL DEVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM BACKGROUND Field [0001] The present disclosure relates to delivery systems for implantable medical devices and, more particularly, relates to delivery systems for endoluminal delivery and push-pull positioning of implantable medical devices utilizing multiple percutaneous access points. Discussion of the Related Art [0002] The use of implantable medical devices in the treatment of diseased vasculature and other body conduits has become commonplace in the medical field. Such devices can be surgically implanted in or delivered endoluminally to the treatment site. In the latter case, these devices are typically retained in a compacted crown diameter along a leading end of a catheter for insertion through a percutaneous access site. It can be desirable for the catheter to have sufficient rigidity to enable a clinician to push the catheter through the single access point and traverses the vasculature without bunching or buckling and further allow axial or rotational control while positioning the device at the treatment site. On the other hand, it is at times desirable for the catheter to have sufficient flexibility to traverse tortuous vasculature. In some cases, multiple access sites and/or multiple catheters can be used to deliver multiple devices and/or related tools to the treatment site. Multiple access sites and catheters may help the healthcare provider to accomplish more complicated procedures, but current multiple access site delivery schemes still have some weaknesses in delivering medical devices accurately. [0003] Multiple percutaneous access sites may be useful in the aorta wherein one access is radial or brachial and the other is iliac or femoral. In the peripheral anatomy, a clinician may use a pedal access along with iliac or femoral to place a device such as stent, stent-graft or use and control endovascular tools such as embolectomy, CTO, Thrombectomy or atherectomy tools. Other potential access sites include translumbar access to the aorta, transapical access in the heart to radial, brachial or femoral, femoral to femoral over the aortic bifurcation, any venous access, crossing the atrial septum and continuing on to any appropriate arterial access site. As has become obvious, any multiple access sites may be envisioned which, when traversed by an endoluminal tool, can provide a clinician enhanced peri- procedural control of endoluminal tools and devices. Likewise, the access and egress should not be limited to the vascular system. These same benefits apply to other bodily systems such as gastrointestinal, colo-rectal, esophageal and biliary. It is also envisioned there is benefit in procedures such as bypass grafting wherein the tools and devices actually leave the host lumen path and establish an alternate route and even wherein there is no host vessel at all, such as in placement of indwelling electrical leads for neurostimulation or similar. [0004] Therefore, it remains desirable to provide a multiple access site delivery system that facilitates accurate and efficient endoluminal deployment of implantable devices and endovascular tools.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0024] Persons skilled in the art will readily appreciate that various aspects of the present disclosure can be realized by any number of methods and apparatuses configured to perform the intended functions. Stated differently, other methods and apparatuses can be incorporated herein to perform the intended functions. It should also be noted that the accompanying drawing figures referred to herein are not all drawn to scale, but can be exaggerated to illustrate various aspects of the present disclosure, and in that regard, the drawing figures should not be construed as limiting. Finally, although the present disclosure can be described in connection with various principles and beliefs, the present disclosure should not be bound by theory. [0025] Throughout this specification and in the claims, the term "distal" refers to a location that is, or a portion of an endoluminal device (such as a stent-graft) that when implanted is, further downstream with respect to blood flow than another portion of the device. Similarly, the term "distally" refers to the direction of blood flow or further downstream in the direction of blood flow. [0026] The term "proximal" refers to a location that is, or a portion of an endoluminal device that when implanted is, further upstream with respect to blood flow than another portion of the device. Similarly, the term "proximally" refers to the direction opposite to the direction of blood flow or upstream from the direction of blood flow. [0027] With further regard to the terms proximal and distal, and because the present disclosure is not limited to peripheral and/or central approaches, this disclosure should not be narrowly construed with respect to these terms. Rather, the devices and methods described herein can be altered and/or adjusted relative to the anatomy of a patient. [0028] Throughout this specification and in the claims, the term "leading" refers to a relative location on a device which is closer to the end of the device that is inserted into and progressed through the vasculature of a patient. The term "trailing" refers to a relative location on a device which is closer to the end of the device that is located outside of the vasculature of a patient. [0029] Delivery systems for deployment of expandable devices or implants are disclosed herein which utilize multiple percutaneous access sites for treating a variety of vascular diseases, as shown in FIG. 1 , for example, for treating aneurysms 10 along a vessel 100, Although illustrated in the context of deploying a stent graft for treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), it should be appreciated that the devices, systems and methods described herein are not limited to treatment of AAA's and can be applied to delivery of any endoluminally deliverable device, component or tool for treatment of disease in other parts of human vasculature. Examples of stent grafts usable with delivery systems in accordance with the present disclosure are disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,042,605 to Martin et. al. [0030] Referring to FIGS. 2, 3A, 3B and 3C, a delivery system is shown in a configuration utilizingjwo or more percutaneous access sites 102, 104. In this configuration, the delivery system allows push-pull positioning and delivery of an expandable device at a vascular treatment site through manipulation of at least two portions or members of the delivery system from outside of the body from respective access sites. The delivery system can include first and second introducer sheaths 202, 204 to facilitate introduction of surgical implements through respective access sites 102, 1 04. The delivery system includes a guidewire 206 that can be routed through a portion of vasculature to be treated in a "body floss" or "through-and- through" access configuration, wherein opposite terminal ends 205, 207 of the guidewire 206 extend outside of the body from respective percutaneous access sites 102, 104 via the first and second introducer sheaths 202, 204. [0031] A delivery system for endoluminal delivery of an implantable medical device can include elongated first and second catheters extending through respective first and second percutaneous access points and releasably coupled to each other at leading ends thereof to allow a push-pull or a pull-pull positioning of the implantable medical device prior to full deployment at the treatment site. For example, as shown in FIG. 3A, a first catheter, generally indicated at 300, includes a leading end 306 and an opposite trailing end 322. The first catheter 300 has a guidewire lumen 310 through which a guidewire 206 can be routed. A first end 205 of the guidewire 206 can be inserted into the guidewire lumen 31 0 at the leading end 306 of the first catheter 300. The leading end 306 of the first catheter 300 can be fed into the vasculature through the first access site 102 via the first introducer sheath 202. The first catheter 300 can then be pushed along the guidewire 206 in the direction indicated at 302 until the leading end 306 exits the second access site 104. The trailing end 322 of the first catheter 300 remains outside of the body and extends from the first access site 1 02 via the first introducer sheath 202. In this configuration, the catheter 300 can be maneuvered by pushing or pulling the leading end 306 and trailing ends 322 of the first catheter 300 from outside of the body. [0032] Alternatively, the catheter 300 can be inserted through the second access site 104 via the second introducer sheath 204, translated in a retrograde direction opposite the direction indicated at 302, and out of the first access site 102. In either case, transfer of the leading end 306 between the first access site 102 and second access site 104 can be facilitated with a snare. This can be helpful if the catheter has a low bending or column strength such that it can not be effectively navigated between access sites by only pushing on one end of the catheter from outside the body. [0033] Still referring to FIG. 3A, a second catheter, generally indicated at 400, includes a leading end 406 and an opposite trailing end 422. The second catheter 400 has a guidewire lumen 410 for receiving the guidewire 206 therethrough. The second end 207 of the guidewire 206 can be inserted into the guidewire lumen 410 at the leading end 406 of the second catheter 400. The second catheter 400 can be pushed along the guidewire 206 until the leading ends 306, 406 engage. [0034] An expandable device can be releasably coupled to one of the first and second catheters at or near the leading end thereof. The expandable device can be releasably maintained or radially compressed toward a delivery configuration for endoluminal delivery by any suitable constraining means, such as a film constraining sleeve, a constraining tether or lattice, retractable sheath and the like. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3A, an expandable device 500 is disposed at or near the leading end 406 of the second catheter 400. The expandable device 500 is compressed and held toward the delivery configuration by a constraining sleeve 502 extending about the expandable device 500 and having opposite ends or portions held together by a release line 504. The release line 504 can be disengaged from the constraining sleeve 502 to allow the device 500 to expand radially outwardly toward an unconstrained state or a partially unconstrained state or otherwise toward engagement with surrounding vessel walls at the treatment site. Optionally, one or more constraining means or combination of constraining means can be configured to allow staged expansion through one or more intermediate expanded states prior to full deployment. An example of means for releasably constraining a device for endoluminal delivery is provided in U.S. Patent 6,352,561 to Leopold et al. [0035] The leading ends 306, 406 of the first and second catheters 300, 400 can be configured for matingly engaging or coupling to each other. Further, the leading ends 306, 406 can be configured for releasably coupling to each other. Coupling of the leading ends can be achieved by a variety of coupling arrangements. Non-limiting examples of coupling arrangements can include press fitting, threads, ball and detent, articulating clips or jaws, hook and loop, and magnetic. The leading ends 306, 406 of the first and second catheters 300, 400 can be coupled to each other extracorporeal, as shown in FIG. 3A. Alternatively, the first and second catheters 300, 400 can be inserted into respective first and second access sites 102, 104 and the leading ends 306, 406 can be coupled in situ at or around the treatment site, as shown in FIG. 3B. [0036] Once the leading ends 306, 406 are coupled, trailing ends 322, 422 of the first and second catheters 300, 400 outside of the body can be pushed, pulled and rotated to axially and rotatably position the expandable device 500 at the treatment site. After the expandable device 500 has been positioned at a desirable location and orientation at the treatment site, the expandable device 500 can be fully deployed to engage the surrounding vessel walls at the treatment site, as shown in FIG. 8. [0037] Leading ends of first and second catheters can be coupled by providing an expandable device in a delivery configuration on a leading end of one of the first and second catheters and partially deploying the expandable device toward releasable engagement with a leading end of the other of the first and second catheters. The implantable prosthesis can be at least partially constrained along an outer wall of one of the first and second catheters and at least partially constrained along an inner wall of one of the first and second catheters, thereby forming a releasable connection between the first and second catheters. As shown in FIG. 4, for example, an expandable device 500 is disposed at or near the leading end 406 of the second catheter 400. More specifically, at least a portion of the expandable device 500 extends along an outer surface 428 of the second catheter 400 at or near the leading end 406 of the second catheter 400. The expandable device 500 is compressed and held toward the delivery configuration by a constraining sleeve 502 held together by a release line 504. The release line 504 can be disengaged from the constraining sleeve 502 to allow at least a portion of the device 500 to expand radially outwardly toward engagement with the leading end 306 of the first catheter 300. In a number of embodiments, the leading end 306 of the first catheter 300 can include a bore 360 defined by an inner surface 362. The inner surface 362 can be generally annular for receiving therein the leading end 406 of the second catheter 400 and the constrained expandable device 500 supported thereon. [0038] Referring to FIG. 5, disengagement of the release line 504 from the constraining sleeve 502 allows at least a portion of the device 500 to expand radially outwardly toward engagement with the inner surface 362 at the leading end 306 of the first catheter 300. A partially expanded portion 506 of the expandable device 500 has an engagement length measured by the length of the partially expanded portion 506 engaged with the inner surface 362 to create a releasable interconnection between the first and second catheters 300, 400. A remaining constrained portion 508 of the expandable device 500 may at least partially extend in the leading end 306 of the first catheter 300. The partially expanded portion 506 should apply sufficient outward radial force against the inner surface 362 to form a frictional coupling between the first and second catheters 300, 400 that allows, in one configuration, the first and second catheters 300, 400 to be pushed and/or pulled and/or rotated to axially and/or rotatably position the expandable device 500 at the treatment site. In another configuration, the coupling formed by the engagement between the partially expanded portion 506 and the inner surface 362 is releasable to allow decoupling and separation of the first and second catheters 300, 400. [0039] An opened section of the constraining sleeve 502 along the partially expanded portion 506 can be configured to remain between the first catheter inner wall and the expandable device 500. Alternatively, the constraining sleeve or portions thereof can be configured to be completely removed after deployment of the expandable device at the treatment site. [0040] Optionally, the inner surface 362 can be configured to enhance the engagement or coupling between the first catheter 300 and second catheter 400. For example, the inner surface 362 can include a texture or a rubber-like coating or layer to increase friction between the expandable device and the inner surface. Alternatively, the inner surface 362 can have cross-sectional profile that corresponds with or otherwise forms an interference engagement with an outer profile of the expandable device 500. [0041] Once the leading ends 306, 406 are coupled, trailing ends 322, 422 of the first and second catheters 300, 400 outside of the body can be pushed, pulled and rotated to axially and rotatably position the expandable device 500 at the treatment site. After the expandable device 500 has been positioned at a desirable location and orientation at the treatment site, the expandable device 500 can be fully deployed to engage the surrounding vessel walls at the treatment site, as shown in FIG. 8. [0042] In one deployment mode, the constraining sleeve 502 can be opened by displacing the release line 504 from the constraining sleeve 502 to allow the remaining constrained portion 508 to expand toward engagement with surrounding vessel walls on a first side 91 of an aneurysm 10 at the treatment side, as shown in FIG. 7A. With the expandable device 500 still releasably coupled to the second catheter 400 and/or with the device 500 engaged with engaged or anchored with the vessel walls, the first catheter 300 can be displaced proximally or away from the second catheter 400, as indicated at arrow 602, to overcome the frictional engagement between the expandable device 500 and the inner surface 362. The displacement of the first catheter 300 away from the second catheter 400 allows the partially expanded portion 506 of the expandable device 500 to expand toward engagement with surrounding vessel walls on a second side 92 of the aneurysm 10, thereby completing exclusion of the aneurysm 10 from normal blood flow through the vessel, as shown in FIG. 8. [0043] In an alternate deployment mode, the first catheter 300 can be displaced proximally or away from the second catheter 400, as indicated at arrow 602, to overcome the releasable connection between the first and second catheters 300, 400 due to the frictional engagement between the expandable device 500 and the inner surface 362. The displacement of the first catheter 300 away from the second catheter 400 allows the partially expanded portion 506 of the expandable device 500 to expand toward engagement with surrounding vessel walls on the second side a2 of the aneurysm 10, as shown in FIG. 7B. The remaining constrained portion 508 of the expandable device 500 can be allowed to expand toward engagement with the surrounding vessel walls at the treatment site by displacing the release line 504 from the constraining sleeve 502, thereby completing exclusion of the aneurysm from normal blood flow through the vessel, as shown in FIG. 8. [0044] Following deployment of the expandable device 500, the first and second catheters 300, 400 can be removed from the treatment site and body from respective treatment sites (not shown). [0045] Alternatively, at least one of the first and second catheters of the delivery system can be substantially more flexible than the other of the first and second catheters to facilitate traversing tortuous anatomy. For example, a first catheter can be chosen to be a Pebax material with an outer diameter of 0.5 inches and an inner diameter of 0.040 inches with a durometer of X. A second catheter can be chosen to be a Pebax material with an outer diameter of 0.2 inches and an inner diameter of 0.040 inches with a durometer of .45X. Other parameters can be varied to achieve different ratios of one catheter to the other. For example, the outer and inner diameters can be changed, a reinforcing member can be added to one or both of the catheters, or other suitable materials can be chosen. [0046] Alternatively, one or both of the first and second catheters can have substantially no column strength or at least can be flexible so as to not be effectively pushable into and through the vasculature. A potential advantage of having a catheter with substantially no column strength is the catheter can be more easily fed through a vessel (e.g. pushed by blood in an antegrade fashion or pulled by a snare through tortuous anatomy). For example, a first catheter can comprise a Pebax material with an outer diameter of about 8mm and an inner diameter of about 1 .1 mm with a durometer of X. A second catheter can comprise a Pebax material with an outer diameter of approximately 4 mm and an inner diameter of about 1 .1 mm with a durometer of about 0.5X. In another example, the second catheter can be an ePTFE tubular structure with desired outer and inner diameters. One such example of making an ePTFE tubular structure of approximately 8mm inner diameter and 8.14mm outer diameter is described below. Wrap a 80 cm long by 40mm wide by 0.03 mm thick and approximately 0.3 g/cc density of porous expanded PTFE film with an adhesive on one side of the expanded PTFE film about an 8mm diameter cylindrical stainless steel mandrel with the adhesive facing out and at least overlap the first layer longitudinal seam at least once, and then trim the excess film and heat the film-wrapped mandrel. The density of non-porous PTFE is about 2.2g/cc; consequently, this film is about 86% porous. [0047] Optionally, one or both of the first and second catheters can be tapered to facilitate entry into and movement through the vasculature. [0048] Alternatively, a delivery system can include a catheter having an elongated first portion and an elongated second portion, wherein a constrained device is mounted to the catheter in a constrained or delivery configuration between the first portion and second portion. The elongated first and second portions can be integral to form the catheter. Alternatively, the elongated first and second portions can be separate and connectable or releasably connectable to form the catheter. For example, a catheter 600 is shown in FIG. 9A having a first portion 602 and a second portion 604. The first portion 602 is elongated, extends along a first longitudinal axis 606 thereof, and terminates at a first end 603 of the catheter 600. Similarly, the second portion 604 is elongated, extends along a second longitudinal axis 608 thereof, and terminates at a second end 605 of the catheter 600. An expandable device 700 is supported on a middle section 610 of the catheter 600 between the first portion 602 and second portion 604. The expandable device 700 can be radially constrained in a delivery configuration suitable for endoluminal delivery. The catheter 600 can be inserted into the vasculature, as described above in other embodiments, such that the first portion 602 extends outwardly from a first access site 102' via a first introducer sheath 202' and the second portion 604 extends outwardly from a second access site 1 04', optionally via a second introducer sheath 204'. The first and second portions 602, 604 extending outside of the body can be pushed, pulled and rotated to axially and rotatably position the expandable device 500 at the treatment site. [0049] Alternatively, one of the elongated first and second portions of the catheter can have a smaller diameter than the other of the elongated first and second portions. For example, as shown in FIG. 9B, the second portion 604' of the catheter 600' can have a smaller diameter than the first portion 602' of the catheter 600'. [0050] Alternatively, one of the elongated first and second portions of the catheter can be substantially more flexible than the other of the elongated first and second portions of the catheter. [0051] Alternatively, one or both of the first and second portions of the catheter can have substantially no column strength or at least can be flexible so as to not be effectively pushable into and through the vasculature. [0052] Alternatively, the first and second portions of the catheter can be axially compressible toward each other to cause the catheter and implant to buckle. This buckling, when combined with rotation of the catheter may be useful in correct and accurate placement of an endoluminal device. [0053] Alternatively, one or both of the first and second portions of the catheter can be tapered toward the respective first and second ends to facilitate entry into and movement of the catheter through vasculature. [0054] Alternatively, one of the first and second catheters may in the form of an ePTFE fiber, wherein the fiber may not have an inner lumen. [0055] Referring to FIGS. 10-14, a delivery system is shown utilizing both trans-apical access and trans-femoral access sites, which allows push-pull positioning and delivery of an expandable implant inside of, at or near the heart through manipulation of at least two portions or members of the delivery system from outside of the body from the respective trans-apical and trans-femoral access sites. [0056] The delivery system can, for example, be used to deploy an endoprosthetic device, such as a stent graft for treating the ascending portion of the aortic arch or a valve device for replacing a failing valve. Continuing with these examples, a guidewire 1206 can be inserted through the trans-apical access site and into the left ventricle 1010 of the heart 1 100, as shown in FIG. 10. The guidewire 1206 can be routed through the aortic valve 101 2, the aorta 1014, a femoral artery of one of the legs, and out of the body via the trans-femoral access site (not shown), resulting in a "body floss" or "through-and-through" access configuration, wherein opposite terminal ends 1205, 1 207 of the guidewire 1206 extend outside of the body from respective trans-apical and trans-femoral access sites 1 102, 1 1 04, as shown in FIG. 1 1 . Optionally, the guidewire 1206 can be tensioned by pulling on the opposite ends 1205, 1207 of the guidewire 1206, as illustrated by the arrows "a" and "b" in FIG. 1 1 , to cause the guidewire 1206 to extend along the inside radius of the aortic arch. [0057] A first introducer sheath 1202 can be inserted over the guidewire 1206 and into the heart 1 1 00 via the trans-apical access site to facilitate introduction of surgical implements therethrough during the procedure. Similarly, a second introducer sheath (not shown) can be inserted over the guidewire 1206 to facilitate femoral introduction of surgical implements through the trans-femoral access site. [0058] Referring to FIG. 12, a first catheter, generally indicated at 1300, includes a leading end 1306 and an opposite trailing end 1322. The first catheter 1300 has a guidewire lumen 1310 through which the guidewire 1 206 can be routed. A first end 1205 of the guidewire 1206 can be inserted into the guidewire lumen 1 310 at the leading end 1306 of the first catheter 1 300. The leading end 1306 of the first catheter 1300 can be fed into the vasculature through the trans-apical access site 1 102 via the first introducer sheath 1 202. The first catheter 1300 can then be pushed along the guidewire 1206 in the direction indicated at 1302 until the leading end 1 306 exits the trans-femoral access site (not illustrated). The trailing end 1322 of the first catheter 1300 remains outside of the body and extends from the first access site 1 102 via the first introducer sheath 1 202. In this configuration, the catheter 1300 can be maneuvered by pushing or pulling the leading 1306 and trailing 1322 ends of the first catheter 1300 from outside of the body. Further, it should be noted that optionally tensioning the guidewire 1206, as illustrated in FIG. 1 1 , can result in the first catheter 300, or any other implement delivered over the guidewire 1206, tracking and remaining along the inside radius of the aortic arch, as shown in FIGS 12-14. [0059] Still referring to FIG. 12, a second catheter, generally indicated at 1400, includes a leading end 1406 and an opposite trailing end 1422. The second catheter 1400 has a guidewire lumen 1410 for receiving the guidewire 1206 therethrough. The second end 1207 of the guidewire 1206 can be inserted into the guidewire lumen 1410 at the leading end 1406 of the second catheter 1400. The second catheter 1400 can be pushed along the guidewire 1206 until the leading ends 306, 306 engage. [0060] An endoprosthetic device for treating a failing heart valve or disease along the ascending portion of the aorta or aortic arch can be releasably coupled to one of the first and second catheters at or near the leading end thereof. The endoprosthetic device can be releasably maintained or radially compressed toward a delivery configuration for endoluminal delivery by any suitable constraining means, such as a film constraining sleeve, a constraining tether or lattice, retractable sheath and the like. Optionally, one or more constraining means or combination of constraining means can be configured to allow staged expansion through one or more intermediate expanded states leading to full deployment. As shown in FIG. 12, for example, a device 1500 is releasably held in a delivery configuration coupled at or near the leading end 1406 of the second catheter 1400. [0061] The leading ends 1306, 1406 of the first and second catheters 1300, 1400 can be configured for matingly engaging or coupling to each other. Further, the leading ends 1306, 1406 can be configured for releasably coupling to each other. The leading ends 1306, 1406 of the first and second catheters 1300, 1400 can be coupled to each other extra corpeal ox in situ. Once the leading ends 1306, 1406 are coupled, the trailing ends 1 322, 1422 of the first and second catheters 1300, 1400 can be accessed outside of the body from the respective trans-apical 1 102 and trans-femoral 1202 access sites 1 102, 1 104 and pushed, pulled and rotated to axially and rotatably position the device 1500 at the treatment site, as shown in FIG. 13. After the device 1500 has been positioned at a desirable location and orientation at the treatment site, the device 1500 can be fully deployed to engage the surrounding tissues at the treatment site. [0062] Other surgical tools may be delivered through a third access point to the aortic arch through one of the major branch arteries along the aortic arch in connection with the deployment of the device at or in the heart or along the aortic arch. As shown in FIG. 14, for example, a filter 1 800 may be deployed to filter blood entering the branch arteries 1016, 1 018, 1 020. [0063] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present present disclosure without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. Thus, it is intended that the present present disclosure cover the modifications and variations of this present disclosure provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. 1 .
