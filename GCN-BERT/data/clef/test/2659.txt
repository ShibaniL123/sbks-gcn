Lure, especially for fishing The invention relates to a lure, especially for fishing, which comprises an elongated body, securing means for securing the lure to a fishing line or the like, cocking means for cocking at least two hooks in the cavity of the body. Spinning is an internationally widespread form of fishing, wherein a fishing lure is used at the end of a fishing line (or a wire trace possibly arranged at the end of a fishing line) for catching a haul. The most typical types of fishing lure are spoon, spinner and wobbler lures. The problem with these lures is the way they work in the natural habitats of specific fish species. The natural habitat of, for example, pike, sander and perch is in grassy or reedy shallows and stony reefs. Fishing in these areas with normal spinning lures, which are as such known to a person skilled in the art, is extremely demanding, because the hooks of the lures snag weeds or get caught in rocks in shallows. To eliminate this disadvantage, lures have been developed which comprise at least two separate hooks concealed in the body of the lure. An example of this type of lure is disclosed in the patent publication SE 90698. It describes hooks cocked inside the body by means of a clasp and a spring provided in one half of the body, the hooks being arranged to trigger outside the body when the body halves are pressed against each other. The arrangement does not, however, prevent the hooks from triggering outside the body even if the body is pressed only on the side on which the clasp is arranged. To function, this and other similar arrangements also require a flexible body material, which is not a very good material to be used in lures. Similar lures, which are arranged to trigger when a force is exerted on one side of the lure, are also known from the following publications: US patent application 2007/0101634 Al, US 4176489, US 2521555, WO 2012/101314 Al. The problem with all of the foregoing prior art lures is the triggering of the cocking of their individual hooks before the haul, that is, the fish snatches the hook. Using these lures is problematic at least in spinning, because the hook cockings trigger easily already at the stage when the lure is cast and hits the water on the side on which the force intended to trigger the hooks is exerted. Under the water surface, the lure will then encounter the same problems mentioned above as conventional lures do. Also, when this type of lure slides close to the bottom of the water, numerous obstacles, such as stones, grass or tree trunks may collide with the lure in such a way that the force exerted by the collision on one side of the lure body will trigger the cocking of the hook or hooks. The hook or hooks will then move outside the body, whereupon also the lure will encounter the same problems under the water as conventional lures do. The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the above-mentioned disadvantages with hook cocking means, wherein the unintentional or untimely triggering of the cocking of the hooks is completely eliminated. To achieve the aim of the invention, the lure according to the invention is characterised in that the cocking means include: hook-specific hook saddles, to each of which hook saddles a hook can be taken for cocking the hook, and hook-specific trigger means, and that the cocking means are arranged to prevent the triggering of the cocking of an individual hook saddle and the respective hook when triggering force is exerted on the respective single trigger means, but where a triggering force exerted simultaneously on the said trigger means effects the triggering of the cocking of at least two hook saddles and the respective hooks at the same time, thus allow- ing at least two hooks to move simultaneously out of the body cavity with the hook saddles. With the cocking means according to the invention, a functionally new type of lure can be provided, the at least two-hook cocking of which will trigger only when a simultaneous triggering force is exerted on the hook-specific trigger levers. In practice, this takes place when a fish catches the body of the lure in its mouth, whereupon a simultaneous triggering force is exerted on the body and the trigger levers. An impact of the cocked lure with water or contact with underwater obstacles cannot trigger the cocking of an individual hook or all hooks. Preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the accompanying dependent claims. The invention is described in greater detail in the following, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which: Figure 1 shows the cross-section of a lure according to an embodiment of the invention with the hooks cocked in the body cavity, Figure 2 shows the lure of Figure 1 with the hooks outside the body cavity. Figures 1 and 2 thus show a lure according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, which is marked with reference numeral 1. The lure 1 comprises an elongated body 2, which is preferably designed into the shape of a fish and is of the wobbler type. In the body 2 are provided securing means 3 by means of which the fishing line arranged in the fishing tackle (not shown) can be connected to the lure 1. In the body 2 is formed a cavity in which the cocking means 10 according to the invention are fitted. The purpose of the cocking means 10, the more detailed structure of which is described below, is to cock at least two hooks 4 inside the body 2 cavity, preferably in such a way that the hooks 4 are located completely inside the space defined by the outer surface of the body 2 so that the ends of the hooks 4 turn in opposite directions. The cocking means 10 include hook-specific trigger means 11, such as trigger levers 11. They are preferably arranged on opposite sides of the lure 1 body 2, in the vicinity of the outer surface of the body 2. The trigger levers 11 are connected to the body 2 so as to turn about the pivoted axles 11a transverse to the longitudinal direction of the body 2. An individual trigger lever 11 is arranged to turn against the force of a power element 13 arranged in conjunction with the body 2, such as a counter-spring, when the trigger force is exerted on the trigger lever 11. In this embodiment, there are thus two power elements 13, one for each trigger lever 11. In addition to this, the cocking means 10 preferably comprise hook saddles 12 or the like, fitted opposite to one another, at a distance from the respective trigger levers 11. In the hook saddle 12 is formed a slot or the like, into which an individual hook 4 can be placed for cocking the hooks 4. The hook saddles 12 are also arranged to turn about the pivoted axles 12a arranged on the body 2 transverse to the longitudinal direction of the body 2. In addition, the hooks 4 are fixed by means of an intermediate element 4a in conjunction with the body 2 of the lure 1 or a se- curing piece 4b arranged in conjunction with the hook saddle 12. The intermediate element 4a is, for example, a chain-like element which allows the hook 4 to detach from the hook saddle 12, but nonetheless keeps the hook 4 fixed to the lure 1 body 2. According to the invention, the trigger force exerted on a single trigger lever 11 in the cocking means 10 prevents the triggering of the cocking of the respective hook 4. Furthermore, the trigger force exerted simultaneously on the trigger levers 11 in turn brings about simultaneous triggering of the cocking of at least two hooks 4, thus allowing the simultaneous release of at least two hooks 4 from the body 2 cavi- ty. For this function, the cocking means 10 include a holding element 15. In the cocked state of the lure 1 according to Figure 1, the holding element 15 is fitted from its first end in conjunction with the contact surfaces 12b formed at the ends of the hook saddles 12 and from its second end in conjunction with the trigger levers 11 in the longitudinal central line area of the lure 1 or its vicinity. It is also conceivable to use the lure according to the invention with one hook. In this case, the simplest procedure is to remove one of the hooks 4, whereby the said hook saddle 12 remains empty. Instead of the said hook saddle 12, it is possible to have only a turning element (without a slot), in which is formed a contact surface 12b. The cocking means disclosed above function as follows. When a trigger force is exerted on only one trigger lever 11 of the cocked lure 1 of Figure 1, the said trigger lever 11 turns about its pivoted axle 11a, against the force of the respective power element 13, such as a counter-spring. In this case, the other trigger lever 11 is stationary, whereby the corresponding power element 13 effecting the second trigger lever 11 further exerts the force keeping the holding element 15 in place. It should be noted here that the purpose of the power elements 13 is to exert, when the lure 1 is cocked, by means of the trigger levers 11, a thrust on the holding element 15 which keeps the holding element 15 in its above-mentioned place. When a trigger force is exerted on both (all) trigger levers 11 of the cocked lure 1 of Figure 1, for example, when a fish snatches the lure 1 into its mouth, both trigger levers 11 turn about their pivoted axles 11a against the force of the respective pow- er element 13, such as a counter-spring. The force of the power elements 13 exert- ed on the holding element 15 to keep it in place is then cancelled out and the holding element 15 is released from contact with the hook saddles 12, moved by a force essentially opposite to the force generated by the power element 15a of the holding element 15, such as the power elements 13 of the thrust spring. The cocking of the lure 1 will then trigger into the position shown in Figure 2. This operation is possible when the force exerted by a single power element 13 on the holding element 15 is greater than the force exerted by the holding element 15 on the holding element 15 of the power element 15a. In Figure 2, the hooks 4, or at least their pointed ends are in this case turned with the hook saddles 12 outside the body 2 of the lure 1. The hook saddles 12 are arranged to turn by means of hook saddle specific power elements 14, such as springs, belonging to the cocking means 10. The contact surfaces 12b of the hook saddles 12 are designed in such a way that they settle against each other, "locking" the hook saddles 12 and the hooks 4 in them into the position shown in Figure 2. The hooks 4, or at least their pointed ends, are then outside the lure 1 body 2 and, if necessary, detach from the hook saddles 12. The intermediate elements 4a allow the hooks 4 to move when the haul attempts to free itself from the lure triggered from its cocking and provide better attachment to the haul. This mobility of the hooks 4 in the intermediate elements 4a also prevents the hooks 4 from being bent (which is a common problem with prior art lures) and the mechanics of the cocking means 10 from being damaged. It is possible to implement the turning the hooks 4 by positioning a pivoted axle 12a on the arm of the hook 4 (not shown in the Figures) and by fitting the power elements 14 in such a way that their thrust is exerted directly on the respective hook 4. In this case a hook saddle 12 is unnecessary. In Figure 2 is shown in broken lines a cover 20 fitted around the body 2, which can be detached and replaced when necessary. The purpose of the cover 20 is to give the lure its characteristic appearance preferably resembling, or fully imitating, a fish, and to protect the body 2 and cocking means 10 from the strain of use. The material of the cover 20 is preferably rubber, silicon or other resilient material which can be placed around the lure 1 body 2. The cover is preferably stretched tightly around the body 2, in such a way that it will not be able to detach or rotate when in place. To prevent this, the body 2 may be, for example, designed to include nodules or the like, which will prevent the body 2 and cover 20 from sliding unintentionally with respect to one another. Having been used several times, a conventional lure typically begins to wear on its surface and is finally broken, for example, due to fish bites, whereby the lure will no longer function in the best possible manner or is completely destroyed. A new lure will then have to be purchased, which is relatively expensive. The cover 20 according to the invention makes possible a much longer period of use of the lure 1 than this with a reasonable cost, since the cover 20 can be detached from the body 2 and be replaced with a new cover 20 which is significantly cheaper than a whole new lure. The body 2 itself and the cocking means 10 can be made of durable materials, such as plastic, metal alloys, carbon fibre composite, natural fibre composite and/or glass fibre composite. The detachable cover 20 also makes it possible to use different lure variations, for example regarding surface colours, in the same body 2 and cocking means. The cover 20 according to the invention has open- ings (not shown) which enable the hooks 4 and/or hook saddles 12 to be released from the body 2 cavity. Furthermore, the cocking means 10 may be made as a module separate from the lure 1 which can be placed afterwards in a cavity made in the lure 1 for this purpose and be fixed to the body 2 by mechanical fixing means 5, such as screws, and through fixing points formed by possible pivoted axles 11a and 12a.
