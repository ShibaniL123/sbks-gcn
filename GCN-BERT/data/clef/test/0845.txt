BODY CONTOUR ADAPTABLE AUTOINJECTOR DEVICE FIELD [0001] The disclosure relates to autoinjector devices. More particularly, the disclosure relates to an autoinjector device having a low profile, body contour adaptable construction and configuration. BACKGROUND [0002] Current autoinjector (AI) devices are held against the body while an injection needle pierces the skin to administer a pharmaceutical product or drug. The drug product or drug can comprise a monoclonal antibody or other protein. To operate the AI device, the user grips the device and applies a downward force against the skin that activates or arms the AI device. The user then presses a button with a finger or thumb to cause the needle to be deployed and the injection cycle to begin e.g. the syringe stopper/plunger arrangement moves the drug downward into the skin at the injection site. [0003] During needle insertion and stopper/plunger movement, the interface/surface area between the user’s skin and the AI device’s physical area touching the skin (and encompassing the needle) should remain in place to avoid device and/or needle slippage or movement on the surface of the skin. This occurs to enable a full drug dose delivery, to avoid drug leakage on the skin’s surface, and/or, to avoid user injury from a bent or broken needle during the injection process. Additionally, for user comfort, it is advised that the injection site’s skin area, and directly under the AI, be kept taut to facilitate the injection procedure. [0004] Most AI devices have a vertical or pen-like construction/profile, which does not provide a natural contour form that accommodates the shape of the human palm/hand/fingers. In addition, the vertical-elongated construction/profile of AI pen devices makes them difficult to hold stable against the body during an injection because the physical surface area of the device that contacts the skin is relatively small, which results in a concentration of compression forces and user discomfort. Consequently, device and/or needle slippage or movement often occurs, which can cause drug leakage on the skin’s surface, and user injury from a bent or broken needle during the injection process. Further, the use of AI pen devices can be a significant challenge for seniors or finger function compromised users (e.g., patients with arthritis) and consequently, treatment can be hindered. [0005] Accordingly, an improved AI device is needed which avoids the problems associated with conventional AI pen devices.

[0044] FIG. 2 is a sectional side view of the AI device of FIG. 1 [0045] FIG. 3 is a top view of the AI device of FIG. 1. [0046] FIG. 4 is another sectional side view of the AI device of FIG. 1. [0047] FIG. 5 is an enlarged sectional side view of an injection unit assembly shown in FIG. 4. [0048] FIG. 6 is a sectional top view of an embodiment of an AI device having four (4) injection unit assemblies. [0049] FIG. 7 is a top view of another embodiment of a drug container of the AI device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0050] It should be noted that while an autoinjector (AI) device is referred to throughout the disclosure, in some instances the device can also be referred to as an injector. [0051] The autoinjector (AI) device of the disclosure may be constructed and adapted to have a height that is substantially less than its width, thereby defining a low profile, which provides a larger more stable base that can pinch or stretch the skin in a controlled manner. Accordingly, the AI device can easily maintain a skin/device interface thereby providing controlled injection depth and drug delivery. The larger base can also accommodate larger volumes via multiple injection chambers (site within the base where injection is carried out) and/or large primary containers and/or primary containers that are combined to one another. The primary container can comprise, inter alia, prefilled syringes or vials. In some embodiments of the AI device, injection chambers are arranged to facilitate an active anchoring system which alleviates the need to maintain a constant force on the AI device. Further, in some embodiments, activation of needle deployment, drug delivery, and needle withdrawal (injection cycle) may be accomplished using the palm of the hand thereby allowing greater ease of use than existing autoinjectors and accommodating a broader user population especially for dexterity challenged users. [0052] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of an AI device 100. The AI device 100 may include a base 102, a flexible layer 104, a releasable substrate 106, a cover 110, a palm-button 112, one or more finger-pads 114, and one or more drug container viewing windows 116. The base 102 may be constructed out of an impact resistant, rigid material, such as polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (abs), or any other suitable material known to one of ordinary skill in the art. [0053] FIG. 2 is a sectional side view of the AI device 100 of FIG. 1. As shown, the base 102 may be a planar member having top and bottom surfaces. The base 102 may have a substantially larger surface area than conventional “pen-style” autoinjectors thereby providing a more stable body interface. In various embodiments, the base 102 may have a diameter of 5 cm to 15 cm. The bottom surface 102Β of the base 102 may be covered by the flexible layer 104, which may extend beyond the perimeter of the base 102. When the user presses the AI device 100 against the body, the flexible layer 104 allows the base 102 of the AI to conform to various contours of the user’s body while either elevating (pinching) or depressing (stretching) the user’s skin in a controlled manner, thereby forming a seal and vacuum between the base 102 and the skin of the user. The flexible layer 104 may be made of a bio-compatible (non-latex) material such as polyurethane, silicone-polyurethane co-polymer, hydro-gel, or any other suitable bio-compatible material capable of flexing that is known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the flexible layer 104 may define a concave skin-contact surface. The flexible layer 104 may be covered with the releasable substrate 106 that may be peeled off from the flexible layer 104 of the base 102 when the patient is ready to use the AI device 100. [0054] Referring to FIG. 2 and also to FIG. 3, which is a top view of the AI device 100, the cover 110 may have an ergonomic oval, dome-shape configuration which allows the injector to be easily gripped and/or handled, thereby allowing the AI device 100 to operated by a broader range of users. The cover 110 may be constructed out of an impact resistance rigid material such as polycarbonate, abs or any other suitable material known to one of ordinary skill in the art. It should be understood that the configuration is not limited to being dome-shaped and any shape that provides an appropriate ergonomic effect can be used, provided that it meets other criteria described herein. The palm-button 112 may be integrated into the apex A or any other region of the cover 110 and aids the user in pressing the cover 110 down toward the base 102 with the user’s palm to start an injection cycle of the AI device 100. The palm button 112 may be constructed out of a impact resistance rigid material, such as polycarbonate, abs, or any other suitable material known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and in some embodiments, may be coated with a bio-compatible (e.g. non-latex) material such as polyurethane, silicone-polyurethane co-polymer, or hydro-gel. Of course, other suitable materials known to one of skill in the art may also be used. In some embodiments, the palm-button 112 may extend entirely through the apex of the cover 110 so that it can coact with other components disposed within the AI device 100. In other embodiments, the palm-button 112 may only be integrated into a top surface HOT of the cover 110, at the apex thereof. In still further embodiments, the palm-button 112 may be integrated into the cover or top surface HOT thereof, in a location slightly offset from the apex. [0055] Referring still to FIG. 3, the one or more finger-pads 114 may be integrated into the cover’s top surface HOT at certain locations. The one or more finger-pads 114 allow the user to easily grip and/or handle the AI device 100 and may be constructed from a bio-compatible (non-latex) material such as polyurethane, silicone-polyurethane co-polymer, or hydro-gel. In some embodiments, the one or more finger-pads 114 may have a textured surface. The number of finger-pads 114 and their location on the cover 110 may be selected to meet a gripping requirement of a desired user population. For example, in some embodiments, the number and location of the finger-pads 114 may be selected to meet the gripping requirement of a user population having limited right-hand dexterity. In other embodiments, the number and location of the finger-pads 114 may be selected to meet the gripping requirement of a user population having limited left-hand dexterity. In still further embodiments, the number and location of the finger-pads 114 may be selected to meet the gripping requirement of a user population having limited leftand right-hand dexterity. [0056] In alternate embodiments of the AI device, the palm and one or more finger gripping pads may be replaced with a layer of material (not shown), which covers entire the top surface of the cover 110 and facilitates hand or finger gripping of the AI device 100. [0057] Referring again to FIG. 1, the one or more drug container viewing windows 116 may be formed in the cover 110. Each of the viewing windows allows the user to view a corresponding syringe or the drug contained therein, disposed within the AI device 100 or the level of drug within a syringe. In various other embodiments, the cover may have a window and mirror configuration for viewing the drug. [0058] Referring again to FIG. 2, the AI device 100 may further include one or more injection site isolators 124, an air vent arrangement 108, a palm-button support post 122, and one or more collapsible cover return posts 118 and corresponding return springs 120, disposed within an interior 126 of the device 100. The isolators 124 may be made from a rigid material, such as poly-carbonate or abs plastic and further coated with a bio-compatible (non-latex) material, such as polyurethane, silicone-polyurethane co-polymer, hydro-gel, or any other suitable material known to one of ordinary skill in the art, to enable greater traction or grip. The injection site isolators 124 may extend through coaxial-aligned openings (not visible) in the base 102 and the flexible layer 104. Some embodiments of the injection site isolator 124 may have a dome-like structure with a bottom edge 124Ε that lies generally flush with the working surface 104W (the surface applied to the user’s skin) of the flexible layer 104. The dome-like structure of the isolator 124 defines a space, which space forms an injection chamber 128 (FIG. 5). When the user presses the AI device 100 against his or her body, the isolator 124 pulls the skin located immediately below the isolator 124, up into injection chamber 128 defined therein. [0059] Referring still to FIG. 2, upon application of the injector 100 to the skin the air vent arrangement 108 is initially open to displace air. Once a pocket of air has been displaced, the vent arrangement 108 closes, as the cover 110 and the base 102 float or move with respect to each other. After injection, the spring back of the cover 110 relative to the base 102, reopens the vent arrangement 108 for air to rush in and release the vacuum. The suction/suction release functions of the vent arrangement 108 (which activates suction (vacuum) and venting for suction release) may be activated in some embodiments, as the cover 110 moves in the appropriate direction relative to the base 102, as indicated by arrow 129. The air vent arrangement 108, in some embodiments, may include a vent aperture (not visible) that extends through the base 102 and a closure (not visible) to block/close and unblock/open the vent aperture when the cover 110 moves relative to the base 102. When the vent aperture is open, air that may be disposed within the palm-button support post 122 of the AI device 100 or air trapped between the skin and the flexible layer 104, can pass therethrough, depending upon whether the AI device 100 is in a suction mode or a suction release mode. The collapsible cover return post 118 may conventionally comprise two or more telescoping elements operatively connected to the return spring 120, which may be a coil-type spring element. When the palm-button 112 is pressed, it moves the cover 110 down toward the base 102, thereby collapsing the extended cover return posts 118 and compressing the return springs 120. When the palm-button 112 is released, the collapsed cover return posts 118 extend and move the cover and palm-button 112 back to the undepressed position via the compressed return springs 120 which expand and extend the cover return posts 118 back to the uncollapsed position. [0060] FIG. 4 is another sectional side view of the AI device 100. As shown therein, the AI device 100 may further comprise one or more injection unit (IU) assemblies 130 operatively connected to a portion 112Ρ of the palm-button 112 that communicates with the interior 126 of the device 100. The multiple IU assemblies 130 are possible because the base 102 of the AI device 100 has a substantially larger mounting surface than conventional “pen-style” autoinjectors. The one or more IU assemblies 130 are positioned within the AI device 100 so that their longitudinal axes may be at an acute angle relative to the base 102, rather than perpendicular to the base 102 as in conventional “pen-style” autoinjectors, to lower the profile of the AI device 100 and increase the stability and ease of use of the device 100. Each IU assembly 130 is operatively associated with an injection chamber 128 provided by a corresponding injection site isolator 124. The IU assemblies 130 and palm-button 112 can be constructed and adapted to provide synchronous and/or asynchronous activation of the IU assemblies 130. Embodiments of the AI device 100 with multiple IU assemblies 130 provide single and/or multiple injection chamber 128 options (e.g. two, three or four injection chambers 128) that allow for larger, combined fluid deliveries, and/or different fluid deliveries, and provide variable injection chambers 128 and locations and configurations to accommodate and adjust drug volumes and avoid injection site reactions. The use of multiple injection chambers 128 can provide active anchoring of the AI device 100 through the configuration of the injection site needle insertion. [0061] FIG. 5 is an enlarged sectional side view of one of the IU assemblies 130 shown in FIG. 4. Each of the IU assemblies 130 may optionally include a heating element 132, a syringe carrier 134, a syringe 136, a carrier drive 138, a plunger drive 140, and a needle guide 142. Each of the IU assemblies 130 may be secured to the base 102 by a support structure 150 formed on or attached to a top surface 102Τ of the base 102. [0062] Still referring to FIG. 5, the syringe carrier 134 may be constructed and adapted to receive and securely hold the syringe 136 to facilitate needle insertion, drug extrusion, and needle retraction. In some embodiments where the AI device 100 is reusable, the syringe carrier 134 may be constructed and adapted to allow the syringe 136 to be removed after an injection cycle of the AI device 100 and replaced with a new syringe. The syringe carrier 134 may be mounted on, in, or to the support structure 150 so that it is capable of moving in a linear manner relative to the support stmcture 150 (and the base 102), from a needle retracted position (as shown in FIG. 5), to a needle inserted position (not shown), and then back to the needle retracted position, during an injection cycle of the AI 100. In the shown embodiment, the carrier 134 includes drive abutment tabs 134Τ. The carrier drive 138 uses the drive abutment tabs 134Τ to move the carrier 134 from the needle retracted position to the needle inserted position and back to the needle retracted position. [0063] Referring still to FIG. 5, the syringe 136 may conventionally comprise a generally tubular container or barrel 136Β, a hypodermic needle 136Ν or any other element capable of penetrating the user’s skin and dispensing a pharmaceutical product or drug into the user, removably or permanently secured to or connected by another conduit to a forward end 136BF of the barrel 136Β, a stopper 136S slidably disposed within the barrel 136Β, and a plunger rod 136Ρ having a forward end (not visible) operatively engaged with or connected to the stopper 136S and a rearward end 136PR extending out from the barrel 136Β at an open rearward end 136BR thereof. A removable, generally tubular needle shield 136NS may be disposed over the needle 136Ν. The syringe 136 may be filled for treatment or be prefilled with a single dose of a pharmaceutical product or drug. Any other suitable primary container and piercing element arrangement, such as cartridges, ampoules and the like, may be used in place of the syringe 136 in other embodiments of the AI device 100 to penetrate a user’s skin and dispense a pharmaceutical product or drug into the user. [0064] Referring still to FIG. 5, the heating element 132, if included in the device, may contact at least a portion of the primary container 136 and is provided for heating the drug contained within the container 136 prior to injection. In some embodiments, the heating element 132 may comprise a sodium acetate-based exothermic heating element. Such a heating element may comprise a trigger-activated sodium acetate bag having a trigger member in the flexible bag for activating the sodium acetate solution. In some embodiments, the heating element 132 can be constructed to be activated by pressing the palm-button 112 such that initial downward movement of the palm-button 112 activates the heating element 132. [0065] In some embodiments of the AI device 100, only one of the IU assemblies 130 may be carrying a syringe 136 with a dose of a pharmaceutical product. The number of the IU assemblies 130 carrying a syringe 136 with a dose of a pharmaceutical depends upon the user’s therapy. In various embodiments, the number of IU assemblies can be from one to four, although embodiments with more than four IU assemblies are contemplated, depending upon the user’s therapy. In addition, the type of pharmaceutical product and/or the volume of the dose contained in the IU assemblies 130 can be the substantially the same or vary from one IU assembly 130 to another, depending upon the desired treatment. [0066] FIG. 6 is a sectional top view of the AI device 100 having four (4) IU assemblies 130. As shown therein, the IU assemblies 130 may be arranged so that their longitudinal axes are at right angles to one another. [0067] As shown in FIG. 7, other embodiments of the AI device may have IU assemblies that each includes two or more containers 236C1,236C2 instead of a syringe. The containers 236C1,236C2 may coextend relative to one another. The forward end 23 6F of each of the containers 236 may be connected to a common hypodermic needle 236Ν via a bridge conduit 236CD. Each container 236C1, 236C2 may include a stopper 236S1, 236S2 and a plunger rod 236Ρ1, 236Ρ2. A removable, generally tubular needle shield 236NS may be disposed over the needle 236Ν or other piercing element. The containers 236C1, 236C2 may each be filled for treatment or be prefilled with a single dose of a pharmaceutical product or drug. Alternatively, the containers 236C1 and 236C2 can be each filled for treatment or be prefilled with a different drug. The type of pharmaceutical product and/or the volume of the dose contained in the containers 236C1, 236C2 can be the substantially the same or vary from one container to another, depending upon the desired treatment. [0068] Referring again to FIG. 5, the carrier drive 138 may use the drive tabs 134Τ of the syringe carrier 134 to move the carrier 134 containing the syringe 136 from the needle retracted position, where the needle 136Ν is concealed, to the needle inserted position during a needle insertion process of the AI device injection cycle, thereby causing the needle 136Ν to extend out from the AI device 100, into the injection chamber 138 may also use the drive tabs 134Τ of the syringe carrier 134 to move the carrier 134 containing the syringe 136 back to the needle retracted position from the needle inserted position, thereby withdrawing the needle 136Ν from the user’s skin drawn into the injection chamber 128 and concealing it within the AI device 100. As shown in FIG. 5, some embodiments of the carrier drive 138 may include hollow spring-holding rails 138R, insertion springs 138IS, retraction springs 138RS, carrier trigger rails 138TR, a carrier trigger rail connector 138RC, insertion spring holds 138SH, retraction spring holds 138RH, and a pivoting carrier trigger 138Τ. [0069] Still referring to FIG. 5, the spring-holding rails 138R may extend generally parallel to the syringe carrier 134 along an outer surface thereof. The rearward ends of the spring-holding rails 138R may be connected to opposing ends of the carrier trigger rail connector 138RC. The carrier trigger rail connector 138RC, in turn, may be connected to the carrier trigger 138Τ. The carrier trigger 138Τ may operatively connect the carrier drive 138 to the portion 112Ρ of the palm-button 112 that extends through the cover 110 into the interior 126 of the AI device 100 (FIG. 4). The insertion springs 138 IS and retraction springs 138RS may be contained within the hollow spring-holding rails 138R with each insertion spring 138IS disposed behind a rear abutment surface 134TR of its corresponding drive tab 134Τ and each retraction spring 138 RS may be engaged with a front abutment surface 134RF of its corresponding drive tab 134Τ. The insertion spring holds 138SH may be selectively positioned on the carrier trigger rails 138 TR to engage and compress the insertion springs 138IS prior to the commencement of an injection cycle of the AI injection, thereby holding the syringe carrier 134 in the needled retracted position. When the palm-button 112 and cover 110 are pressed down toward the base 102 to activate an injection cycle of the AI device 100, the carrier trigger 138Τ may pivot and cause the carrier trigger rails 138R to disengage the insertion spring holds 138 SH from the compressed insertion springs 138IS. Once disengaged, the insertion springs 138IS may expand and engage the rear abutment surfaces 134TR of the syringe carrier drive tabs 134Τ and move the syringe carrier 134 from the needle retracted position to the needle inserted position. As the syringe carrier 134 moves to the needle inserted position, the retraction springs 138RS, which are generally uncompressed, may engage the front abutment surfaces 134TF of the carrier drive tabs 134Τ (in the needle retracted position), and compress via the spring forces exerted on rear abutment surfaces 134TR of the tabs 134 by the expanding insertion springs 138IS. The insertion springs 138IS may have a higher spring rate than the retraction springs 138RS so that they can compress the retraction springs 138RS and move the syringe carrier 134 to the needle inserted position. [0070] The retraction spring holds 138RH may be selectively positioned on the carrier trigger rails 138TR so that as the palm-button 112 and cover 110 are pressed further down toward the base 102 and the syringe carrier 134 reaches the needle inserted position, the pivoting carrier trigger 138Τ causes the carrier trigger rails 138TR to engage the retraction spring holds 138RH with the compressed retraction springs 138 RS to hold them in the compressed state until the plunger drive 140 completes drug extrusion. Once drug extrusion is completed and as the palm-button 112 and cover 110 are pressed completely down toward the base 102, the pivoting carrier trigger 138Τ may cause the carrier trigger rails 138R to disengage the retraction spring holds 138RH from the compressed retraction springs 138RS. Once disengaged, the retraction springs 138RS may expand and engage the front abutment surfaces 134TR of the syringe carrier drive tabs 134Τ and move the syringe carrier 134 from the needle inserted position back to the needle retracted position. [0071] Referring still to FIG. 5, the plunger drive 140 may push the plunger rod 136Ρ and the stopper 136S, which is operatively connected to the forward end of the plunger rod 136Ρ, down through the syringe barrel 136Β to extrude the drug contained within the barrel 136Β through the needle 136Ν and into the user during the drug extrusion process of the AI injection cycle. As shown, some embodiments of the plunger drive 140 may include a pivoting plunger trigger 140Τ, a plunger hold 140Η, and a plunger drive spring 140S. The plunger hold 140 Η has one end operatively connected to the plunger trigger 140Τ and the other end engaged with the plunger rod 136Ρ. The plunger drive spring 140 may be operatively connected to the plunger rod 136Ρ so that in the initial needle retracted position, it is held in a compressed state. When the palm-button 112/cover 110 are pressed down toward the base 102 to activate an injection cycle of the AI device 100, the plunger trigger 140Τ (as well as the carrier trigger 138Τ) starts to pivot. When the syringe carrier 134 reaches the needle inserted position which causes the needle 136Ν to penetrate the user’s skin, the pivoting plunger trigger 140Τ causes the plunger hold 140Η to release the plunger rod 136Ρ. Once released, the compressed plunger drive spring 140S expands and pushes the plunger rod 136Ρ and the stopper 136S down through the syringe barrel 136Β, thereby extruding the drug contained within the barrel 136Β through the needle 136Ν into the user. [0072] Referring again to FIG. 4, in one embodiment the releasable substrate 106 which covers the flexible layer 104 of the base 102 may be constructed as a need shield remover by providing barb-style or like gripping elements or projections 106G that extend up from the top surface 106Τ of the substrate 106, into the injection chambers 128 and grip the needle shields 136NS (FIG. 5). When the user is ready to use the AI device 100, he or she simply peels the releasable substrate 106 off the flexible layer 104 to remove all the needle shields 136NS covering the needles 136 Ν at essentially the same time. To facilitate removal of the releasable substrate 106, a pull tab structure 106ΡΤ may be attached to the bottom surface 106Β of the substrate 106. The pull tab structure 106ΡΤ may include opposing portions 106ΟΡ that each has a thickness that gradually increases moving from a center 106C of the pull tab structure 106 ΡΤ. The pull tab structure 106ΡΤ may also be provided with two parallel lines of weakness 106L located adjacent the center 106C thereof that allow the two thick outer opposing portions 106ΟΡ of the pull tab structure 106ΡΤ to be folded together to form a pull tab (not shown) which can be easily gripped and pulled with the fingers to remove the peelable substrate 106 from the flexible layer 104 of the base 102. [0073] Other embodiments of the AI device may have various other types of carrier and/or plunger drive mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms may utilize stored energy in any known form including, without limitation, electrical, gas pressure, gas releasing, or any combination thereof. The stored energy can be transmitted by corresponding conventional transmission mechanisms, e.g. electromechanical, such as electric motors or activation unit may be provided for activating and sequencing the drive mechanisms and may comprise any well know type of a releasable lock arrangements, electronic controllers, combinations thereof, and the like. [0074] The syringe(s) or other primary container(s) of the AI device may be filled for treatment or be prefilled with a pharmaceutical product, such as an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA), which may be in a liquid or a lyophilized form.
