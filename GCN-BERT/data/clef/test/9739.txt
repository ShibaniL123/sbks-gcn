BACKGROUND According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) fact sheet on Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), CVDs are the number one cause of death globally. (Fact Sheet No. 317, September 2012 accessed at (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs317/en/index.html on Jan. 31, 2013). The WHO estimates that an estimated 17.3 million people died from CVDs in 2008, representing 30% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, an estimated 7.3 million were due to coronary heart disease (CHD) and 6.2 million were due to stroke. The WHO also estimates that by 2030, almost 25 million people will die from CVDs, mainly from heart disease and stroke. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that the developing countries contributed 3.5 million of the 6.2 million global deaths from CHD in 1990. (Murray C J L and Lopez A D. The Global Burden of Disease A Comprehensive Assessment of Mortality and Disability from Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors in 1990 and Projected to 2020. Boston, Mass. Harvard University Press; 1996). The projections estimate that these countries will account for 7.8 million of the 11.1 million deaths due to CHD in 2020. The developed countries are not immune to CHD. For example, in the USA and Europe, CHD remains the largest single cause of death and disability. In 2005, CHD caused approximately 1 of every 5 deaths in the USA. (Heron M P, et. al. Deaths preliminary data for 2006. Natl. Vital. Stat. Rep. 2008; 56:1-52.) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention it is the leading cause of death in America. Approximately 37% of people who develop a coronary event in a given year will die from it. While major reductions in CVD related mortality have been achieved in Europe, CVD still accounts for 54% of all deaths in women and 43% of all deaths in men. CVD is associated with many risk factors. Of these risk factors, hyperlipidemia (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia) and hypercholesterolemia are significant indicators of CVD. As such, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, and prescribed drugs containing Omega-3 fatty acid esters, such as the ethyl esters of EPA and DHA, are currently used for the treatment of CVD and, in particular, for the reduction of elevated triglycerides. However, administration of dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, and prescribed drugs containing Omega-3 fatty acid esters presents significant challenges. For example, current dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, and prescribed drugs containing Omega-3 fatty acid esters have variable absorption and efficacy when orally administered. In particular, current compositions have a pronounced “food effect,” with poor absorption when taken while fasting or with a low fat meal. When taken with fatty foods, the absorption of Omega-3 fatty acid esters improves, due in part to the presence of bile salts that are released in the intestines, which aid absorption of Omega-3 fatty acid esters. To overcome low absorption, patients can be dosed with compositions having greater amounts of Omega-3 fatty acid esters, but there are practical limitations to this approach due to the side effects that are commonly associated with such compositions. The oxidative degradation of Omega-3 fatty acid esters that occurs over time can result in an unpleasant aftertaste following administration, especially when consumed in large quantities. Burping and stomach upset are further unpleasant side effects associated with the consumption of Omega-3 fatty acid esters. Following consumption, Omega-3 fatty acid esters tend to float on top of liquid contents in the stomach, forming a layer that prevents the passage of small gas bubbles. When sufficient gas has built up to overcome the surface tension of the oil layer, a person burps. The burps usually contain a fishy taste and smell. Accordingly, side effects associated with the administration of current compositions comprising Omega-3 fatty acid esters (e.g., susceptibility to the food effect, large doses to attain efficacy, and the resulting aftertaste, unpleasant smell, and burping) are known to significantly reduce patient compliance. While practicing a healthy lifestyle may reduce the incidence of CVD, new therapeutic approaches to manage CVD are warranted. These new approaches might include the discovery of new drugs or improve upon current medications used to treat CVD. The discovery of new drugs, however, comes at a high price with no certainty of eventual success. Accordingly, new or more efficient ways of delivering current medications with a proven safety and efficacy profile should be developed. Thus, there is a need for improved compositions comprising Omega-3 fatty acid esters, such as the ethyl esters of EPA and DHA, that are less susceptible to food effect and which attain high efficacy at lower doses. Ideally, such improved compositions would minimize or eliminate an unpleasant smell and/or an unpleasant aftertaste, and/or burping in the patient. Such an improved composition with reduced side effects would improve patient compliance and more effectively treat the risk factors related to cardiovascular disease.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Certain aspects, modes, embodiments, variations and features of the invention are described herein in various levels of detail to provide further understanding of embodiments related to compositions comprising Omega-3 fatty acid esters, and methods related to using such compositions containing a high concentration of Omega-3 fatty acid esters. In certain embodiments, an EPA ester and DHA ester are present in specific weight ratio percentages and relative amounts. As noted, these compositions have beneficial effects on certain risk factors for CVD, including the lowering of serum triglycerides and serum cholesterol. DEFINITIONS As used herein, the term “composition(s)” or “formulation(s)” includes therapeutic and dietary compositions including, but not limited to a dietary supplement, nutraceutical formulation, or pharmaceutical formulation. Further, the terms composition, dietary supplement, nutraceutical formulation, and pharmaceutical formulation are used interchangeably herein. As used herein, the term “EPA” refers inclusively to (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentenoic acid or derivatives thereof, including alkyl esters, such as, for example, the ethyl ester. As used herein, the term “DHA” inclusively refers to (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid or derivatives thereof, including alkyl esters, such as, for example, the ethyl ester. As used herein, the term “micelle” (plural micelles, micella, or micellae) refers to an aggregate of molecules, that have assembled into an approximately spherical core/shell architecture, and are suspended in an aqueous phase. A typical micelle in aqueous solution forms an aggregate with the hydrophilic “head” regions in contact with surrounding solvent and/or in contact with the polar region of one or more surface active agent(s), sequestering the hydrophobic regions in the micelle center. Micelles are approximately spherical in shape. The term “self-micellizes” as used herein refers to the process in which micelles are formed in an aqueous medium without the introduction of energy, including agitation or shearing. As used herein, the term “aqueous medium” refers to any solution or suspension, that comprises water, including for example, without limitation, water by itself; phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4, Sprite, apple juice, G-2 fruit punch, and chocolate milk. In certain embodiments, an aqueous medium comprises at least one fluid having an acidic pH. In certain other embodiments, an aqueous medium comprises a biological fluid such as, for example and without limitation, stomach acid. In other embodiments, the aqueous medium comprises simulated stomach acid comprising 0.1N HCl. As used herein, the term “free fatty acid” refers to one or more polyunsaturated fatty acids that have not been modified or do not have any other groups attached. As used herein, the term “ester” refers to the replacement of the hydrogen in the carboxylic acid group of a polyunsaturated fatty acid molecule with another substituent. Typical esters are known to those in the art, a discussion of which is provided by Higuchi, T. et al., Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, A.C.S. Symposium Series, Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, Ed. Edward B. Roche, Amer. Pharma. Assoc., Pergamon Press (1987), and Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, McOmie ed., Plenum Press, New York (1973), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in the entirety. Examples of common esters include methyl, ethyl, trichloroethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, tert-butyl, benzyl, nitrobenzyl, methoxybenzyl, benzhydryl, monoglyceride, diglyceride, triglyceride. As used herein, the term “monoglyceride” refers to a fatty acid chain, such as DHA or EPA molecule, covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through an ester linkage. As used herein, the term “diglyceride” refers to a fatty acid chain such as DHA or EPA, covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through an ester linkage, wherein the glycerol molecule is further bonded to one additional fatty acid chain, which may or may not be DHA or EPA, through one additional ester linkage. As used herein, the term “triglyceride” refers to a fatty acid chain, such as DHA or EPA, covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through an ester linkage, wherein the glycerol molecule is further bonded to two additional fatty acid chains, either or both of which may or may not be DHA or EPA, through two additional ester linkages. As used herein, the term “terpene” refers to the large and diverse class of organic compounds produced by a variety of plants, particularly conifers. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as “terpenoids” (e.g., carvone). Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. As used herein, the terms “α-Tocopherol,” “tocopherol,” and “vitamin E” each refer to a set of tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are fat-soluble vitamins with antioxidant properties. As used herein, the term “antioxidant” refers to a molecule capable of inhibiting the oxidation of other molecules. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons or hydrogen from a substance to an oxidizing agent. Oxidation reactions can produce free radicals. In turn, these radicals can start chain reactions. When the chain reaction occurs in a cell, it can cause damage or death to the cell. Antioxidants terminate these chain reactions by removing free radical intermediates, and inhibit other oxidation reactions. They do this by being oxidized themselves, so antioxidants are often reducing agents such as thiols, ascorbic acid, or polyphenols. Exemplary antioxidants include rosemary oil, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), glutathione, lipoic acid, uric acid, carotenes, melatonin, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q), α-tocopherol (vitamin E), acorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, monothioglycerol, and potassium metabisulfite. As used herein, a pharmaceutically acceptable “carrier” refers to any substance suitable as a vehicle for delivering a molecule or composition to a suitable in vivo site of absorption. Examples of such carriers include, but are not limited to water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, serum-containing solutions, Hank's solution and other aqueous physiologically-balanced solutions. As used herein, a pharmaceutically acceptable “preservative” includes but is not limited to potassium sorbate, methylparaben, propylparaben, benzoic acid and its salts, other esters of parahydroxybenzoic acid such as butylparaben, alcohols such as ethyl or benzyl alcohol, phenolic compounds such as phenol, or quarternary compounds such as benzalkonium chloride. As used herein, a “coloring agent” provides coloration to the composition or dosage form. Such coloring agents include food grade dyes. As used herein, the term “subject” refers to a mammal, including but not limited to a dog, cat, horse, cow, pig, sheep, goat, chicken, rodent, primate or human. Subjects include animals such as house pets (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), agricultural stock subjects (e.g., cows, horses, pigs, chickens, etc.), laboratory subjects (e.g., mice, rats, rabbits, etc.), but are not so limited. The human subject may be a pediatric, adult, or a geriatric subject. The human subject may be of either gender. As used herein, the terms “cardiovascular disease” and “cardiovascular condition” include disorders of the heart and vasculature, including, for example, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, transient ischemic attack, systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, aneurysm, aortic dissection, myocardial ischemia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), angina pectoris, unstable angina (UA), and stable angina (SA), myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, dilated congestive cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, corpulmonale, arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, endocarditis, pulmonary embolism, venous thrombosis, peripheral vascular disease, and peripheral artery disease. Hypertriglyceridemia, for example, is a condition related to cardiovascular disease in which fasting blood serum concentrations of triglycerides are ≧150 mg/dL. Blood concentrations can rise from moderately high levels of 200 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL, or in severe cases, above 500 mg/dL. The American Heart Association has categorized triglyceride concentrations as “normal” (below 150 mg/dL), “elevated” (150 to 199 mg/dL), “high” (200 to 499 mg/dL), and “very high” (above 500 mg/dL). It will be evident to the skilled practitioner that the categorization of hypertriglyceridemia can vary from country to country. For example, Canadian and European guidelines recommend fasting blood serum triglyceride levels of less than 1.7 mmol/L as “desirable”, from 1.7 to 2.2 mmol/L as “borderline high” and 2.3 to 5.6 mmol/L as “high” and above 5.6 mmol/L as “very high”. The skilled practitioner will also appreciate that what constitutes elevated blood serum triglyceride levels may vary based on age and gender. As used herein, an “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” of a composition as described in some embodiments herein can be a quantity sufficient to achieve a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect, for example, an amount which results in the prevention of, or a decrease in the symptoms associated with, a disease that is being treated. The amount of composition administered to the subject, particularly one in need of the composition, can depend on the type and severity of the disease and on the characteristics of the individual, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. A person skilled in the art will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors. Typically, an effective amount of the compositions described herein can be sufficient for achieving a therapeutic or prophylactic effect. The terms “dose unit,” “unit dose,” and “dosage unit,” as used herein, refer to a portion of a composition that contains an effective amount of an active suitable for a single administration to provide, or contribute to, a therapeutic effect. Such dosage units may be administered one to a plurality (i.e., 1 to about 10, 1 to 8, 1 to 6, 1 to 4 or 1 to 2) of times per day, or as many times as needed to elicit a therapeutic response. The term “food effect,” as used herein, refers to a relative difference in AUC (area under the curve), Cmax (maximum plasma concentration), and/or Tmax (time to maximum concentration) of an active substance, when said substance or a composition thereof, such as a tablet, a capsule or a liquid, is administered orally to a subject concomitantly with food or in a fed state as compared to the same values when the same composition is administered in a fasted state. The food effect, F, is calculated as: [in-line-formulae]F=(Yfed−Yfasted)/Yfasted [/in-line-formulae] wherein Yfed and Yfasted are the found values of AUC, Cmax, or Tmax in the fed and fasted state, respectively. A food effect, F, is generally established when F>1. In general, the term “AUC” or “area under the plasma concentration-time curve” is related to the total amount of an active measurable in the systemic circulation following administration of a single dose. The AUC is a mathematical and visual representation of the aggregate amount of the active in the systemic circulation over a given period of time. Changes in the AUC need not necessarily reflect changes in the total amount of the active absorbed but can reflect modifications in the kinetics of distribution, metabolism and excretion. Accordingly, the term AUC as used herein refers to the total amount of Omega-3 fatty acids measurable in the systemic circulation following administration of a single dose of any of the compositions described herein. The term “Tmax” or “time of peak concentration” refers to the period of time required to achieve peak plasma concentration of an active after administration of a single dose. Accordingly, the term Tmax as used herein refers to the period of time required to achieve peak plasma concentration of Omega-3 fatty acid esters after administration of a single dose of any of the compositions described herein. The term “Cmax” or “peak concentration” is the highest concentration of an active achieved in the blood plasma. Accordingly, the term Cmax as used herein refers to the maximum concentration of Omega-3 fatty acid esters after administration of a single dose of any of the compositions described herein. The term “substantially independent of a food effect,” or “substantially free of food effect” as used herein, refers to a substantial elimination of the effect of food upon the absorption (e.g., F is about 0), following oral administration, of any of the compositions described herein. In other words, the bioavailability of the Omega-3 fatty acid esters, as measured by the logarithm-transformed AUC, is substantially the same regardless of whether the compositions described herein are administered with or without food. In certain embodiments, the pharmacological effects of administration of compositions described herein are substantially independent of a food effect. The term “reduced food effect,” as used herein, as used herein, refers to a substantial reduction in the effect of food upon the absorption, following oral administration, of any of the compositions described. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein have a reduced food effect. The term “concomitantly with food” or “administration in the fed state,” as used herein, refers to administration from about 30 minutes before a meal to about 1 hour after a meal. Various modes of treatment or prevention of medical conditions as described herein are intended to mean “substantial” or “substantially”, which includes total but also less than total treatment or prevention, and wherein some biologically or medically relevant result is achieved. A subject, such as a human subject, in need of treatment refers to a subject in need of treatment of a defined disease state or in need of preventative treatment (i.e., prophylaxis) of such a disease state. The term “about” or “approximately” as used herein means within an acceptable error range for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the value is measured or determined, i.e., the limitations of the measurement system. Where particular values are described in the application and claims, unless otherwise stated, the term “about” means within an acceptable error range for the particular value. The term “active(s)”, “active ingredient(s)”, “active agents” or “pharmaceutically active ingredient” means a chemical entity intended to furnish pharmacological activity or to otherwise have direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or to have direct effect in restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions in a subject. The term “functional food” as used herein means any edible or drinkable foods or dietary components (e.g., juices, milk, yogurt, butter, margarine, baking products) that are fortified or enhanced with any of the compositions described herein. The functional food can be, e.g., solid, liquid, semisolid, or a combination thereof. The term “functional food” also encompasses edible and drinkable nutritional supplements. The term “hydrophilic-lipophilic balance” or “HLB,” as used herein, refers to the relative affinity of a substance or composition for aqueous and oily phases. HLB values can be calculated based on methods and equations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,192. Substances or compositions generally have an average HLB of about 6 to about 20. Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance values can be determined in a variety of the formulas or experimental methods provided, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,192. The term “substantially pure” as used herein means at least 90% pure.

In certain embodiments, a method is provided of minimizing and/or eliminating side effects from the oral administration of Omega-3 fatty acid esters in the presence of a surface active agent to a subject in need of treatment comprising administering a composition of any one of the embodiments provided herein or the micelles of any one of the embodiments provided herein. In certain embodiments, the method of minimizing side effects eliminates the onset of side effects. In some embodiments, non-limiting examples of the side effects include regurgitation, frequency of belching, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), bloating, increased intestinal gas, fish taste, fishy breath, fish smell, nausea, diarrhea, or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, a method is provided of minimizing and/or eliminating side effects from the oral administration of Omega-3 fatty acid esters in the presence of at least one terpene or natural orange oil to a subject in need of treatment comprising administering a composition of any one of the embodiments provided herein or the micelles of any one of the embodiments provided herein. In certain embodiments, the at least one terpene is typically, but not necessarily d-limonene that is at least 95% pure. In certain embodiments, the method of minimizing side effects eliminates the onset of side effects. In some embodiments, non-limiting examples of the side effects include regurgitation, frequency of belching, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), bloating, increased intestinal gas, fish taste, fishy breath, fish smell, nausea, diarrhea, or combinations thereof. Some embodiments provide for a method of reducing a food effect in a subject in need of treatment, which method comprises administering to a human subject a therapeutically effective amount of any one of the compositions described herein. In certain embodiments, the food effect is substantially eliminated. Methods are also provided for improving patient compliance during the oral administration of Omega-3 fatty acid esters to a subject in need of treatment comprising administering a composition as described herein. The compositions described herein can be administered to a human subject in need of such administration with a non-Omega-3 fatty acid ester lipid-lowering or cholesterol lowering agent selected from the group consisting of cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants/resins, statins, niacin and derivatives, MTP inhibitors, fibrates and CETP inhibitors. These lipid-lowering or cholesterol lowering agents can be categorized by their mechanism of action. For example, cholesterol absorption inhibitors inhibit absorption of dietary cholesterol and inhibit reabsorption of biliary cholesterol. Examples of cholesterol absorption inhibitors include, but are not limited to, phytosterols, ezetimibe, and (3R,4S)-1,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3-phenylpropyl)-2-azetidinone (SCH 48461). Bile acid sequestrants/resins are polymeric compounds and function as ion exchange resins. Bile acid sequestrants exchange anions such as chloride ions for bile acids. By doing so, they bind bile acids and sequester them from enterohepatic circulation. Since bile acid sequesterants are large polymeric structures, they are not well-absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream. Thus, bile acid sequestrants, along with any bile acids bound to the drug, are excreted via the feces after passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Examples of bile acid sequestrants/resins include, but are not limited to cholestyramine, colesevelam, and colestipol. Statins are a class of compounds that inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Examples of statins include, but are not limited to rosuvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin. It is believed that niacin and its derivatives function by stimulating the G-protein coupled receptor GPR109A, which causes the inhibition of fat breakdown in adipose tissue. Examples of niacin and its derivatives include, but are not limited to, niceritrol, niacin, nicofuranose, aluminium nicotinate, nicotinyl alcohol, and acipimox. MTP (Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein) is a lipid transfer protein that is required for the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins by the liver and chylomicrons by the intestine. Accordingly, inhibitors of MTP decrease levels of plasma LDL-C. Examples of MTP inhibitors include, but are not limited to, lomitapide for human use and dirlotapide and mitrapatide for veterinary use in dogs. Rodent and human studies suggest that fibrates exert their hypolipidemic effects via several mechanisms. Examples of fibrates include, but are not limited to bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, clofibrate, gemfibrozil, and fenofibrate. CETP (Cholesterylester Transfer Protein) inhibitors improve blood plasma lipid profiles by increasing HDL (“good” cholesterol containing particle) and decreasing LDL (“bad” cholesterol containing particle). Examples of CETP inhibitors include, but are not limited to anacetrapib and evacetrapib. In addition to the aforementioned disease states, several other conditions or disorders can also benefit from treatment with the compositions described herein, such as for example; metabolic syndrome; macular degeneration (AREDS2 Research Group et. al.

Epub 2012 Sep. 6.). These conditions or disorders can be treated by administering the compositions described herein to a subject, typically a human, in need of such administration. Kits Packaged pharmaceutical kits are included herein. The kits comprise compositions described herein as unit dosage forms in a container and instructions for using the dosage form to treat a subject having a disease or disorder responsive to treatment by administration of the dosage forms comprising the compositions described herein. The packaged pharmaceutical kits provide prescribing information, over the counter medical use information, and/or nutritional information for the dosage form including, for example and without limitation, to a subject or health care provider, or as a label in a packaged pharmaceutical kit. Information included in the kit may include, for example and without limitation, efficacy, dosage and administration, contraindication and adverse reaction information pertaining to the Omega-3 fatty acid dosage form. The dosage and administration information, for example, can include dosing frequency as well as administration of the compositions with or without food. In certain embodiments the dosage forms comprising the compositions provided herein are in the form of liquid or capsules provided either as blister packages or in bottles together with over the counter medical use information and/or nutritional information. The packaged pharmaceutical kits can comprise one or more of the compositions described herein as the only active ingredient. In other embodiments, one or more of the compositions described herein can be packaged in combination with one or more active agents other than a non-Omega 3 ester, such as for example and without limitation, one or more other lipid lowering or cholesterol lowering agents selected from the group consisting of cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants/resins, statins, niacin and derivatives, MTP inhibitors, fibrates and CETP inhibitors. Dosage Forms Any of the compositions provided herein comprising at least one Omega-3 fatty acid ester can be provided as a pharmaceutical composition, a nutraceutical formulation, or a dietary supplement. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, carriers, preservatives, and/or coloring agents. General considerations in the composition and/or manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions may be found, for example, in Remington The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein can be formulated as a liquid for oral administration. Liquid compositions include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Examples of liquid pharmaceutical preparations include propylene glycol solutions and solutions containing sweeteners for oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. When the liquid composition comes into contact with an aqueous medium, such as for example an aqueous medium having an acidic environment, the composition forms micelles. In certain embodiments, the dosage form comprises micelles pre-formed prior to administration to a subject in need of such administration. Such pre-formed micelles are stable at room temperature. In other embodiments, the compositions described herein can be formulated as a fill material for a soft gelatin capsule. Likewise, when the contents of the soft gelatin capsule comes into contact with an aqueous medium, the composition forms micelles upon disintegration of the capsule. A capsule may be prepared, e.g., by placing the compositions described above inside a capsule shell. A capsule is a dosage form administered in a special container or enclosure containing an active agent. In some embodiments the compositions described herein can be filled into soft capsules. A capsule shell may be made of methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohols, or denatured gelatins or starch or other material. Hard shell capsules are typically made of blends of relatively high gel strength bone and pork skin gelatins. In some embodiments the unit dosage form is a gel capsule. In some embodiments the capsule shell is a glycerin capsule shell, for example product no. GSU0051 manufactured by SwissCaps and which meets USP 25 requirements (SwissCaps, USA 14193 SW 119th Ave., Miami/Fla., U.S. 33186). In other embodiments the capsule is a bovine gelatin shell, for example SwissCaps product no. GSU0708. Other suitable capsule shell materials include polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(methylmethacrylate), polyvinylchloride, polystyrene, polyurethanes, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylons, polyformaldehydes, polyesters, cellulose acetate, and nitrocellulose. The capsule shell itself may contain small amounts of dyes, opaquing agents, plasticizers, and preservatives. Conventional methods for preparing other solid dosage forms, for example, capsules, suppositories, and the like are also well known. Gelatin capsule shells may be made also be made of tapioca, grass, vegetable derived or fish derived gelatin. For example K-CAPS (Capsuline, Inc. Pompano Beach, Fla.) is a certified Kosher soft capsule shell of vegetable origin. Other vegetarian derived gelatin capsules may, be made of vegetable derived hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC). Capsules shells may also contain Modified Maize Starch, Glycerol, and Carrageenan as a gelling agent. In other embodiments the capsule has a shell comprising the material of the rate-limiting membrane, including coating materials, and filled with the compositions described herein. Capsule shells may be made of a porous or a pH-sensitive polymer made by a thermal forming process. In certain embodiments the capsule shell in the form of an asymmetric membrane; i.e., a membrane that has a thin skin on one surface and most of whose thickness is constituted of a highly permeable porous material. Yet another useful capsule, a “swelling plug device”, can be used. The compositions described herein can be incorporated into a non-dissolving capsule-half of the device which is sealed at one end by a hydrogel plug. This hydrogel plug swells in an aqueous environment, and, after swelling for a predetermined time, exits the capsule thus opening a port through which the active agent can leave the capsule and be delivered to the aqueous environment. Preferred hydrogel-plugged capsules are those which exhibit substantially no release of active agent from the dosage form until the dosage form has exited the stomach and has resided in the small intestine for about 15 minutes or more, preferably about 30 minutes or more, thus assuring that minimal Omega-3 fatty acid ester is released in the stomach or the small intestine. Hydrogel-plugged capsules of this type have been described in patent application WO90/19168. The dosage forms may contain a plasticizer, particularly in a capsule shell. Suitable plasticizers include, e.g., polyethylene glycols such as PEG 300, PEG 400, PEG 600, PEG 1450, PEG 3350, and PEG 800, stearic acid, propylene glycol, oleic acid, triethyl cellulose, triacetin, glycerin, sorbitol, sorbitan or combinations thereof. In additional embodiments, the compositions can be formulated as a liquid for parenteral administration. Compositions can be formulated as one or more dosage units. In some embodiments, it can be advantageous to formulate oral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit forms described in some embodiments can refer to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active composition calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the suitable pharmaceutical carrier. In certain embodiments, the dosage form may optionally contain a flavorant such as orange oil, substantially pure d-limonene, and an antioxidant such as tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate or a combination of antioxidants. Functional Foods In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein comprise micelles pre-formed prior to administration to a subject in need of such administration. Such pre-formed micelles are stable at room temperature. Accordingly, either such pre-formed micelles or the pre-micellized compositions described herein can be added to foods, which can then be consumed as part of a healthy diet for enriching a subject's Omega-3 fatty acid levels or as a dietary treatment in addition to the oral/parenteral administration of the compositions described herein as prescribed by a health professional. In certain embodiments, the functional food is in the form of edible or drinkable compositions, e.g., foodstuffs such as chewable or edible bars, confectionery products (e.g., chocolate bars), cookies, juice drinks, baked or simulated baked goods (e.g., brownies), biscuits, lozenges or chewing gum. Examples of chewable or edible bars include chocolate bars or energy bars. Such functional foods can be particularly useful to people participating in sports or other forms of exercise. In certain embodiments, the functional foods may also be in the form of, for example, butter, margarine, bread, cake, milk shakes, ice cream, yogurt and other fermented milk product. In certain embodiments, the functional food can also be in the form of a liquid to be sprayed on meats, salads or other foods. Other forms of the functional foods can be breakfast cereals, such as for example, grain flakes, muesli, bran, oatmeal. When the functional food product is in a drinkable form, the compositions described herein can be added directly to the drink, such as for example plain milk, flavored milk, fermented milk products or juices. The compositions will form micelles comprising the Omega-3 fatty acid esters in the drinkable product. When the functional food is in the form of a solid edible product, the compositions described herein can be first added to an aqueous medium, wherein the composition will form micelles as described herein. The aqueous medium comprising the micelles can subsequently be either sprayed onto the solid edible product or mixed into the ingredients when manufacturing the edible product. The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples, which are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to the materials and methods, may be practiced without departing from the purpose and interest of the invention. NON-LIMITING WORKING EXAMPLES Example 1 The amounts and percentages of the ingredients comprising the composition are shown in Table 1: TABLE 1 INGREDIENT Amount (mg) % (wt/wt) COMPOSITION (FILL MASS)/dosage form Total Omega-3 fatty acid 754.3 68.57 Ethyl Esters EPA Ethyl Esters 392.2 35.65 DHA Ethyl Esters 165.9 15.08 Polysorbate 80 337.9 30.72 Pluronic F87 7.8 0.71 GEL MASS/dosage form Gelatin 270 40 Glycerin 135 20 Purified water 270 40 The manufacturing process for the dosage form comprising one embodiment of the composition can be separated into three stages: a) the process for manufacturing the composition (fill mass), b) the process for manufacturing the gel mass used for encapsulating the fill mass, and c) the encapsulation process. Stages (a) and (b) can be carried out in either order. The process for manufacturing the composition begins by weighing appropriate amounts of the Polysorbate 80 and Pluronic F87 as per the desired batch size and mixing them to homogeneity at 60° C. in a stainless steel tank. This mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature before the substantially pure Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester mixture is vacuum-transferred quantitatively into the same stainless steel tank containing the Polysorbate 80 and Pluronic F87. This mixture is again mixed to homogeneity at room temperature before being blanketed with nitrogen. This final composition is also termed the “fill mass”. The process for manufacturing the gel mass begins by weighing appropriate amounts of each of the glycerin and water as per the desired batch size and mixing them to homogeneity in a separate stainless steel mixer at about 80° C. Next, the appropriate amount of gelatin is weighed as per the batch size, added to the glycerin/water mixture and again mixed to homogeneity at 80° C. before being degassed under vacuum. This final mixture comprising glycerin/water/gelatin is termed the “gel mass”. Depending on the desired shape of the capsule, suitable dies and transfer tubing are installed into a soft gel encapsulation apparatus (SS-60 Softgel Encapsulation Machine by SKY Softgel Co. Ltd., Incheon, Korea). The fill mass is pumped into the dies containing a pre-formed ribbon comprising the semi-solid gel mass. The dies shape the soft gelatin capsules, which are then tumble dried for about 20-60 min. The capsules are transferred onto a tray and dried in a low-temperature/humidity drying room and dried until the capsules reach above 75 shore hardness. The capsules are then inspected, sorted, polished, printed and packaged into bottles. The bottles are affixed with a label, which includes prescribing information. Alternatively, the bottles can be packaged into boxes with a package insert, which includes prescribing information. Example 2 Experiments were conducted to determine micelle formation in two compositions, A and B, as shown in Table 2. Both compositions were prepared as described in Example 1 comprising Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters, in which the Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters had increased absorption and the food effect was substantially eliminated. TABLE 2 % (wt/wt) Ingredients Composition A Composition B Omega-3 fatty acid Ethyl Esters 68.57 75.0 Polysorbate 80, NF 30.71 20.0 Pluronic F87 0.71 5.0 Combined surfactant HLB 15.3 16.8 Whole Product HLB 13 13.2 The compositions which formed well dispersed micelles generally had a combined surfactant HLB value of about 15 to about 17. Other compositions with Polysorbate 80 levels between 27-29% in combination with Pluronic F87 between about 7% to about 22% generally formed large oil globules. These compositions had a combined surfactant HLB value of from about 17 to about 19. Based on these experiments the whole product HLB was from about 13 and about 14.4 and the combined surfactant HLB was between about 12 to about 17. Example 3 Compositions A and B (1,000 mg), as shown in Table 2, were added to separate containers containing 500-900 mL of water in 0.1N HCl, under United States Pharmacopeia (USP) dissolution 2 conditions, as described in General Chapter 711, United States Pharmacopeia, 34/National/2011, and observed. Neither composition was subjected to any agitation or shearing. When observed under the microscope, very small, well dispersed micelles were visible. The micelles were stable for over twelve months at room temperature and there was no apparent separation of the Omega-3 fatty acid esters from the other ingredients of the composition. Thus, compositions that included Polysorbate 80 levels between 20-31% in combination with Pluronic F87 at 0.7 to 5% formed stable micelles. Example 4 A human subject ingested composition A in Example 2 (the “Experimental Composition”) and underwent blood monitoring to measure the increase in absorption of the Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters compared to the Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters in an Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester composition that is representative of currently marketed drug and nutritional Omega-3 products (the “Standard Composition”). The Standard Composition was manufactured by encapsulating Omega-3 ethyl esters using standard encapsulating methods. Absorption of Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters was determined by comparing changes in subject's OmegaIndex following ingestion of the compositions, as measured using the OmegaIndex test kit by OmegaQuant. Prior to ingestion of a composition, blood was drawn from the subject to determine subject's baseline OmegaIndex. The subject then ingested soft gel capsules containing either the Experimental Composition or the Standard Composition. A subsequent blood draw occurred at four hours post-ingestion. The subject remained in the fasted state from the initial baseline blood draw through the four-hour blood draw. The results are shown in Table 4.
