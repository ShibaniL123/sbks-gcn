Baked dough including a specific flour This invention relates to a baked dough, in particular a cereal dough, having a water activity greater than 0.6 and including at least a flour having a median particle size by volume smaller than or equal to 40 pm. Sugars are essential constituent in the development of food products, in particular baked pastry doughs. In addition to their sweetening properties, sugars play an important role in the texture and organoleptic properties of the food products to which they are added. However, excessive sugar in the blood can lead to cardiovascular disorders, obesity or diabetes. In addition, in the context of a balanced diet, nutritionists often recommend limiting the consumption of sugars. It is therefore beneficial, in order to improve the nutritional profiles of certain sweet foods such as baked doughs for pastry products, to minimize their sugar content. From this perspective, it has been envisaged, for example, to substitute sugars with lipids, i.e. fats. The food products thus obtained have organoleptic and textural properties similar to the sweet products that they are intended to replace, but their nutritional profile is substantially impaired by the introduction of these fats. Polyols have also been proposed as an alternative to sugars due to their sweetening activity and their ability to generate a lower glycemic response than sugars. However, to obtain gustatory and textural properties comparable to those obtained with sugars, the polyols must be introduced in a large amount, thus again impairing the nutritional benefit expected due to the replacement of the sugars. Moreover, the introduction of polyols in high amounts can lead to notable adverse effects on digestion, in particular laxative effects. Finally, another solution envisaged has been to replace sugars with cereals, in particular flour. However, the addition of flour in the doughs of soft products such as pastry products leads to an increase in the viscosity of the dough and impairs the proper development of the final product. In addition, the solutions proposed until now for replacing sugars in doughs involve unacceptable textural modifications, in particular increasing the viscosity of the dough and reducing the soft properties (in particular characterized by an airy, light and elastic structure) of the final product obtained. There is therefore a need for baked dough, in particular pastries, i.e. having a water activity greater than 0.6, and a reduced sugar content, while preserving the organoleptic and textural properties of sweet products. The inventors have shown that it was possible to solve the aforementioned problem by substituting sugars with a specific flour, in particular having a median particle size by volume smaller than or equal to 40 pm. In addition, this invention relates, according to a first aspect, to a baked dough having a water activity (Aw) greater than 0.6 and including at least one flour having a median particle size by volume smaller than or equal to 40 pm. In particular, according to one embodiment, the invention relates to a soft-textured baked dough having a water activity (Aw) between 0.6 and 0.80, the baked dough comprising a mixture of flour having a median particulate size in volume less than or equal to 40 pm and a sugar and/or sugar derivative, the flour excluding whole wheat flour in which the bran and the germ are not removed, and the flour having a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight, a protein content of 5% to 12%, and a fiber content less than or equal to 5% with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour content, and the sugar and/or sugar derivative content of the baked dough being between 15% and 25% by weight with respect to the total weight of the baked dough. The texture of the soft-textured baked dough can be measured by a test wherein a test sample obtained by cutting the soft-textured baked dough in the shape of a cylinder with a radius of 20 mm can be compressed by 25 percent with a compression force applied at a speed of 0.7 mm/sec by a penetrometer without the baked dough breaking when the force is applied. The invention also relates, according to a second aspect, to a food product including at least one baked dough as defined above. Also disclosed herein is the use of a flour having a median particle size by volume smaller than or equal to 40 pm in order to replace the sugars and/or sugar derivatives in the baked doughs or doughs intended to be baked. The invention also relates, according to another aspect, to a process of manufacturing baked dough comprising powdery components and liquid components, the process comprising the steps of: (a) mixing the dough constituents by (i) mixing the powdery components; (ii) subsequently adding the liquid components; and (b) forming the dough and oven baking the obtained formed backed dough, the improvement comprising substituting, in step (a) (i), at least a part of the sugars with a flour having a median particulate size in volume less than or equal to 40 pm, wherein the baked dough nutritional profile is improved. The process may optionally comprise a further step (a) (iii) of adding larger solid additional components, such as oat flakes, fruit drops, cereal crisps, after the addition of the liquid components. In addition, before the forming step (b), the dough may be left at rest between 15 min and 2h. The invention also relates, according to a further aspect, to a process of manufacturing baked dough comprising powdery components and liquid components, the process comprising the steps of: (a) mixing the dough constituents by (i) mixing the powdery components; (ii) subsequently adding the liquid components; and (b) forming the dough and oven baking the obtained formed backed dough, the improvement comprising substituting, in step (a) (i), at least a part of the sugars with a flour having a median particulate size in volume less than or equal to 40 pm, wherein the amount of calories in the baked dough is reduced.‚Äù The process may optionally comprise a further step (a) (iii) of adding larger solid additional components, such as oat flakes, fruit drops, cereal crisps, after the addition of the liquid components. In addition, before the forming step (b), the dough may be left at rest for 10 minutes to 2 hours. The powdery components include flour, powder sugar or solid sugar derivatives, salt, evaporated milk, cereals, dietary fibers, emulsifiers, powdery aromas and leavening agents such as baking soda. The liquid components include water, eggs, liquid sugar derivatives, fats, liquid aromas and colorants. The invention also relates to a method for preparing a soft-textured baked dough product comprising powdery and liquid components, the method comprising: mixing the powdery and liquid components to provide a dough, the powdery components comprising sugar and/or sugar derivative and a flour having a median particulate size in volume less than or equal to 40 pm, wherein said flour is a wheat flour in which bran and germ have been at least partially removed and has a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour content, and the flour having a fiber content less than or equal to 5% by weight and a protein content of 5 to 12% with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour content, the sugar and/or sugar derivative included in an amount of 15% and 25% by weight with respect to the total weight of the baked dough; and baking the dough to provide a soft-textured baked dough product, wherein the baked dough has a water content of 10% to 25%, and wherein a test sample obtained by cutting the soft-textured baked dough product in the shape of a cylinder with a radius of 20 mm can be compressed by 25 percent with a compression force applied at a speed of 0.7 mm/sec by a penetrometer without the baked dough product breaking when the force is applied. The invention also relates to a food product not including puff pastries, the food product including a soft-textured baked dough having a water activity (Aw) between 0.6 and 0.80, the baked dough comprising a mixture of a flour having a median particulate size in volume less than or equal to 40 pm and a sugar and/or sugar derivative, wherein said flour is a wheat flour in which bran and germ have been at least partially removed and has a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour content, and wherein the baked dough has a water content of 10% to 25%, a sugar and/or sugar derivative content between 15% and 25% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, and wherein the flour has a fiber content less than or equal to 5% by weight and a protein content of 5 to 12% with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour content, and wherein a test sample obtained by cutting the soft-textured baked dough in the shape of a cylinder with a radius of 20 mm can be compressed by 25 percent with a compression force applied at a speed of 0.7 mm/sec by a penetrometer without the baked dough breaking when the force is applied. The invention also relates to a method for decreasing the sugar content of a soft textured, non-laminated baked dough product, the method comprising substituting a portion of a sugar and/or sugar derivative content of a baked dough product with an amount of a wheat flour in which bran and germ have been at least partially removed, the wheat flour having a median particulate size in volume less than or equal to 40 pm, a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour content, a fiber content less than or equal to 5% by weight with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour content, and a protein content of 5 to 12% with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour content, the baked dough product comprising a mixture of the wheat flour and a sugar and/or sugar derivative, the sugar and/or sugar derivative included in an amount of 15% to 25% by weight with respect to the total weight of the baked dough as calculated after substitution with the amount of the wheat flour, the substituted amount of the wheat flour for the portion of the sugar and/or sugar derivative content effective to reduce the amount of calories in the baked dough product, and the baked dough product having a water content of 10% to 25% and a soft texture as determined by a test sample obtained by cutting the baked dough product in the shape of a cylinder with a radius of 20 mm and compressing by 25 percent with a compression force applied at a speed of 0.7 mm/sec by a penetrometer without the baked dough product breaking when the force is applied. Baked dough By "baked dough", we mean, in the sense of this application, a dough having been subjected to at least one baking step sufficient to enable partial gelatinisation of the starch that it contains. In its native, i.e. unbaked, state, starch has a semi-crystalline structure. After a heat treatment such as a baking step, optionally in the presence of water, the native semi-crystalline structure of the starch is at least partially modified. It is said that the starch is then at least partially gelatinised. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the starch present in the baked doughs according to this invention is at least partially, but not totally gelatinised. In other words, the starch present in the baked doughs according to this invention is at least partially gelatinised and at least partially non-gelatinised. The man of the art knows different techniques for recognizing Œ∑ŒøŒ∑gelatinized starch; the simplest being the observation under a polarized light microscope: non-gelatinized grains appear shaped as a "Maltese cross" (birefringence), whereas gelatinized grains lose this characteristic. The baking is performed according to practices and uses suitable for the desired finished product. For soft products, the baking is performed in an oven, generally at a temperature of 130 to 220¬∞C for 10 to 20 minutes. According to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention include at least flour and eggs. According to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention include at least flour, eggs and sugar. According to an even more preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention include at least flour, eggs, additional fats and sugar. The baked doughs according to the invention are preferably non-fermented, with the exception of baked doughs used in bakery products of which the soft texture is obtained by fermentation. Water activity (Awl The baked doughs according to the invention have a water activity between 0.6 and 0.80. The water activity is measured on the finished food products, i.e. after baking. According to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention have a water activity between 0.6 and 0.78, and preferably between 0.65 and 0.75. According to this invention, the baked doughs with an Aw below 0.6 are no longer considered to be soft products. This concerns in particular cookies or biscuits having textures and organoleptic properties very different from soft products. On the other hand, the baked doughs having an Aw above 0.80 are products having a limited shelf life, in particular less than 180 days. The water activity (Aw) of a material is defined as the ratio between the vapor pressure of the water of the material and the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature. This concept is well known to a person skilled in the art, who is perfectly aware of the suitable measurement methods. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention have a shelf life capable of reaching up to 180 days, and preferably up to 210 days. Water (moisture) The baked doughs according to the invention can preferably have a residual hydration corresponding to a water content in the finished product greater than 5% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the product, preferably between 5 and 25%, and more preferably between 10 and 25% by weight. Again, according to this application, baked doughs having a residual hydration corresponding to the water content in the finished product below 5% are no longer considered to be soft, but are qualified as dry biscuits. Pastry products The baked doughs according to the invention are very specifically used in pastry products, preferably non-fermented, with the exception of bakery products of which the soft texture is obtained by fermentation. In a non-limiting manner, the food products obtained from the baked doughs according to the invention can be cakes, partially or totally stuffed or coated, also capable of including items such as dried fruit, chocolate chips or fruit, or having decorative topping-type surface decorations. However, the food products obtained from the baked doughs according to the invention do not cover the laminated pastry such as puff pastry, which are well developed finished products, but do not have the soft texture of the products of the invention. Flour Wheat flour is the product developed from ordinary wheat grains, Triticum aestivum L. by milling or grinding methods in which the bran and the germ are partially removed and the remainder is reduced to a substantially fine powder. This excludes whole wheat flour obtained by milling or grinding methods in which the bran and the germ are not removed. Starch is a polysaccharide with the chemical formula (C6Hio05)n. ft consists of glucose molecules bound by Œ± (1-4) bonds. It consists of two polysaccharide fractions: - amylose, which constitutes around 25% of the starch, and which is formed by 600 to 1000 linear-chain glucose molecules; - amylopectin, which constitutes around 75% of the starch, and which is branched at about every 25 glucose radicals (alpha 1-6 bond). The starch grain is in the form of semi-crystalline granules. Granulometry is the study of the distribution of particle sizes of a flour. It is a basic characteristic, in direct relation with all of the grinding and separation unit operations. The median particle size corresponds to the equivalent diameter at which the value of the cumulative distribution is 50%. The flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention has a median particle size by volume smaller than or equal to 40 pm, i.e. in the sense of this application, more than 50% of the flour volume has a particle size smaller than or equal to 40 pm. According to a preferred embodiment, more than 80% of the flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention have a size smaller than or equal to 40 pm. The median particle size by volume is measured in particular by laser diffraction with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 apparatus combined with a SCIROCCO auto-sampler. The apparatus measures the volume occupied by each particle. As the particles are not strictly spherical, the apparatus approximates an equivalent sphere acting in the same manner as the particle considered. This is the most common laser diffraction particle size measurement. According to a preferred embodiment, the flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention has a median particle size by volume between 10 and 40 ŒºŒ∑Œê, i.e. in the sense of this application, more than 50% of the volume of the flour has a particle size between 10 and 40 ŒºœÑŒ∑. According to a more preferred embodiment, the flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention has a median particle size by volume between 15 and 40 ŒºŒêŒ∑, i.e. in the sense of this application, more than 50% of the volume of the flour has a particle size between 15 and 40 ŒºŒ∑Œê. According to a preferred embodiment, the flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention has a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight, with respect to the total weight of dry matter of flour, and preferably 3 to 5.5% by weight. The damaged starch content in the flour can in particular be detected by standardized methods such as the AACC 76-31 method. The "dry matter of flour" is defined as what is obtained when water is removed from the flour. In this application, the "dry matter of flour" represents at least 85% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the flour, and preferably 85 and 90% by weight. The damaged starch content is an important criterion in the assessment of the quality of a flour. It has indeed been observed that an excess of damaged starch results in significant water absorption, producing a sticky dough and, to a lesser extent, a low-volume finished product, with little development. Surprisingly, the use of flours according to the invention with a low damaged starch content enables good development of the finished product and a soft, low-density food to be obtained. When a soft, low-density finished product is obtained, its texture can be measured with a Tax-T2 penetrometer, by measuring the compression force recorded after 25% compression according to the following protocol: - Shaving the two sides of the soft biscuit (only if it is not flat) - Cutting a biscuit cylinder using a cookie cutter having a radius of 20 mm - The test piece thus obtained is then compressed with the Tax-T2 to 25% compression at a speed of 0.7 mm/sec. Soft textures for example do not include puff pastries, or any other laminated dougt, which usually develop well, but are not soft food products according to the present invention, as they break immediately when a penetration force is applied. According to a preferred embodiment, the flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention has a median particle size by volume smaller than or equal to 40 ŒºŒ∑Œê and a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour. According to a preferred embodiment, the flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention has a protein content less than or equal to 12% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour, preferably 5 to 12% by weight, and more preferably 6 to 8% by weight. Without wanting to be bound by any theory, it has been observed that the use of flour having an insufficient protein content, in particular less than 5% by weight with respect to the total weight of the flour, does not enable good development of the finished product, just as the use of a flour with an excessive protein content, in particular above 12% by weight with respect to the total weight of flour, does not at all enable a soft finished product to be developed. According to a preferred embodiment, the flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention has a fibre content less than or equal to 5% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the dry matter of flour, preferably 2 to 5% by weight, and more preferably 2.5 to 4.5% by weight. Without wanting to be bound by any theory, it has been observed that the use of flour having an excessive fiber content, in particular above 5% by weight with respect to the total weight of flour, limits the development of a soft finished product. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the flour used in the baked doughs according to the invention has a median particle size by volume less than or equal to 40 ŒºœÄŒê, a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight, with respect to the total weight of dry matter of flour, and a protein content less than or equal to 12% by weight, with respect to the total weight of dry matter of flour. Such flours can in particular be obtained by air classification methods. Air classification is a known method of dry fractionation of grains, enabling particles of various sizes to be obtained, pneumatically separated according to their higher or lower protein content or their particle size profile. Starch-rich particles, which are heavier and larger, are separated from protein particles, which are smaller. Aside from air classification, any other method enabling flours to be obtained with a median particle size by volume less than or equal to 40 pm, and preferably with a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight, with respect to the total weight of dry matter of flour, and a protein content less than or equal to 12% by weight, with respect to the total weight of dry matter of flour, can be used. The flours capable of being used in this invention can also be biscuit-baking flours or soft varieties of wheat flours, i.e. with a low hardness, such as North American wheat, ground so as to obtain the desired particle size distribution. However, in a preferred embodiment, the flours of the present invention are not whole-wheat flours obtained by milling or grinding methods in which the bran and the germ are not removed, and reduced in powder. Nutritional profile According to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention have a good nutritional profile, i.e. they include: - a low sugar content, in particular below 25% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, - a low saturated fat content, i.e. less than 5% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, - a high cereal content, i.e. more than 25% by weight, - advantageously, a high fiber content, i.e. more than 3% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough and preferably more than 6% by weight. In particular, the baked dough according to the invention can preferably include: - at least one flour having a median particle size by volume less than or equal to 40 pm, a damaged starch content less than or equal to 6% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the flour, and a protein content less than or equal to 12% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the flour, - less than 25% by weight of sugars and/or sugar derivatives, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, - less than 5% by weight of saturated fats, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, - more than 25% by weight of cereals, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, - advantageously, more than 3% by weight of fiber, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, and preferably more than 6% by weight. Sugars and sugar derivatives The baked doughs according to the invention preferably have a sugar and/or sugar derivative content less than or equal to 25% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough. The term sugar means, in the sense of this application, any monosaccharide such as, in particular, glucose, dextrose, fructose, galactose, mannose, or any disaccharide such as sucrose, lactose or maltose, conferring a sweet flavor on the food in which they are introduced. According to a preferred embodiment, the sugars introduced into the baked doughs according to the invention can be chosen in particular from sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose or any mixture of mono and disaccharide from inverted sugar, glucose syrup, honey or a mixture thereof. The sugars can also be introduced into the baked doughs according to the invention in the form of a fine crystallized sucrose powder (powdered sugar and in particular caster sugar). The sugar derivatives can also be present in the baked doughs according to the invention. Among the best-known sugar derivatives, it is possible to cite, for example, polyols such as maltilol, sorbitol or isomalt. These derivatives are commonly used as substitutes for classic sugars due to the fact that, although they have a sweetening power inferior to that of sugars, they have the advantage of not causing cavities, and induce a lower glycemic response than do sugars. According to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention include less than 25% by weight of sugars and/or sugar derivatives with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, preferably 15% to 25% by weight and most preferably 15 to 20 % by weight. According to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention include less than 10% by weight of polyols with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, preferably less than 8% by weight, and more preferably less than 6% by weight. Indeed, as indicated above, an excessive polyol content would cause adverse effects on digestion, and in particular laxative effects, which are unacceptable for the foods according to the invention. Fats The baked doughs according to the invention optionally include saturated or unsaturated fats. The term "fat" is used, in the sense of this application, as a synonym for the terms "lipid" or ‚Äúoils‚Äù. Fats are naturally present in numerous food constituents or products such as dairy products, cereal products and vegetables. Fats are comprised primarily of mixtures of triglycerides, which are saturated, monounsaturated or poly-unsaturated fatty acid esters. Saturated fatty acids, which do not contain a double bond, are present in particular in red meats and dairy products, but also in oils and refined foods in variable proportions. Cis monounsaturated fatty acids are present in olive oil and olives, rapeseed oil, peanut oil and peanuts, mustard, chicken, eggs, fish, and oleaginous fruits (cashews and macadamia nuts). Cis polyunsaturated fatty acids are present in certain oils (rapeseed, soybean, safflower, wheat germ oil), fish, certain oleaginous fruits and cereals. Trans fatty acids result from partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fats and are easily oxidizable. Omega-3 and omega-6 are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are classified as essential fatty acids. They are essential because the human body cannot synthesize them. The omega-3 fatty acid group, in also denoted œâ3, is present in large amounts in certain fatty fishes, flax, nuts, rapeseed and false flax. According to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention include less than 5% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, of saturated fats. According to another preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention should not include more than 1% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, of tram fatty acids. According to an even more preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention include a content ranging from 0.1 to 1% by weight of omega-3 fatty acids, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough. Cereals The baked doughs according to the invention can also include cereals. Cereals provide the largest portion (around 45%) of the recommended daily intake of calories for people, and are also an important source of proteins. The cereals can be chosen in particular from rice, com, wheat, barley, oat, quinoa, rye, spelt and mixtures thereof. Whole grains are an important source of fiber, essential fatty acids and other indispensible nutrients. Whole grains are not peeled from their external layer, which is called the pericarp or bran. The most common whole grains include wheat, oat and brown rice. To have a good nutritional profile, the baked doughs according to the present invention can preferably include a cereal content greater than or equal to 25% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, and preferably 25 to 40% by weight. Dietary fibers Dietary fibers are fractions of plant origin that remain non degraded by digestive enzymes. However, they are essential for proper functioning of intestinal transit. Dietary fibers are spread among two main categories, depending on whether or not they are soluble in water. They are found in plant foods, fruits, vegetables and cereals, in particular. Dried fruits, prunes and dried apricots are particularly rich sources. The baked doughs according to the invention can include viscous water-soluble fibers, non-viscous water-soluble fibers and/or water-insoluble fibers, or a mixture thereof. According to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention include a mixture of water-soluble fibers and/or water-insoluble fibers. The insoluble fibers swell in water and enable, owing to their water absorption capacity, the volume of the alimentary bolus to be increased. Insoluble fiber sources include in particular whole wheat, oats, barley, rye, rice, com and preferably the bran of these cereals as well as fruits (such as apples, lemons, prunes, mangos, figs, etc.) or vegetables (such as tomatoes, carrots, celery, etc.) or cocoa beans. Water-soluble fibers generating little to no increase in the viscosity of water when they are solubilized are called non-viscous soluble fibers. Non- viscous soluble fibers can in particular have an average molar mass (or molecular weight) less than 3.104 g/mol and are in particular fructo-oligosaccharides, galacto-oligosaccharides, xylo-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, polydextrose, dextrins, cyclodextrins, or they can have a higher molar weight when they are highly branched and have a more compact size (and therefore a lower hydrodynamic volume), such as arabic gum. Alternatively, other water-soluble fibers have the property of increasing the viscosity of water when they are solubilized in it, and are called viscous soluble fibers. However, according to a preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to this invention include less than 5% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, of viscous fibers, preferably less than 3% by weight, and more preferably less than 1% by weight. In particular, according to an especially preferred embodiment, the baked doughs according to this invention are free of viscous fibers. The viscous soluble fibers can, for example, be chosen from guar, other galactomannans (carob gum, tara gum, fenugreek), glucomannans or konjac flour, xanthan gum, alginates, pectins, oat or barley B-glucans, wheat arabinoxylans, and chemically modified celluloses having a molar mass between 3.105 and 3.106 g/mol, and preferably between 5.105 g/mol and 2.106 g/mol. In particular, the baked doughs according to the invention include 1% to 7% by weight of fiber, with respect to the total weight of the baked dough, and preferably 3% to 6% by weight. Salt According to a particular embodiment, the baked doughs according to the invention having a good nutritional profile include less than 500 mg of sodium for 100 g of baked dough, and preferably less than 400 mg of sodium for 100 g. Additional ingredients In addition to the ingredients described above, the baked doughs according to the invention can include additional ingredients commonly used in food, such as milk, eggs, emulsifiers, baking powders (such as ammonium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium pyrophosphate, etc.), food colours and mixtures thereof. This invention is described in greater detail in the following examples.

It was observed that the replacement of sugars with classic flours (Comparative examples 1 and 3) produced doughs having a higher viscosity than the dough according to the invention (example 2) obtained by replacing sugars with an air-classified flour. The textures of the baked doughs obtained were also compared by measuring, with the Tax-T2 penetrometer, the compression force recorded after 25% compression according to the following protocol: - Shaving the two sides of the soft biscuit (only if it is not flat) - Cutting a biscuit cylinder using a cookie cutter having a radius of 20 mm - The test piece thus obtained is then compressed with the Tax-T2 to 25% compression at a speed of 0.7 mm/sec. It was observed that, for a set compression ratio below 25%, the compression force that had to be applied on the comparative compositions of examples 1 and 3 in which the sugars were replaced by flours having a median particle size distribution by volume greater than 40 ŒºœÑŒ∑ was greater than the compression force that had to be applied on the product according to example 2 of the invention. Therefore, the product according to the invention has a softer texture than the products obtained from comparative compositions 1 and 3. Finally, the density and thickness were compared in the products obtained from the compositions of examples 1 to 3: Example 1 (Comparative) Example 2 (Invention) Example 3 (Comparative) Thickness 28.6 34.5 32.7 (in mm) Density 0.255 0.202 0.266 The product of example 2 according to the invention has a greater thickness than the other products, which means better development of the finished product. Moreover, its density is substantially lower than that of the products obtained from other compositions, indicating a lighter texture of the finished product, and again, a more developed finished product.
