BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure is directed to sleep systems and, more particularly, to mattresses and bedding for infants and toddlers to be used in crib and cradle safety sleep systems. 2. Description of the Related Art Cribs and cradles are utilized by infants or young children during sleep and nap times as well as for resting while awake. A typical crib has a base, a soft mattress resting on the base, and side rails surrounding the mattress to keep an infant from falling off the mattress. One or both side rails have top and bottom rails with vertical slats extending there between. These side rails are usually configured to raise and lower to facilitate placing and removing a child from the crib and changing the bedding and, at times, the mattress. However, the side rails of a crib can often pose dangers for young children, such as hitting their heads on the hard surface or getting limbs stuck between individual vertical slats. As a result of these dangers, crib bumpers have become popular to act as a buffer between a child and the side rails. Many people find crib bumpers necessary for one of three reasons: to protect a child from the hard surfaces of the crib or cradle, to prevent a child's limbs from extending through the slats resulting in strain or injury, or to simply provide an environment in which a child can have a more restful sleep. Traditional crib and cradle bumpers create a “wall” that lines the inside perimeter of the bed. These bumpers block the child's access to the vertical slats and the space in between each vertical slat. Unfortunately, these bumpers can also block airflow to the child, especially young infants who can be smothered or tangled in the flexible ties used to hold the bumper to the side rails and end boards of the crib. This style of crib bumper has generally been made of a continuous, soft, quilted pad that is fastened to the vertical rails of the crib by ties similar to shoe laces. There are a number of reasons why this is not safe for a child. First, the pad does not allow for proper airflow to the child and a child can suffocate if their airway is blocked by the soft pad (at a young age, children do not have the instinct to move away when their airway is blocked). Second, because the pads are secured to the railings instead of the mattress by the ties, children can get their faces or limbs wedged between the bumper and the mattress causing injury or suffocation. Finally, these pads are typically secured to the rails with some type of fastener, generally ties, that do not hold the bumper tightly to the rails and slats, which can pose a strangulation or choking hazard for children. There are also new types of “wall” bumpers made of mesh. These do allow for airflow while keeping a child's limbs from becoming stuck in the side rails, but they do not provide any protection from the hard surfaces of the rails or crib. This could result in injury to the child or, at minimum, could wake a child if they bump too hard into the sides of the crib or cradle. One example of a mesh bumper can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 8,161,584, which uses a mesh means at the base of the bumper where the bumper meets the mattress. Additionally, this system uses a fastening device to attach the mesh to the fitted sheet. This can either be in direct contact with a child, possibly resulting in injury, or be can lead to the child being covered with a “flap,” leading to suffocation. Another solution has been to wrap each vertical slat individually. One example of such a bumper can be seen in published Patent Application WO 2009117180. Although this method provides protection from the hard, internal surfaces of the crib and allows for airflow, it does not prevent a child's limbs from extending through the vertical rails. This could cause injury or allow a child to wake from restful sleep when turning or changing positions in the crib or cradle. One other proposed solution can be seen in U.S. Pat. No. 7,774,874, which uses triangular bumpers around the inside perimeter of the crib or cradle. However, this design still poses several potential safety hazards. A child can easily get caught underneath the device because it rests directly on top of the mattress without being secured to the mattress in any way. If a child accidentally places their head or limbs under the bumpers, they could suffocate or sustain injuries. In addition, the bumper is attached via cords, snaps or some kind of tie to the rails of the bed, which present a significant choking or strangulation hazard to children. Accordingly, there is a need for a protective system for cribs, cradles and toddler beds that does not pose any significant hazards or dangers to a child, and keeps the child centered in the safe middle section of the bed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various disclosed implementations. However, one skilled in the relevant art will recognize that the present disclosed implementations may be practiced without one or more of these specific details or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures or components or both that are associated with the environment of the present disclosure, including but not limited to the construction of the crib frame, bed frame, and mattresses have not been shown or described in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring descriptions of the implementations. Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout the specification and claims that follow, the word “comprise” and variations thereof, such as “comprises” and “comprising” are to be construed in an open inclusive sense, that is, as “including, but not limited to.” The foregoing applies equally to the words “including” and “having.” Reference throughout this description to “one implementation” or “an implementation” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the implementation is included in at least one implementation. Thus, the appearance of the phrases “in one implementation” or “in an implementation” in various places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same implementation. FIG. 1 shows a bedding assembly 20 according to one implementation of the present disclosure. The bedding assembly 20 includes a first side 22, a second side 24, a third side 26, a fourth side 28, and a center 30. The sides 22, 24, 26 and 28 are generally sloped upwards and outwards from the center 30. An infant is placed on the center 30 to sleep, and the sides 22, 24, 26 and 28 help to keep the infant positioned in the center 30 of the bedding system 20 and prevent them from falling off while sleeping. The bedding assembly 20 is designed to keep a child within the safety of the center 30 of a crib or cradle without any devices or parts that a child can get wedged under, become tangled in, or choke on. It is to be understood that the bedding assembly 20 can be formed to be with a mattress 100 (shown in FIG. 8) or mattress-boxspring combination or formed separate from the mattress 100. The system may also include the frame or crib that supports the mattress. FIG. 2 shows a further aspect of the bedding assembly 20 to include a first padding 32, a second padding 34, a third padding 36 and a fourth padding 38. It is to be appreciated that the individual padding sections 32, 34, 36, 38 can be connected together to form a unitary elongate padding or a padding formed in a geometric shape, such as the traditional rectangular shape of a mattress. As such it can be easily placed around the perimeter of a mattress top on which it is used. However, in a preferred implementation, the padding is formed of the four sections 32, 34, 36 and 38 that are placed or formed in the sides 22, 24, 26 and 28 of the bedding assembly or system, thus providing a supporting structure for the sides. The contoured shape of the padding allows for easy airflow to the child, and prevents the sides 22, 24, 26 and 28 from collapsing on the child, which can lead to suffocation. In another contemplated implementation of the present disclosure, the bedding system 20 only has two sides 22 and 26. In this implementation, the bedding system 20 positions paddings 32 and 36 on the top surface of the mattress 100, but does not have the paddings 34 and 38 adjacent to the headboard or footboard of the crib or cradle. The padding 32, 34, 36, 38 is made of any suitable soft, protective material, such as foam. Preferably, the padding 32, 34, 36, 38 is made of food grade polyethylene in order to be less toxic and easily wiped clean. Food grade polyethylene does not produce trapped gasses like other foam products do, which may be dangerous to a child. Each of the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38 has a bottom surface 40, a back surface 42, an angled surface 44 connecting the bottom surface 40 and the back surface 42, and first and second side surfaces 46 and 48. Each padding 32, 34, 36 and 38 preferably has a triangular cross sectional configuration, as shown in FIG. 4. The angle between the bottom surface 40 and the angled surface 44 can be any angle sufficient to keep a child away from the railing, while still allowing adequate airflow to the child. Preferably, the angle is between 20 degrees and 70 degrees. The triangular shape of the paddings helps to ensure that there are no gaps or air pockets which a child might become stuck in, while still allowing air to easily flow into the crib. The padding length from the first side surface 46 to the second side surface 48 can be any length appropriate to fit in a crib, cradle or toddler bed. Preferably, the length from side surface 46 to side surface 48 of paddings 32 and 36 is between 45″ and 80″; and the length from side surface 46 to side surface 48 of paddings 34 and 38 is between 25″ and 45″. The width of the bottom surface 40, as measured from the back surface 42 to the angled surface 48, can be any length appropriate to keep a child safely secured in the center of the bedding assembly 20. Preferably, the width of the bottom surface 40 is between 4″ and 6″. The height of the back surface 42 can be any length appropriate to protect an infant or child from hitting the side rails of a crib or cradle or from falling out of a bed. Preferably, the height of the back surface 42 is between 3″ and 6″. FIG. 3 shows the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38 fitting together to form a rectangular shape having approximately the same outer perimeter dimensions as the top of the mattress with which the bedding assembly 20 will be used. As shown in FIG. 1, the bottom surface 40 of all paddings 32, 34, 36, 38 is placed downward, with the back surface 42 being vertical and the angled surface 44 angled inwardly toward the center of the crib. The side surface 46 of each padding 32, 34, 36, and 38 touches the side surface 48 of one other padding. FIG. 4 is a side view of one of the paddings 32, 34, 36, 38, showing the face of the side surface 48, and a profile view of the padding. FIGS. 5 and 6 show a cover 50 of the bedding assembly 20. The paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38 are contained within the cover 50, which securely fastens all paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38 together. The cover 50 provides a single, continuous surface 62 for the entire bedding assembly 20, preventing a child from becoming trapped under the paddings. The cover 50 is made up of a center piece 52, a first padding wrap 54, a second padding wrap 56, a third padding wrap 58 and a fourth padding wrap 60. Each of the padding wraps 54, 56, 58 and 60 are connected to the center piece 52 so that the padding wraps and the center piece 52 have a single, continuous top surface 62 when the cover 50 is fastened around the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38. The padding wraps 54, 56, 58 and 60 each have a padding covering portion 66 extending from the center piece 52, and a side covering portion 68 extending from the padding covering portion. The padding wraps 54, 56, 58, and 60 contain fasteners 64 that are used to secure the padding wraps around their respective paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38. Preferably, the fasteners 64 are connected to the side cover portion 68 in order to keep the fasteners 64 on the outside of the system 20 and away from the child. According to one implementation, the padding wraps 54, 56, 58 and 60 fully enclose their respective paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38. In another implementation, the padding wraps 54, 56, 58 and 60 partially enclose the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38, leaving the bottom surface 40 of each padding uncovered. The fasteners 64 of the cover are preferably hook and loop fasteners, or any other suitable releasable fastener, and are positioned on all four sides of the cover. Preferably, there are eight sets of hook and loop fasteners stitched to the perimeter of the cover measuring approximately 1″×1.5″ each. Other fasteners may include snaps or zippers, but will preferably face the railing so nothing hard can be felt while lying on the bedding system. The cover 50 can be made of any suitable fabric to securely wrap the paddings, such as cotton. According to one implementation, the cover is made of 100% organic cotton. The weight of the fabric is preferably thick and durable enough to contain the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38 and keep them in place, giving the bedding assembly 20 structure. Preferably the fabric used for the cover does not stretch, thereby giving more support to the bedding assembly 20. The cover 50 is sewn such that the padding wraps 54, 56, 58 and 60 fit tightly over the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38 when they are wrapped around the paddings, preventing the paddings from slipping or moving. According to one implementation, the cover also protects the mattress from spills and stains by placing a rubber layer on the center piece 52. This is an added convenience for the consumer, as a separate mattress pad or protector does not have to be purchased. The cover 50 can be easily removed for laundering. FIGS. 7-10 show another implementation of the bedding assembly 20 described above used in conjunction with a fitted sheet 70. The fitted sheet 70 is sized and shaped to at least fit over and preferably enclose or encompass the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38, the cover 50, and the mattress 100 on which the bedding assembly 20 rests. The fitted sheet 70 includes a padding covering portion 72 and a mattress covering portion 74. The padding covering portion 72 of the fitted sheet 70 is sized and shaped to fit over the center 30 and over the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38. The padding covering portion 72 is sewn such that it has a center portion 82 that lies over the top surface 102 of the mattress 100, and a perimeter portion 84 that circumscribes the center portion 82 and fits over the paddings 32, 34, 36 and 38. The mattress covering portion 74 of the fitted sheet 70 extends from the padding covering portion to cover a sidewall 104 and a bottom surface 106 of the mattress 100. The mattress covering portion 74 has a first sheet part 76 that covers the sidewall 104 of the mattress 100, and a second sheet part 78 extending inwardly from the first part 76 to enclose at least part of the bottom surface 106 of the mattress, forming an opening 86 on the fitted sheet 70. The fitted sheet 70 keeps the sleeping environment clean and clear of any internal parts that a child could potentially be entangled in, causing strangulation or suffocation. The opening 86 for removing the fitted sheet 70 is completely under the mattress and out of reach of the child. The sheet 70 is kept secure by elastic stitched in the opening 86 or any other suitable method. In one implementation, the sheet is made of 100% organic cotton, however any suitable fabric may be used. The fitted sheet 70 has a fabric that is preferably smooth and soft in surface texture making it a comfortable sleeping surface. FIGS. 11-13 show the bedding assembly 20 being used on a variety of different bed types, allowing the bedding assembly 20 to be used when a child is transitioning into larger bed by sleeping in a convertible crib or toddler bed. As long as a standard mattress is used in the bed, the fitted sheet 70 will securely fasten the bedding assembly 20 to the mattress even when no railing or other side guards are used. When used in a toddler bed or a convertible crib, the bedding assembly 20 will help to prevent a child from rolling out of bed. This lengthens the time and use of the implementation making it multi-functional and a more convenient purchase for the consumer. The various implementations described above can be combined to provide further implementations. All of the U.S. patents, U.S. patent application publications, U.S. patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent applications and non-patent publications referred to in this specification and/or listed in the Application Data Sheet are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety. Aspects of the implementations can be modified, if necessary to employ concepts of the various patents, applications and publications to provide yet further implementations. These and other changes can be made to the implementations in light of the above-detailed description.
