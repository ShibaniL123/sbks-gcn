FIELD OF THE INVENTION The subject matter of the present disclosure relates generally to a light fixture, and more particularly, to a light fixture having multiple light sources arranged in a linear or substantially linear manner. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The illumination of items placed on a shelf or series of shelves presents certain challenges. Depending on the location of the light source, one shelf may block light from illuminating another shelf. Similarly, if a light is placed to one side, large items closest to the light may block light from illuminating other items on the same shelf. Aesthetics can also be a concern particularly when attempting to optimize the positioning of the light source to address the above-mentioned illumination issues. For example, in a commercial setting where the items being displayed are e.g., consumer products, it is desirable to properly illuminate the consumer products without blocking the consumer's view or detracting from the presentation of the products. Additionally, variables such as the color and intensity of the lighting can be particularly important. The use of light sources such as light emitting diodes, halogen bulbs, and others can present additional issues. For example, certain types of light sources can generate significant amounts of heat. This heat must be properly dissipated to e.g., avoid damaging the light fixture or improperly heating surfaces near the light fixture. If the application involves an environment where moisture may be present, such as e.g., a refrigerated display case, it may also be necessary to protect the light sources and/or associated electronics from exposure to such moisture. Accordingly, a light fixture that can provide light from a linear source—i.e. a source where one or more light sources are aligned substantially along a longitudinal direction—would be particularly useful for certain applications. For example, such an arrangement could be used to provide lighting for items placed along a shelf or series of shelves. Such a light fixture that can also be used to provide e.g., the desired color and intensity of light would also be beneficial. Additionally, such a light fixture that can also be provided with features for varying the direction of the light would also be useful. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a light fixture that includes a plurality of light emitting sources, such as e.g., LEDs, which may be arranged along a longitudinal direction. At least one heat sink provides a support structure for the light emitting sources while also assisting with the dissipation of heat. A diffuser covers the light emitting sources and is also supported by the heat sink. One or more optical elements such as e.g., a reflector or internally reflecting lens, may be used to help direct light rays from the light emitting sources. Certain features may be added at the ends of the light fixture for mounting upon a surface and/or for further controlling the direction of light rays projecting from the light fixture. The light fixture may be suitable for a variety of applications including e.g., the illumination of products displayed on shelving for consumer viewing. Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be apparent from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention. In one exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a light fixture that includes at least one heat sink defining a longitudinal direction. At least one circuit board is attached to the heat sink. A plurality of light emitting sources are mounted to the at least one circuit board. The light emitting sources are spaced apart from each other and may be arranged along the longitudinal direction. A diffuser extends along the longitudinal direction and is attached to the heat sink. The diffuser covers the light emitting sources. These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. FIGS. 1 and 2 provide a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of a light fixture 100 of the present invention. A diffuser 102 is shown in position in FIG. 1 while in FIG. 2 diffuser 102 has been removed to reveal other components. FIG. 3 provides close-up view of a first end 104 of fixture 100. Light fixture 100 includes a heat sink 112 that extends along longitudinal direction L between first end 104 and a second end 106. Each end 104 and 106 includes a bracket 108 and 110, respectively. Brackets 108 and 110 may be used to mount fixture 100 to a surface. Apertures 114 in each bracket 108 and 110 may be used along with fasteners for such mounting. Other features may be used for mounting light fixture 100 as well. By way of example, light fixture 100 could be mounted at the top and/or bottom of a refrigerated display case and used to illuminate products on shelves in the case. Light fixture 100 may be used in other applications as well. Fixture 100 includes a plurality of light emitting sources 116 spaced apart from each other and arranged along longitudinal direction L as shown. Each light emitting sources 116 may be e.g., one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs). The density and number of LEDs along longitudinal direction L can be determined based on e.g., the application intended for fixture 100. As shown in FIG. 2, light emitting sources 116 are positioned in a straight-line manner along the longitudinal direction. However, it should be understood that it is within the scope of the present invention for light sources 116 to be arranged in other manners, e.g., arranged longitudinally but not necessarily along a straight-line as shown in FIG. 2, or arranged laterally. For this exemplary embodiment, a reflector 118 is provided that also extends along longitudinal direction L. Reflector 118 defines a plurality of cavities (or recesses) 120 that are also spaced apart and positioned along longitudinal direction L. More particularly, each cavity 120 is positioned around or otherwise contains at least one of the light emitting sources 116 and includes one or more light reflecting surfaces 122 and 124 for reflecting light away from light fixture 100. By way of example, reflector 118 could be constructed from a metallized plastic so as to provide light reflective surfaces 122 and 124. Light reflected from surfaces 122 and 124 passes through diffuser 102. For this exemplary embodiment, diffuser 102 is constructed from a material of uniform thickness that helps control e.g., the color and/or distribution of the light. FIG. 4 provides cross-sectional view of first end 104 while FIG. 5 provides a perspective view of first end 104 with a cap 134 in place. Reflector 118 is mounted to a circuit board such as e.g., a fiberglass reinforced printed circuit board 126. Reflector 118 can be attached using e.g., fasteners 132. Other fastening mechanisms may also be used. For example, reflector 118 could be manufactured with pegs that provide an interference fit with holes or openings in circuit board 126. Circuit board 126 also extends along longitudinal direction L and is attached to heat sink 112. By way of example, circuit board 126 could be provided with fasteners or pegs that extend into a slot 128 provided by heat sink 112 and positioned at the bottom of circuit board 126. Heat sink 112 is constructed from one or materials that help dissipate heat created by light emitting sources 116. Heat sink 112 also provides the structure or frame for light fixture 100. By way of example, heat sink 112 could be constructed from anodized aluminum. For this exemplary embodiment, heat sink 112 is configured to resist collecting dirt and debris, to be readily cleanable by e.g., wiping, and still have substantial surface area for convective cooling. Ends 104 and 106 each include apertures 130 that are oriented along longitudinal direction L. Apertures 130 are configured for the receipt of fasteners 132 that extend through apertures 143 (FIG. 6) in cap 134 to secure cap 134 onto end 104. As shown in FIG. 5, cap 134 includes a peg 136 that extends along longitudinal direction L. Peg 136 is rotatably received into an aperture 140 defined by bracket 108 as shown in FIG. 6. A similar construction is used for a cap (not shown) positioned on second end 106 with bracket 110. As such, after mounting brackets 108 and 110, light fixture 100 can be rotated in the direction desired as the pegs at first end 104 and 106 rotate within brackets 108 and 110. A fastener such as a set screw can be inserted into aperture 138 (FIG. 3) to apply force against peg 136 and fix the rotational position of light fixture 100. A metal insert can be provided that is either heat-staked, ultra-sonically welded, or molded-in to allow such set screw or thumb screw. Returning to FIG. 4, an exemplary technique for mounting diffuser 102 to heat sink 112 is shown. Heat sink 112 includes a pair of grooves 150 and 152 positioned on opposite sides of reflector 118 and the plurality of light emitting sources 116. Grooves 150 and 152 extend along longitudinal direction L. Diffuser 102 may include a pair of opposing longitudinal edges 154 and 156 that are received in a complementary manner into grooves 150 and 152. Diffuser 102 provides a spring-like force that urges edges 154 and 156 into grooves 150 and 152 to secure the attachment of diffuser 102. FIG. 7 illustrates another exemplary technique for mounting diffuser 102 to heat sink 112. More specifically, for the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 7, heat sink 112 includes a pair of ribs 142 and 144 positioned on opposite sides and extending along longitudinal direction L. Ribs 142 and 144 project outwardly or face away from each other as well as light emitting sources 116. Diffuser 102 includes a pair of grooves 146 and 148 positioned on opposite sides of diffuser 102 and also extending along longitudinal direction L. As shown, ribs 142 and 144 are received in a complementary manner into grooves 146 and 148, respectively, to secure diffuser 102 into position. FIG. 8 provides a close up of a cavity 120 at first end 104 of light fixture 100. Cavity 120 includes a first pair of light reflective surfaces 122 positioned in an opposing manner about light emitting source 116. Cavity 120 also includes a second pair of light reflective surfaces 124 positioned in an opposing manner along with the first pair of light reflective surfaces 122 about light emitting source 116. FIG. 9 provides a cross-sectional view of light fixture 100 taken along a plane parallel to circuit board 126 and at a position above light emitting source 116. As shown, the first pair of light reflective surfaces 122 having a first parabolic shape, while the second pair of light reflective surfaces 124 have a second parabolic shape different than the first parabolic shape. The shapes of surfaces 122 and 124 are configured as such to help direct light rays emitted from source 116. In other exemplary embodiments of light fixture 100, other shapes may be used for surfaces 122 and 124 in addition to that which is shown including e.g., non-parabolic shapes. FIG. 10 illustrates an end view of another exemplary embodiment of a light fixture 100 of the present invention (mounting features have been removed for purposes of illustrating interior components). Unlike the previously described embodiments, the light fixture 100 shown in FIG. 10 does not include a reflector. In addition, FIG. 10 illustrates another exemplary technique for mounting diffuser 102 to heat sink 112. More specifically, for the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 7, heat sink 112 includes a pair of ribs 158 and 160 positioned on opposite sides and extending along longitudinal direction L. Ribs 158 and 160 project inwardly or face towards each other as well as light emitting sources 116. Diffuser 102 includes a pair of grooves 162 and 164 positioned on opposite sides of diffuser 102 and also extending along longitudinal direction L. As shown, ribs 158 and 160 are received in a complementary manner into grooves 162 and 164, respectively, to secure diffuser 102 into position. FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional, end view of another exemplary light fixture 100 of the present invention. Unlike previous embodiments, the embodiment of FIG. 11 includes an optical element or lens 166. Referring now to FIGS. 11, 12, and 13, lens 166 extends along longitudinal direction L and is positioned directly over the plurality of light emitting sources 116, which are received into a channel 176 defined by the inside surface 178 of lens 166. By way of example, lens 166 is provided with a pair of projecting inserts 168 and 170 that are received into circuit board 126 to secure lens 166 using an interference fit. Other features may be used to secure lens 166 as well. Lens 166 includes a pair of internally reflecting surfaces 172 and 174. For this exemplary embodiment, surfaces 172 and 174 may be arcuate in shape (and each may provide an external surface that is convex) within a plane that is orthogonal to longitudinal direction L as shown in FIG. 12. As such, some of the light rays from light sources 116 will enter lens 166 through inside surface 178, reflect off of surfaces 172 and 174, and exit lens 166 through outer surface 180. Other shapes for surfaces 172, 174, 178, and 180 may also be used in an effort to direct light rays from light emitting sources 116 away from light fixture 100. By way of example, lens 166 can be manufactured from a polycarbonate or an acrylic material. Lens 166 may be constructed in a variety of lengths to cover one or several light emitting sources 116. Light fixture 100 can be constructed in a modular manner to help simplify manufacture. For example, referring to FIG. 2, a series of modules 182 can be installed on a heat sink 112 that is cut to the desired length. For example, heat sink 112 may be cut to a length of four feet to accept four modules 182, each constructed at a one foot length. In turn, each module 182 could individually include e.g., a reflector 118 or lens 166, circuit board 126, and one or more light emitting sources 116. Modules 182 can be connected electrically using e.g., connector 184 with wire slots 188 (FIG. 7), mating pin connections 186 (FIG. 9), or other connection mechanisms positioned at the ends of modules 182. It should be understood that for each exemplary embodiment, diffuser 102 may be constructed with a non-uniform shape and thickness so as to assist in directing light where desired. Additionally, the shape of e.g., diffuser 102 and either reflector 118 or lens 166 can be used together to minimize color separation. For example, lens 166 can be used to focus the light to increase flux density on the target plane while the diffuser 102 can un-focus the light slightly to remove color separation issues.
