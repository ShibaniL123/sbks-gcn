CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of PCT/EP2012/065172,filed on Aug. 2, 2012, which claims priority from EP 11176732.3, filled on Aug. 5, 2011. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a single-site catalyst suitable for the preparation of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). The invention further relates to a process for preparing said UHMWPE, to the UHMWPE obtained from said process the use of said UHMWPE in various applications e.g. biomedical devices, ballistic protection, fishing and sailing ropes. BACKGROUND UHMWPE has a molecular weight of at least 1,000,000 Da, which is 10 to 100 times greater than the molecular weight of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). UHMWPE offers major advantages in increased impact resistance, tensile strength, abrasion resistance, and stress-crack resistance. UHMWPE can be produced by Ziegler polymerization. The process requires exceptionally pure ethylene and other raw materials. Like conventional HDPE, UHMWPE made by Ziegler polymerization has a broad molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn (Mw is the weight average molecular weight, Mn is the number average molecular weight) of within the range of 5 to 20. However, UHMWPE with a narrow molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn of less than 5 have improved mechanical properties. Newly developed metallocene and single-site catalysts advantageously provide polyethylene and other polyolefins with very narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn from 1 to 5). The narrow molecular weight distribution results in reduced low molecular weight species and higher Mn which further improves abrasion resistance. These new catalysts also significantly enhance incorporation of long-chain α-olefin comonomers into polyethylene, and therefore reduce its density. Unfortunately, however, these catalysts produce polyethylene having a lower molecular weight than that made with Ziegler-Natta catalysts. It is extremely difficult to produce UHMWPE with conventional metallocene or single-site catalysts. However, some allege to have obtained UHMWPE with various single-site catalysts. U.S. Pat. No. 7,951,743 discloses an ultra-high molecular weight, linear low density polyethylene obtained with a catalyst system that comprises a bridged indenoindolyl transition metal complex, a non-bridged indenoindolyl transition metal complex, an alumoxane activator and a boron-containing activator. The ultra-high molecular weight, linear low density polyethylene has a Mw greater than 1,000,000 and a density less than 0.940 g/cm3. U.S. Pat. No. 7,091,272 B2 discloses an olefin polymerization process in the presence of a clay, an activator, and a transition metal complex that has at least one pyridine moiety-containing ligand. The presence of clay increases the catalyst activity. The process is suitable for making ultra-high molecular weight polyethylenes (UHMWPE). U.S. Pat. No. 6,635,728 B2 discloses an ethylene polymerization process with a supported quinolinoxy-containing single-site catalyst in the presence of a non-alumoxane activator, but in the absence of an α-olefin comonomer, an aromatic solvent, and hydrogen to produce UHMWPE. US 2010/0056737 A1 discloses a process of manufacturing high, very high, and ultra high molecular weight polymers comprising predominantly ethylene monomers. Ethylene is reacted in the presence of a catalyst system to produce a polymer having a viscosimetrically-determined molecular weight of at least 0.7×106 g/mol. The catalyst system generally includes a bridged metallocene catalyst compound, optionally with a cocatalyst. The catalyst is characterized by a zirconium dichloride central functionality and a dimethyl silandiyl bridge between five-membered rings of indenyl groups. Both rings of the metallocene compound are substituted at the 2-position with respect to the dimethyl silandiyl bridge with a C1-C20 carbonaceous group. In WO 2011/089017 A1, a novel UHMWPE material is disclosed, comprising both Hf and Cr as a catalyst residue, preferably with the proviso that the Cr catalyst is not comprised in oxidic form in the polyethylene, displaying excellent abrasion resistance amongst other properties. The Hf and Cr, in the context of the invention, stems preferably from single site catalyst of the metallocene and/or half-sandwich metallocene type comprising organic, multidentate ligands (i.e. not from a Phillips catalyst). WO 2010/139720 A1 pertains to a process for manufacturing a UHMWPE, wherein olefin monomers are contacted with a catalytic system under polymerisation conditions under formation of a polyethylene, wherein the catalytic system comprises an active component on a particulate carrier in a site density in the range of 5*10−9 to 5*10−6 mole of catalytic sites per m2 of carrier surface area, the particulate carrier having an average particle diameter in the range of 1-300 nm, wherein the polyethylene has a Mw of at least 500 000 g/mol, and an elastic shear modulus G0N, determined directly after melting at 160° C. of at most 1.4 MPa. Fujita et al. at Mitsui Chemicals Inc. disclosed a new class of catalysts for living olefin polymerisations, the so-called phenoxyimine-based (FI) catalysts (Catalysis Today, Volume 66, Issue 1, 15 Mar. 2001, Pages 63-73 and Chemical Review, 2011, 111, 2363-2449). M. S. Weiser et al. report in the Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 2006, 691, 2945-2952 tailoring such a phenoxyimine catalyst for the synthesis of UHMWPE, as well as atactic polypropylene. Macromolecules 2011, 44, 5558-5568, also discloses phenoxyimine catalysts to prepare disentangled UHMWPE namely at conditions of a) low polymerization temperature, so that the crystallization rate is faster than the polymerization rate, and b) low concentrations of active sites, so as to minimize the interaction of the growing chains. However, a drawback of such phenoxyimine-based catalysts is that the phenoxy group does not provide sufficient rigidity to prevent the resulting metallic complex from adopting different conformations leading to the presence of multiple catalytic sites. Furthermore, phenoxy groups only have a limited number of sites which can bear substituents, these being needed for tailoring and fine-tuning in order to increase catalytic activity and/or enhance the control over the UHMWPE microstructure (short-chain branching, long-chain branching etc). Thus a new family of single-site catalysts are needed, which have ligands which are more rigid, which are easier to fine-tune with a larger number of possible substituents but are also capable of preparing UHMWPE, preferably having a narrow molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn (also called polydispersity index) namely from 1 to 5, even more preferably 1 to 3. The solution to this technical problem was found by providing Group 4 transition metal based catalysts having iminonaphthol ligands. The backbone of the iminonaphthol ligand is larger and completely planar because of the use of the aromatic naphthalene skeleton (FIG. 1). Moreover, without being bound by theory, this would lock the conformation of these complexes, unlike the phenoxyimine ligands of the prior art which are known to display flexible coordination modes. This gives opportunities for increased ligand fine-tuning and results in increased rigidity of group 4 transition metal complexes thus providing more precise control over the microstructure of polymers prepared by such catalysts. This broad family of ligands has already been disclosed in WO 2009/133026, but in the context of preparing vinyl-end capped ethylene oligomers using Group 6 metallic complexes only. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An objective of the invention is solved using a naphthoxy-imine Group 4 metal based catalyst. In particular, the invention uses the following bidentate pro-ligand of formula (I) or its tautomeric form of formula (I′) wherein R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are each independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl groups comprising from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a halogen, or silyl groups, wherein two or more of said groups can be linked together to form one or more rings, wherein Q is an atom selected from Group 16, preferably from oxygen or sulphur,wherein A is an atom selected from Group 15, preferably from nitrogen or phosphorus,wherein R2 is independently selected from an unsubstituted or substituted aryl or cycloalkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms,or from Z(R9)3 wherein Z is an atom selected from Group 14 of the Periodic Table, preferably from silicon or carbon, and each R9 is independently selected from a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, alkyl or cycloalkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms,with the restriction that R2 is a bulky group, at least as bulky as tert-butyl,wherein R8 is an unsubstituted or substituted aryl, alkyl or cycloalkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms,wherein only A and Q are capable of chelating to a same metal M. WO 2009/133026 discloses naphthoxy ligands in a broad sense, in particular for preparing Group 6 metal based catalysts, which are suitable for preparing vinyl-end capped oligomers of ethylene. However, only one bidentate ligand is specifically disclosed in WO2009/133026, namely in the examples, wherein R1 and R3 to R7 are hydrogens, R8 is C6F5 and R2 is SiPh3. There is no disclosure in WO 2009/133026 of any use in a Group 4 based metal catalyst for olefin polymerisation, let alone to prepare polyethylene such as UHMWPE. The invention covers a process for preparing such ligands. Furthermore, the invention also covers a metallic complex of formula VII: wherein R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 and R7 are each independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group comprising from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a halogen, or a silyl group, wherein two or more of said groups can be linked together to form one or more rings, wherein Q is an atom selected from Group 16, preferably from oxygen or sulphur,wherein A is an atom selected from Group 15, preferably from nitrogen or phosphorus,wherein R2 is independently selected from an unsubstituted or substituted aryl or cycloalkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms,or from Z(R9)3 wherein Z is an atom selected from Group 14 of the Periodic Table, and each R9 is independently selected from a hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, alkyl or cycloalkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms,with the restriction that R2 is a bulky group, at least as bulky as tert-butyl,wherein R8 is an unsubstituted or substituted aryl, alkyl or cycloalkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms,and wherein M is a metal Group 4 of the Periodic Table, preferably selected from titanium, zirconium or hafnium, wherein each X is the same or different and is a halogen atom, preferably chlorine, fluorine or bromine, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group comprising from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, an amido group, or an alkoxide group. The invention also covers the process for preparing such metallic complexes. In addition, the invention covers the catalyst system comprising the metallic complex of the invention and an activating agent. Optionally, the catalyst system is supported. The invention also covers the process for (co-)polymerising olefins, preferably ethylene, in the presence of the catalyst system of the invention and to the polyolefin thereby obtained. In particular, the process for preparing ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) in the presence of the catalyst system of the invention is disclosed and the UHMWPE obtained thereby. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES FIG. 1 shows a proposed three-dimensional structure of the naphthoxy-imine catalysts according to the invention. FIG. 2 shows a scheme for the preparation of the bidentate pro-ligand according to the invention. FIG. 3 shows a scheme for the preparation of the metallic complex according to the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The Bidentate Pro-ligand The bidentate pro-ligand is based on a naphthoxy-imine compound. These are more rigid than previously known phenoxy-imine compounds used in olefin polymerisation catalysts. The rigidity increases the activity of the catalyst and its lifetime, thereby allowing a ‘living’ polymerisation process to obtain polyolefins of higher molecular weight, particularly ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Furthermore, the number of possible substituents makes it possible to tailor and fine-tune the pro-ligand, in particular to increase activity and the molecular weight of the end polyolefin.

Catalyst System In addition to the above, the invention covers the catalyst system comprising the metallic complex of the invention and an activating agent The present invention also discloses a catalyst system comprising the Group 4 metallic complex of formula VII and an activating agent having an alkylating/ionising action. Suitable activating agents are well known in the art. Examples include aluminium alkyls, alumoxanes, preferably MAO, and boron-containing compounds e.g. perfluoroborate. The activating agent can be an aluminium alkyl represented by formula AIR*nX3-n wherein R* is an alkyl having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and X is a halogen. The preferred aluminium alkyls are triisobutylaluminium (TIBAL) or triethylaluminium (TEAL).

The amount of boron-containing activating agent is selected to give a B/M ratio of from 0.5 to 5, preferably of about 1.

In another alternative, the support may comprise magnesium salt, preferably MgCl2. Preferably, the support comprises from 10 to 100 wt % of magnesium salt. Polymerisation Process and the Polyolefin The invention also covers the process for (co-)polymerising olefins in the presence of the catalyst system of the invention. The process comprises the steps of: a) injecting the catalyst system of the invention into the reactor;b) injecting the olefins either before or after or simultaneously with step a);c) maintaining the reactor under polymerisation conditions;d) retrieving the polyolefin. The olefin is preferably ethylene to obtain a polyethylene in step d) comprising at least 50% wt of ethylene moieties. This polymerisation can occur in the presence of one or more comonomers selected from an alpha-olefin comprising from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably propylene or 1-hexene, to retrieve an ethylene copolymer in step d). Optionally hydrogen can be added to control the molecular weight of the polyethylene. The polymerisation process can be carried out in solution, in a slurry or in the gas phase. In a slurry process, the catalyst system is preferably supported. The slurry process can be carried out in reactor(s) suitable for such processes, namely, continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) or slurry loop reactors (in particular liquid full loop reactors). The pressure in the reactor can vary from 0.5 to 50 bars, preferably 5 to 25 bars, most preferably around 20 bar. The polymerisation temperature can vary from 0 to 100° C., preferably from 25 to 85° C. In particular, the catalyst system of the invention is particularly suitable for preparing UHMWPE from ethylene. UHMWPE is herein defined as a substantially linear ethylene homopolymer or copolymer with a weight average molecular weight of at least 1,000,000 g/mol (Da), as obtained from intrinsic viscosity (η) measurements using Margolies' equation: Mv=5.37×104(η)1.37, wherein Mv is defined as the viscosimetric molecular weight average. Preferably the UHMWPE has an intrinsic viscosity of at least 7.5 dL/g measured according to ASTM D2857, more preferably at least 8.0 dL/g, most preferably at least 10. dL/g. UHMWPE can be obtained with the present catalyst in the slurry or solution phase, using a heterogeneous (supported) catalyst system in the former case and a homogeneous (unsupported) catalyst system in the latter. The diluent or solvent of choice is a hydrocarbon, preferably a saturated hydrocarbon having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, such as isobutane or hexane. In a specific embodiment the hydrocarbon diluent or solvent may be toluene. Due to the metallic complex being a single-site catalyst, the UHMWPE has a polydispersity index (molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn) from 1 to 5, preferably 1 to 4, more preferably from 1 to 3, most preferably from 1 to 2. In order to prepare UHMWPE, the polymerisation temperature is preferably kept as low as possible, from 40 to 90° C., more preferably around 50 to 80° C., most preferably around 60° C. The polymerisation is carried out under a pressure of about 5 to 25 bars, and under the complete absence of hydrogen gas. Preferably, the catalyst concentration is sufficiently for retrieving ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. More preferably the catalyst concentration in the diluent/solvent is less than 0.05 mM, most preferably less than 0.03 mM. To obtain disentangled UHMWPE as described by Rastogi et al. in Macromolecules 2011, 44, 5558-5568, the polymerisation process can be carried out in a solution process using the catalyst system homogeneously (i.e. non-supported) at a low temperature from around 0° C. to 10° C., preferably around 5° C. and at extremely low concentration of catalyst (preferably less than 0.01 mM). In this way, the polymerisation temperature is low enough such that the crystallisation rate is faster than the polymerisation rate. The low concentration of active site also results in a minimization of the interaction between growing chains. The advantage of disentangled UHMWPE is the higher modulus and strength of films and fibres made therefrom. In addition, the disentangled UHMWPE can be stretched biaxially which is difficult, even impossible, with entangled UHMWPE. The UHMWPE (both entangled and disentangled) obtained using the catalyst system of the invention can be transformed using inter alia some of the following processes: compression molding, ram extrusion, gel spinning, and sintering. The UHMWPE are used to prepare films, tapes, and fibres for biomedical devices, ballistic protection and ropes for nautical purposes (e.g. fishing and sailing), pressure pipes, large-part blow moulding, extruded sheets etc. These techniques are well-known in the polymer industry. EXAMPLES General Procedures. All reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of nitrogen using standard Schlenk techniques or in a glovebox. With exception of the compounds given below, all reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. THF, diethyl ether and toluene were distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl; CH2Cl2, isopropanol, and pentane were distilled from CaH2 under nitrogen. Example 1 Ti-based Catalytic Polymerisation to Obtain UHMWPE Ligand Synthesis Bidentate iminonaphthol (NI) ligands: abbreviated as NI(SiR93—R8) wherein NI represents naphthoxyimine, were synthesized with the yields presented below. The synthesis was carried out according to the scheme provided in FIG. 2, in analogy with the scheme provided in WO2009/133026, which describes in particular the synthesis of such ligands starting from 2-methoxynaphthalene, wherein in the final product R2 was SiPh3 and R8 is either an alpha-quinoleine, a CH2-(2-pyridyl) or C6F5 group. The corresponding procedures were used to obtain the new NI-ligands having SiMe3 as R2 and/or C6H11 as R8. Ligand A: NI(SiMe3-C6—H11) 82% Ligand B: NI(SiMe3-C6F5) 84% Ligand C: NI(SiPh3-C6F5) 77% Before deprotection of the alcohol (step e as claimed), the product of step d) (compound of formula V as claimed), was purified by chromatographic purification to isolate the intermediate protected alcohol before deprotection. The final step in the synthesis was the Schiff-base condensation reaction of the napthoxyaldehydes with and amine, namely either pentafluoroaniline or cyclohexylamine to obtain the ligands wherein R8═C6F5 and R8═C6H11 respectively. In the former case para-toluenesulfonic acid was used as a catalyst in refluxing toluene under azeotropic water-removal whereas for the alkylamine provided the products in refluxing methanol without the need of a catalyst. Thus three different NI(SiR93—R8) ligands were successfully synthesized in 77-84% yield. Metallic Complex Synthesis Metal complexation of the naphthoxy-imine ligands was investigated with titanium (FIG. 3). Deprotonation of the ligand with n-butyllithium followed by reaction with half an equivalent of the corresponding tetrachloro metal-precursors gave rise to the formation of (NI)2TiCl2 Complexes A, B and C in moderate to good yield. Synthesis of [{NI(SiR93—R8)}2TiCl2] Complexes A, B and C. n-Butyllithium (2 eq.) was added dropwise to the corresponding iminonaphthol Ligands A, B and C (2 eq.) in diethylether at −78° C. and stirred for 2 h allowing to warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was cooled to −78° C., and a solution of TiCl4 (1 eq.) in pentane was added dropwise. The resulting suspension was stirred overnight allowing warming to room temperature. Solvents were removed in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane. LiCl was removed by centrifugation and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The resulting brown-red solids were washed with a minimal amount of pentane.

Preparation of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene The potential of NI-catalysts of complexes A, B and C in the presence of MAO cocatalyst for the preparation of UHMWPE was evaluated in a parallel reactor under conditions that favour high molecular weight (20 bar C2, 60° C., absence of H2). The results are depicted in Table 1 below. Intrinsic viscosity measurements have been used to determine the molecular weight of the resins produced according to ASTM D2857. Reactions were run both in hexane as well as toluene to study the solvent effect. For NI catalysts of complexes A, B and C activities in hexane are higher by about 20-50%. Also the molecular weight is generally higher in hexane; therefore, saturated hydrocarbons seem to be the solvent of choice for high activity and molecular weight with these catalysts. The concentration of the catalyst plays an important role in the polymerisation process to obtain UHMWPE in particular, which is in line with the living polymerization character of these catalysts, since the concentration of the catalyst had to be kept below 1 μmol in order to obtain an intrinsic viscosity of above 7.5 dL/g (see Entry 5 below which used a higher concentration of catalyst). The catalyst substituents also play a role in fine-tuning the catalytic properties. NI complexes B and C containing a C6F5 group provide the highest molecular weights. Such an effect can be tentatively explained by a C—F interaction between the growing chain and the ligand thus prohibiting beta-elimination. The size of the SiR3 substituent leads to slightly higher molecular weights when going from SiMe3 to SiPh3 (entries 3 and 6). For comparative purposes, it is believed that the use of complex X in the conditions stated in Table 1 will result in the formation of a polyethylene with an intrinsic viscosity lower than 7.5 dL/g.

Activities are averages of three or four runs. bViscosimetric molecular weight average Mv obtained from intrinsic viscosity using Margolies' equation. n.d.: not determined The molecular weight distribution Mw/Mn measured by GPC or melt-state rheometry (RDA) is between 1 and 5 due to the single-site nature of the catalyst system. When the performance of the newly developed NI catalysts is compared to other single site catalysts providing UHMWPE (as disclosed for example in Jones Jr. et al. Inorg. Chim. Acta 2010, 364, 275-281 and by Fujita et al. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2002, 344, 477-493) the results are promising. With regards to the previously known phenoxy-imine catalysts, even further fine-tuning can now be carried out to optimize catalyst activity and obtain higher molecular weights. Due to the modular synthesis of naphthoxy-imine titanium catalysts and large number of possibilities to substitute the naphthyl skeleton, such fine-tuning would be both facile and likely to yield improved systems. Example 2 Zr-based Catalytic Polymerisation to Obtain PE Experiments were also carried out to prepare polyethylene from zirconium-based catalyst systems according to the invention. Ligand Synthesis The same procedures as described for Example 1 were used. In addition to Ligand C, a further ligand was synthesized. Ligand D: NI(SiPh3-C6H11) at 91% yield: Metallic Complex Synthesis Synthesis of [{NI(SiR3—Ar)}2ZrCl2] complexes 5-6. n-Butyllithium (2 eq.) was added dropwise to the corresponding iminonaphthol ligand C or D (2 eq.) in diethylether at −78° C. and stirred for 2 h allowing to warm to rt. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was suspended in pentane. ZrCl4 (1 eq.) was added and the suspension was stirred overnight at room temperature. The resulting yellow suspension was filtered and the residue was washed with pentane and dissolved in dichloromethane. LiCl was removed by centrifugation and the solvent was removed in vacuo to obtain the product as a yellow solid. The following Metallic Zr complexes D and E were prepared with Ligands C and D respectively: Complex D [{NI(SiPh3-C6F5)}2ZrCl2] Yield: 462 mg (80%). The zirconium complexes gave 1H and 13C NMR spectra that were qualitatively identical to the corresponding titanium complexes, however, some line-broadening was observed indicating a more flexible coordination of the ligand. Complex E [{NI(SiPh3-C6H11)}2ZrCl2] Yield: 278 mg (49%). Preparation of Polyethylene The potential of NI-catalysts of Zr complexes D and E in the presence of MAO cocatalyst for the preparation of PE was evaluated in a parallel reactor under conditions of 20 bar C2, 60° C. in the absence of H2. The results are depicted in Table 2 below. Intrinsic viscosity measurements have been used as above to determine the molecular weight of the resins produced according to ASTM D2857. The concentration of the catalyst was added at a concentration of above 1 μmol in order to obtain an intrinsic viscosity of less than 7.5 dL/g. As described above, lower catalyst concentrations favour the preparation of UHMWPE, which was not envisaged herein.
