FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates to sunscreen compositions comprising a synergistic combination of ultra violet (“UV”) filters, and to methods of using the combination of UV filters to protect keratinous substrates such as skin and hair from UV radiation. BACKGROUND The negative effects of exposure to ultraviolet (“UV”) light are well-known. Prolonged exposure to sunlight causes damage such as sunburn to the skin and dries out hair making it brittle. When skin is exposed to UV light having a wavelength of from about 290 nm to about 400 nm, long term damage can lead to serious conditions such as skin cancer. UV light also contributes to aging by causing free radicals to form in the skin. Free radicals include, for example, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, the superoxide anion, nitric oxide and hydrogen radicals. Free radicals attack DNA, membrane lipids and proteins, generating carbon radicals. These in turn react with oxygen to produce a peroxyl radical that can attack adjacent fatty acids to generate new carbon radicals. This cascade leads to a chain reaction producing lipid peroxidation products. Damage to the cell membrane results in loss of cell permeability, increased intercellular ionic concentration, and decreased ability to excrete or detoxify waste products. The end result is a loss of skin elasticity and the appearance of wrinkles. This process is commonly referred to as photo-aging. Sunscreens can be used to protect against UV damage and delay the signs of aging. The degree of UV protection afforded by a sunscreen composition is directly related to the amount and type of UV filters contained therein. The higher the amount of UV filters, the greater the degree of UV protection. Nevertheless, it is desirable to achieve the best photo protection efficacy with the lowest amount of UV filters. The inventors of the instant disclosure discovered ways to attain SPFs that were not previously attainable with such low amounts of overall UV filters. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to sunscreen compositions that have low amounts of UV filters yet excellent Sun Protection Factors (SPF). Typically, the more UV filters included in a sunscreen composition the higher the SPF. The inventors discovered that when certain UV filters are combined in particular ratios, they interact synergistically to exhibit a surprisingly effective SPF. This allows for use of less UV filters while achieving sufficient SPF. The present disclosure relates to a sunscreen composition comprising a combination of the UV filters set forth in the table below: TECHNICAL INCI NAME NAME Octocrylene Octocrylene Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane Avobenzone Bis-EthylHexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine Tinsorb S Ethylhexyl Triazone Uvinul T150 Terephthalylidene Dicampohor Sulfonic Acid Mexoryl SX The ratio of each filter relative to avobenzone in the sunscreen compositions is typically as follows: the ratio of octocrylene to avobenzone is 0.8:1.0 to 1.6:1.0;the ratio of Tinsorb S to avobenzone is 0.2:1.0 to 0.6:1.0;the ratio of Uvinul T150 to avobenzone is 0.3:1.0 to 0.6:1.0; andthe ratio of Mexoryl SX to avobenzone is 0.01:1.0 to 0.3:1.0. In particular, the ratio of each filter relative to avobenzone is about: 1.2:1.0:0.3:0.5:0.1 (octocrylene:avobenzone:Tinsorb S:Uvinul T150:Mexoryl SX). In one embodiment the UV filters are present in the following percentages by weight relative to the entire weight of the sunscreen composition: 2 to 7 wt. % octocrylene;2 to 5 wt. % avobenzone;0.1% to 2 wt. % Tinsorb S;0.1% to 3 wt. % Uvinul T150; and0.1% to 2 wt. % Mexoryl SX. In another embodiment the UV filters are present in the following percentages by weight relative to the entire weight of the sunscreen composition: about 6% octocrylene; about 5% Avobenzone; about 1.5% Tinsorb S; about 2.5% Uvinul T150; and about 0.33% Mexoryl SX. The present disclosure is also directed to methods of protecting a keratinous substrate from ultraviolet radiation and to methods of absorbing ultraviolet light. Such methods encompass applying a sunscreen composition to a keratinous substrate and subjecting the keratinous substrate to ultraviolet radiation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Where the following terms are used in this specification, they are used as defined below. The terms “comprising,” “having,” and “including” are used in their open, non-limiting sense. The terms “a” and “the” are understood to encompass the plural as well as the singular. As used herein, the expression “at least one” means one or more and thus includes individual components as well as mixtures/combinations. “Cosmetically acceptable” means that the item in question is compatible with any keratinous substrate. For example, “cosmetically acceptable carrier” means a carrier that is compatible with any keratinous substrate. A “physiologically acceptable medium” means a medium which is not toxic and can be applied to the skin, lips, hair, scalp, lashes, brows, nails or any other cutaneous region of the body. The composition of the instant disclosure may especially constitute a cosmetic or dermatological composition. The phrase “essentially free” refers to less than or equal to 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 or 0.01 wt. %. The phrase “stable emulsion” refers to a composition that does not undergo phase separation up to a temperature of 45° C. for at least two weeks. As mentioned above, the present disclosure relates to a sunscreen composition having the following combination of UV filters: octocrylene, avobenzone, Tinosorb S, Tinsorb S, Uvinul T150, Mexoryl SX; wherein the ratio of each filter relative to avobenzone is as follows: The ratio of each filter relative to avobenzone in the sunscreen compositions is typically as follows: the ratio of octocrylene to avobenzone is 0.8:1.0 to 1.6:1.0;the ratio of Tinsorb S to avobenzone is 0.2:1.0 to 0.6:1.0;the ratio of Uvinul T150 to avobenzone is 0.3:1.0 to 0.6:1.0; andthe ratio of Mexoryl SX to avobenzone is 0.01:1.0 to 0.3:1.0. In particular, the ratio of each filter relative to avobenzone is about: 1.2:1.0:0.3:0.5:0.1 (octocrylene:avobenzone:Tinsorb S:Uvinul T150:Mexoryl SX). The total amount of the combination of UV filters can vary depending on the desired SPF and overall UV filtering strength of a final sunscreen composition. In one aspect, the total amount of the combination of UV filters in a sunscreen combination is about 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 wt. % or less. In another aspect, the sunscreen formulation has an SPF value that is at least about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 times the total weight percent of the combination of UV filters of the sunscreen compositions. For example, it is possible for a composition comprising about 15.11 wt. % of a total combination of UV filters to exhibit an SPF of 133.79, as shown in Example 1 below (the SPF is about 8.6 times higher than the total amount of the combination of UV filters used in the composition). In one embodiment the UV filters are independently present in the following percentages by weight relative to the entire weight of the sunscreen composition: from about 2, 3, 4 or 5, to about 6.5 or 7 wt. % octocrylene; from about 2, 3, 4, or 4.5 to about 5 wt. % avobenzone; from about 0.1, 0.5 or 1 to about 2 wt. % Tinsorb S; from about 0.1, 1, or 2 to about 3 wt. % Uvinul T150; and from about 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 to about 1, 1.5, or 2 wt. % Mexoryl SX.
