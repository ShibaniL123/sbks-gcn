No. A39-165: 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N-[1-(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]methanesulfonamide
Ethyl (2E)-3-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)acrylate (3.67 g, 15.32 mmol) and 3,3-difluorocyclobutylamine hydrochloride (4.40 g, 30.65 mmol) were dissolved under argon in abs. N,N-dimethylacetamide (15 mL), and then N,N-diisopropylethylamine (60 mL) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at a temperature of 90° C. for 8 h and, after cooling to room temperature, water and dichloromethane were added. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), ethyl (2E)-3-{2-[(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}acrylate (4.07 g, 77% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.30 (m, 1H), 8.17 (m, 1H), 7.69 (d, 1H), 6.51-6.47 (m, 2H), 4.84 (br. m, 1H, NH), 4.31 (q, 2H), 4.03-3.97 (m, 1H), 3.22-3.13 (m, 2H), 2.65-2.55 (m, 2H), 1.36 (t, 3H). Ethyl (2E)-3-{2-[(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}acrylate (4.07 g, 12.47 mmol) was then dissolved in abs. ethanol (100 mL), and (Ph3P)3RhCl (1.15 g, 1.25 mmol) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 5 min, hydrogen was introduced into the reaction solution with a constant gas flow via a gas introduction apparatus for 4 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by LCMS. On completion of conversion, the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), it was possible to isolate ethyl 3-{2-[(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}propanoate (4.12 g, 96% of theory) as a colorless solid. Ethyl 3-{2-[(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}propanoate (4.12 g, 12.55 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of abs. methanol and water (ratio 4:1, 100 mL), and sodium hydroxide solution (2N, 6.90 mL) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and, after the reaction had ended, concentrated. The remaining residue was taken up in water and washed once with dichloromethane. The aqueous phase was then acidified with 10% HCl and then extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. After the organic phases had been dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated, it was possible to isolate 3-{2-[(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}propanecarboxylic acid (1.92 g, 48% of theory) as a colorless solid. 3-{2-[(3,3-Difluorocyclobutyl)amino]-5-nitrophenyl}propanecarboxylic acid (1.92 g, 6.39 mmol), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (1.35 g, 7.03 mmol) and 1-hydroxy-1H-benzotriazole hydrate (1.077 g, 7.03 mmol) were successively added to 30 mL of abs. N,N-dimethylformamide and, after stirring at room temperature for 5 minutes, triethylamine (1.96 mL, 14.07 mmol) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 7 h, and then water and dichloromethane were added cautiously. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 1-(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (1.87 g, 98%) was isolated as a colorless solid, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.17 (m, 1H), 8.13 (m, 1H), 6.81 (d, 1H), 4.32 (m, 1H), 3.32-3.17 (m, 2H), 3.03-2.97 (m, 2H), 2.90-2.77 (m, 2H), 2.70-2.66 (m, 2H). In the next step, 1-(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)-6-nitro-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (1.84 g, 6.52 mmol) was added together with tin(II) chloride dihydrate (5.88 g, 26.08 mmol) to abs. ethanol (50 mL) and the mixture was stirred under argon at a temperature of 60° C. for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-water and then adjusted to pH 12 with aqueous NaOH (6 N). The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 6-amino-1-(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (1.60 g, 98% of theory) was isolated as a highly viscous foamH-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 6.55-6.48 (m, 3H), 4.23 (m, 1H), 3.57 (br. s, 2H, NH2), 3.19-3.08 (m, 2H), 2.90-2.80 (m, 2H), 2.79-2.74 (m, 2H), 2.54-2.50 (m, 2H). 6-Amino-1-(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (154 mg, 0.61 mmol) was dissolved together with (4-chlorophenyl)methanesulfonyl chloride (137 mg, 0.61 mmol) in abs. acetonitrile (10 mL) in a baked-out round-bottom flask under argon, then pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.83 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at a temperature of 70° C. for 4 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure, the remaining residue was admixed with dil. HCl and dichloromethane, and the aqueous phase was extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-[1-(3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)-2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]methanesulfonamide (182 mg, 67% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid.
