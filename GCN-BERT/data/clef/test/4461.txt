RECOMBINANT LISTERIA VACCINE STRAINS AND METHODS OF PRODUCING THE SAME FIELD OF INVENTION [001] The present invention provides methods of treating, protecting against, and inducing an immune response against a tumor or cancer, comprising the step of administering to a subject a recombinant Listeria strain comprising a nucleic acid encoding a mutant PrfA protein that partially restores PrfA function. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [002] Persistent infection with high-oncogenic risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types is recognized as a necessary, but not sufficient, cause of invasive carcinoma of the cervix (ICC) [1-3]. HPVs 16 and 18 are the most prevalent types in malignant lesions, accounting for over 70% of ICC and over 50% of high-grade precursor lesions. The HR-HPV E6 and E7 proteins are consistently expressed in dysplasias and carcinomas, disrupting the cell cycle regulatory proteins p53 and pRb, respectively. The obligatory expression of E6 and E7 by both dysplastic and invasive malignant lesions, as well as the viral origin of these proteins, make them excellent targets for HPV therapeutic vaccines. [003] Listeria monocytogenes {Lm) is a food-borne gram-positive bacterium that can occasionally cause disease in humans, in particular elderly individuals, newborns, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. In addition to strongly activating innate immunity and inducing a cytokine response that enhances antigen-presenting cell (APC) function, Lm has the ability to replicate in the cytosol of APCs after escaping from the phagolysosome, mainly through the action of the listeriolysin O (LLO) protein. This unique intracellular life cycle allows antigens secreted by Lm to be processed and presented in the context of both MHC class I and II molecules, resulting in potent cytotoxic CD8+ and Thl CD4+ T-cell-mediated immune responses. Lm has been extensively investigated as a vector for cancer immunotherapy in pre-clinical models. Immunization of mice with Lm-LLO-E7 induces regression of established tumors expressing E7 and confers long-term protection. The therapeutic efficacy of Lm-LLO-E7 correlates with its ability to induce E7-specific CTLs that infiltrate the tumor site, mature dendritic cells, reduce the number of intratumoral regulatory CD4+ CD25+ T cells and inhibit tumor angiogenesis. [004] Lm has also a number of inherent advantages as a vaccine vector. The bacterium grows very efficiently in vitro without special requirements and it lacks LPS, which is a major toxicity factor in gram-negative bacteria, such as Salmonella. Genetically attenuated Lm vectors also offer additional safety as they can be readily eliminated with antibiotics, in case of serious adverse effects and unlike some viral vectors, no integration of genetic material into the host genome occurs. However, there is always great concern about the safety of a live bacterial vaccine such as Lm, especially regarding its mechanism of attenuation. [005] The PrfA protein controls the expression of a regulon comprising essential virulence genes required by Lm to colonize its vertebrate hosts; hence the prfA mutation strongly impairs PrfA ability to activate expression of PrfA-dependent virulence genes. The present invention addresses this concern by providing a prfA mutant Listeria that carries a mutant prfA (D133V) gene in the pGG55 plasmid that restores partial PrfA function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [006] In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a recombinant Listeria strain, said recombinant Listeria strain comprising a recombinant nucleic acid, said nucleic acid comprising a first open reading frame encoding a recombinant polypeptide comprising a first an N-terminal fragment of an LLO protein fused to a heterologous antigen or fragment thereof, and wherein said recombinant nucleic acid further comprises a second open reading frame encoding a mutant PrfA protein.

In another embodiment, the mutant PrfA protein encoded by said second open reading frame complements said genomic mutation or deletion in said Listeria strain' s PrfA protein. In another embodiment, the mutant PrfA protein encoded by said second open reading frame restores partial PrfA function in said Listeria strain.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0010] The subject matter regarded as the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification. The invention, however, both as to organization and method of operation, together with objects, features, and advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following detailed description when read with the accompanying drawings in which: [0011] Figure 1. Lm-E7 and Lm-LLO-E7 use different expression systems to express and secrete E7. Lm-E7 was generated by introducing a gene cassette into the orfZ domain of the L. monocytogenes genome (A). The hly promoter drives expression of the hly signal sequence and the first five amino acids (AA) of LLO followed by HPV-16 E7. B), Lm-LLO- E7 was generated by transforming the prfA- strain XFL-7 with the plasmid pGG-55. pGG-55 has the hly promoter driving expression of a nonhemolytic fusion of LLO-E7. pGG-55 also contains the prfA gene to select for retention of the plasmid by XFL-7 in vivo.

Equivalent numbers of bacteria, as determined by OD at 600 nm absorbance, were pelleted and 18 ml of each supernatant was TCA precipitated. E7 expression was analyzed by Western blot. The blot was probed with an anti- E7 mAb, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (Amersham), then developed using ECL detection reagents. [0013] Figure 3.

In another embodiment, the mutant PrfA protein encoded by said second open reading frame complements said genomic mutation or deletion in said Listeria strain's prfA gene. In another embodiment, the mutant PrfA protein encoded by said second open reading frame restores partial PrfA function in said Listeria strain. In one embodiment, the mutant PrfA protein encoded by said second open reading frame comprises a point mutation in position 133. In another embodiment, the mutation on residue 133 of the PrfA amino acid sequence is from amino acid D or Asp or Aspartate (or Aspartic acid) to amino acid V or Val or Valine. [0035] The present invention further provides immunogenic compositions comprising a recombinant Listeria strain provided herein and methods of using the same, including methods of treating, protecting against, and inducing an immune response against a disease, where in some embodiments, the disease is a tumor or cancer. [0036] The present invention also provides methods for inducing an anti-disease cytotoxic T- cell (CTL) response in a subject and treating disorders, and symptoms associated with said disease comprising administering a recombinant Listeria strain provided herein, wherein in some embodiments the disease is a tumor or a cancer. [0037] In another embodiment, a recombinant Listeria provided herein is an attenuated Listeria. "Attenuation" and "attenuated" may encompass a bacterium, virus, parasite, infectious organism, prion, tumor cell, gene in the infectious organism, and the like, that is modified to reduce toxicity to a host. The host can be a human or animal host, or an organ, tissue, or cell. The bacterium, to give a non-limiting example, can be attenuated to reduce binding to a host cell, to reduce spread from one host cell to another host cell, to reduce extracellular growth, or to reduce intracellular growth in a host cell. Attenuation can be assessed by measuring, e.g., an indicum or indicia of toxicity, the LDa, the rate of clearance from an organ, or the competitive index (see, e.g., Auerbuch, et al. (2001) Infect. Immunity 69:5953-5957). Generally, an attenuation results an increase in the LDsoand/or an increase in the rate of clearance by at least 25%; more generally by at least 50%; most generally by at least 100% (2-fold); normally by at least 5-fold; more normally by at least 10-fold; most normally by at least 50-fold; often by at least 100-fold; more often by at least 500-fold; and most often by at least 1000-fold; usually by at least 5000-fold; more usually by at least 10,000-fold; and most usually by at least 50,000-fold; and most often by at least 100,000-fold. [0038] It will be well appreciated by a skilled artisan that the term "Attenuated gene" may encompass a gene that mediates toxicity, pathology, or virulence, to a host, growth within the host, or survival within the host, where the gene is mutated in a way that mitigates, reduces, or eliminates the toxicity, pathology, or virulence. The reduction or elimination can be assessed by comparing the virulence or toxicity mediated by the mutated gene with that mediated by the non-mutated (or parent) gene. "Mutated gene" encompasses deletions, point mutations, and frameshift mutations in regulatory regions of the gene, coding regions of the gene, non- coding regions of the gene, or any combination thereof.

[0091] In one embodiment, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important signaling protein involved in both vasculogenesis (the formation of the embryonic circulatory system) and angiogenesis (the growth of blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature). In one embodiment, VEGF activity is restricted mainly to cells of the vascular endothelium, although it does have effects on a limited number of other cell types (e.g. stimulation monocyte/macrophage migration). In vitro, VEGF has been shown to stimulate endothelial cell mitogenesis and cell migration. VEGF also enhances microvascular permeability and is sometimes referred to as vascular permeability factor. [0092] In one embodiment, all of the members of the VEGF family stimulate cellular responses by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors (the VEGFRs) on the cell surface, causing them to dimerize and become activated through transphosphorylation. The VEGF receptors have an extracellular portion consisting of 7 immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane spanning region and an intracellular portion containing a split tyrosine-kinase domain. [0093] In one embodiment, VEGF- A is a VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-l) ligand as well as a VEGFR-1 (Flt-l) ligand. In one embodiment, VEGFR- mediates almost all of the known cellular responses to VEGF. The function of VEGFR-1 is less well defined, although it is thought to modulate VEGFR-2 signaling, in one embodiment, via sequestration of VEGF from VEGFR-2 binding, which in one embodiment, is particularly important during vasculogenesis in the embryo. In one embodiment, VEGF-C and VEGF-D are ligands of the VEGFR-3 receptor, which in one embodiment, mediates lymphangiogenesis. [0094] In one embodiment, the antigen of the present invention is a VEGF receptor or a fragment thereof, which in one embodiment, is a VEGFR-2 and, in another embodiment, a VEGFR-1, and, in another embodiment, VEGFR-3. [0095] In one embodiment, vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is highly expressed on activated endothelial cells (ECs) and participates in the formation of new blood vessels. In one embodiment, VEGFR2 binds all 5 isoforms of VEGF. In one embodiment, signaling of VEGF through VEGFR2 on ECs induces proliferation, migration, and eventual differentiation. In one embodiment, the mouse homologue of VEGFR2 is the fetal liver kinase gene-1 (Flk-l), which is a strong therapeutic target, and has important roles in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. In one embodiment, VEGFR2 is also referred to as kinase insert domain receptor (a type III receptor tyrosine kinase) (KDR), cluster of differentiation 309 (CD309), FLK1, Ly73, Krd-1, VEGFR, VEGFR-2, or 6130401C07.

[00127] In one embodiment, provided herein is a nucleic acid molecule that is used to transform the Listeria in order to arrive at a recombinant Listeria. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid provided herein used to transform Listeria lacks a virulence gene. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is integrated into the Listeria genome and carries a non-functional virulence gene. In another embodiment, the virulence gene is mutated in the recombinant Listeria. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is used to inactivate the endogenous gene present in the Listeria genome. In yet another embodiment, the virulence gene is an actA gene, an inlA gene, and MB gene, an inlC gene, inlJ gene, a plbC gene, a bsh gene, or a prfA gene. It is to be understood by a skilled artisan, that the virulence gene can be any gene known in the art to be associated with virulence in the recombinant Listeria. [00128] In one embodiment, a live attenuated Listeria provided herein is a recombinant Listeria. In another embodiment, a recombinant Listeria provided herein comprises a mutation of a genomic internalin C (inlC) gene. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria comprises a mutation or a deletion of a genomic actA gene and a genomic internalin C gene. In one embodiment, translocation of Listeria to adjacent cells is inhibited by the deletion of the actA gene and/or the inlC gene, which are involved in the process, thereby resulting in unexpectedly high levels of attenuation with increased immunogenicity and utility as a strain backbone. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. [00129] It will be appreciated by a skilled artisan that the term "attenuation," may encompass a diminution in the ability of the bacterium to cause disease in an animal. In other words, for example the pathogenic characteristics of the attenuated Listeria strain have been lessened compared with wild-type Listeria, although the attenuated Listeria is capable of growth and maintenance in culture. Using as an example the intravenous inoculation of Balb/c mice with an attenuated Listeria, the lethal dose at which 50% of inoculated animals survive (LD50) is preferably increased above the LD50 of wild-type Listeria by at least about 10-fold, more preferably by at least about 100-fold, more preferably at least about 1 ,000 fold, even more preferably at least about 10,000 fold, and most preferably at least about 100,000-fold. An attenuated strain of Listeria is thus one which does not kill an animal to which it is administered, or is one which kills the animal only when the number of bacteria administered is vastly greater than the number of wild type non-attenuated bacteria which would be required to kill the same animal. An attenuated bacterium should also be construed to mean one which is incapable of replication in the general environment because the nutrient required for its growth is not present therein. Thus, the bacterium is limited to replication in a controlled environment wherein the required nutrient is provided. The attenuated strains of the present invention are therefore environmentally safe in that they are incapable of uncontrolled replication. [00130] In yet another embodiment, a Listeria strain provided herein is an inlA mutant, an MB mutant, an inlC mutant, an inlJ mutant, prfA mutant, actA mutant, a dal/dat mutant, a prfA mutant, a plcB deletion mutant, or a double mutant lacking both plcA and plcB. In another embodiment, the Listeria comprises a deletion or mutation of these genes individually or in combination. In another embodiment, the Listeria provided herein lack each one of genes. In another embodiment, the Listeria provided herein lack at least one and up to ten of any gene provided herein, including the actA, prfA, and dal/dat genes. In another embodiment, the prfA mutant is a D133V PrfA mutant. [00131] In one embodiment, the metabolic gene, the virulence gene, etc. is lacking in a chromosome of the Listeria strain. In another embodiment, the metabolic gene, virulence gene, etc. is lacking in the chromosome and in any episomal genetic element of the Listeria strain. In another embodiment, the metabolic gene, virulence gene, etc. is lacking in the genome of the virulence strain. In one embodiment, the virulence gene is mutated in the chromosome. In another embodiment, the virulence gene is deleted from the chromosome. In another embodiment, the metabolic gene, the virulence gene, etc. is mutated in a chromosome of the Listeria strain. In another embodiment, the metabolic gene, virulence gene, etc. is mutated in the chromosome and in any episomal genetic element of the Listeria strain. In another embodiment, the metabolic gene, virulence gene, etc. is mutated in the genome of the virulence strain. In another embodiment, the virulence gene is deleted from the chromosome. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. [00132] In one embodiment, a recombinant Listeria strain provided herein is attenuated. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria lacks the actA virulence gene. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria lacks the prfA virulence gene. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria lacks the inlB gene. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria lacks both, the actA and MB genes. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation of the endogenous actA gene. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation of the endogenous MB gene. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation of the endogenous inlC gene. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation of the endogenous actA and B genes. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation of the endogenous actA and MC genes. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation of the endogenous actA, MB, and MC genes. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation of the endogenous actA, MB, and MC genes. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation of the endogenous actA, MB, and inlC genes. In another embodiment, the recombinant Listeria strain provided herein comprises an inactivating mutation in any single gene or combination of the following genes: actA, dal, dat, B, MC, prfA, pic A, plcB. [00133] It will be appreciated by a skilled artisan that the term "mutation" and grammatical equivalents thereof, include any type of mutation or modification to the sequence (nucleic acid or amino acid sequence), and includes a deletion mutation, a truncation, an inactivation, a disruption, or a translocation. These types of mutations are readily known in the art. [00134] In one embodiment, in order to select for auxotrophic bacteria comprising a plasmid encoding a metabolic enzyme or a complementing gene provided herein, transformed auxotrophic bacteria are grown on a media that will select for expression of the amino acid metabolism gene or the complementing gene. In another embodiment, a bacteria auxotrophic for D-glutamic acid synthesis is transformed with a plasmid comprising a gene for D-glutamic acid synthesis, and the auxotrophic bacteria will grow in the absence of D-glutamic acid, whereas auxotrophic bacteria that have not been transformed with the plasmid, or are not expressing the plasmid encoding a protein for D-glutamic acid synthesis, will not grow. In another embodiment, a bacterium auxotrophic for D-alanine synthesis will grow in the absence of D-alanine when transformed and expressing the plasmid of the present invention if the plasmid comprises an isolated nucleic acid encoding an amino acid metabolism enzyme for D-alanine synthesis. Such methods for making appropriate media comprising or lacking necessary growth factors, supplements, amino acids, vitamins, antibiotics, and the like are well known in the art, and are available commercially (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). [00135] In another embodiment, once the auxotrophic bacteria comprising the plasmid of the present invention have been selected on appropriate media, the bacteria are propagated in the presence of a selective pressure. Such propagation comprises growing the bacteria in media without the auxotrophic factor. The presence of the plasmid expressing an amino acid metabolism enzyme in the auxotrophic bacteria ensures that the plasmid will replicate along with the bacteria, thus continually selecting for bacteria harboring the plasmid. The skilled artisan, when equipped with the present disclosure and methods herein will be readily able to scale-up the production of the Listeria vaccine vector by adjusting the volume of the media in which the auxotrophic bacteria comprising the plasmid are growing. [00136] The skilled artisan will appreciate that, in another embodiment, other auxotroph strains and complementation systems are adopted for the use with this invention.

[00140] It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that the term "Boosting" may encompass administering an immunogenic composition or recombinant Listeria strain dose to a subject.

In another embodiment, the PEST amino acid sequence is another PEST amino acid AA sequence derived from a prokaryotic organism. In another embodiment, the PEST amino acid sequence is any other PEST amino acid sequence known in the art. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.

Sci. 21 :267-271) for LM. Alternatively, PEST amino acid AA sequences from other prokaryotic organisms can also be identified based by this method. Other prokaryotic organisms wherein PEST amino acid AA sequences would be expected to include, but are not limited to, other Listeria species. In another embodiment, the PEST amino acid sequence is embedded within the antigenic protein. Thus, in another embodiment, "fusion" refers to an antigenic protein comprising both the antigen and either i) an N-terminal LLO protein (tLLO), ii) an N-terminal ActA protein or iii) a PEST amino acid sequence either linked at one end of the antigen or embedded within the antigen.

Bioinformatics. 2005 Jun;21 Suppl l:il 69-76). In another embodiment, the following method is used: [00160] A PEST index is calculated for each 30-35 AA stretch by assigning a value of 1 to the amino acids Ser, Thr, Pro, Glu, Asp, Asn, or Gin. The coefficient value (CV) for each of the PEST residue is 1 and for each of the other AA (non-PEST) is 0.

In another embodiment, the present invention utilizes an analog of an LLO protein, ActA protein, or fragment thereof.

[00177] Protein and/or peptide homology for any AA sequence listed herein is determined, in one embodiment, by methods well described in the art, including immunoblot analysis, or via computer algorithm analysis of AA sequences, utilizing any of a number of software packages available, via established methods. Some of these packages include the FASTA, BLAST, MPsrch or Scanps packages, and employ, in other embodiments, the use of the Smith and Waterman algorithms, and/or global/local or BLOCKS alignments for analysis, for example. Each method of determining homology represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. [00178] In another embodiment, the LLO protein, ActA protein, or fragment thereof is attached to the antigen by chemical conjugation. In another embodiment, glutaraldehyde is used for the conjugation. In another embodiment, the conjugation is performed using any suitable method known in the art. Each possibility represents another embodiment of the present invention. [00179] In another embodiment, fusion proteins of the present invention are prepared by any suitable method, including, for example, cloning and restriction of appropriate sequences or direct chemical synthesis by methods discussed below. In another embodiment, subsequences are cloned and the appropriate subsequences cleaved using appropriate restriction enzymes. The fragments are then ligated, in another embodiment, to produce the desired DNA sequence. In another embodiment, DNA encoding the fusion protein is produced using DNA amplification methods, for example polymerase chain reaction (PCR). First, the segments of the native DNA on either side of the new terminus are amplified separately. The 5' end of the one amplified sequence encodes the peptide linker, while the 3' end of the other amplified sequence also encodes the peptide linker. Since the 5' end of the first fragment is complementary to the 3' end of the second fragment, the two fragments (after partial purification, e.g. on LMP agarose) can be used as an overlapping template in a third PCR reaction. The amplified sequence will contain codons, the segment on the carboxy side of the opening site (now forming the amino sequence), the linker, and the sequence on the amino side of the opening site (now forming the carboxyl sequence). The insert is then ligated into a plasmid. [00180] In another embodiment, the LLO protein, ActA protein, or fragment thereof and the antigen, or fragment thereof are conjugated by a means known to those of skill in the art. In another embodiment, the antigen, or fragment thereof is conjugated, either directly or through a linker (spacer), to the ActA protein or LLO protein. In another embodiment, the chimeric molecule is recombinantly expressed as a single-chain fusion protein. [00181] In another embodiment, a fusion peptide of the present invention is synthesized using standard chemical peptide synthesis techniques. In another embodiment, the chimeric molecule is synthesized as a single contiguous polypeptide. In another embodiment, the LLO protein, ActA protein, or fragment thereof; and the antigen, or fragment thereof are synthesized separately, then fused by condensation of the amino terminus of one molecule with the carboxyl terminus of the other molecule, thereby forming a peptide bond. In another embodiment, the ActA protein or LLO protein and antigen are each condensed with one end of a peptide spacer molecule, thereby forming a contiguous fusion protein. [00182] In another embodiment, the peptides and proteins of the present invention are prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) as described by Stewart et al. in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd Edition, 1984, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, 111.; or as described by Bodanszky and Bodanszky (The Practice of Peptide Synthesis, 1984, Springer- Verlag, New York). In another embodiment, a suitably protected AA residue is attached through its carboxyl group to a derivatized, insoluble polymeric support, such as cross-linked polystyrene or polyamide resin. "Suitably protected" refers to the presence of protecting groups on both the alpha-amino group of the amino acid, and on any side chain functional groups. Side chain protecting groups are generally stable to the solvents, reagents and reaction conditions used throughout the synthesis, and are removable under conditions which will not affect the final peptide product. Stepwise synthesis of the oligopeptide is carried out by the removal of the N- protecting group from the initial AA, and couple thereto of the carboxyl end of the next AA in the sequence of the desired peptide. This AA is also suitably protected. The carboxyl of the incoming AA can be activated to react with the N-terminus of the support-bound AA by formation into a reactive group such as formation into a carbodiimide, a symmetric acid anhydride or an "active ester" group such as hydroxybenzotriazole or pentafluorophenly esters. The pharmaceutical compositions containing vaccines and compositions of the present invention are, in another embodiment, administered to a subject by any method known to a person skilled in the art, such as parenterally, paracancerally, transmucosally, transdermally, intramuscularly, intravenously, intra-dermally, subcutaneously, intra-peritonealy, intra- ventricularly, intra-cranially, intra-vaginally or intra-tumorally. [00183] In another embodiment of the methods and compositions provided herein, the vaccines or compositions are administered orally, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for oral administration, i.e. as a solid or a liquid preparation. Suitable solid oral formulations include tablets, capsules, pills, granules, pellets and the like. Suitable liquid oral formulations include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oils and the like. In another embodiment of the present invention, the active ingredient is formulated in a capsule. In accordance with this embodiment, the compositions of the present invention comprise, in addition to the active compound and the inert carrier or diluent, a hard gelating capsule. [00184] In another embodiment, the vaccines or compositions are administered by intravenous, intra-arterial, or intra-muscular injection of a liquid preparation. Suitable liquid formulations include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oils and the like. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intravenously and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intravenous administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intra- arterially and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intra- arterial administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intra-muscularly and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intra-muscular administration. [00185] It will be appreciated by a skilled artisan that the term "treating" may encompass both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or lessen the targeted pathologic condition or disorder as described herein. Thus, in one embodiment, treating may include directly affecting or curing, suppressing, inhibiting, preventing, reducing the severity of, delaying the onset of, reducing symptoms associated with the disease, disorder or condition, or a combination thereof. Thus, in one embodiment, "treating" may encompass inter alia delaying progression, expediting remission, inducing remission, augmenting remission, speeding recovery, increasing efficacy of or decreasing resistance to alternative therapeutics, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, "preventing" or "impeding" may encompass, inter alia, delaying the onset of symptoms, preventing relapse to a disease, decreasing the number or frequency of relapse episodes, increasing latency between symptomatic episodes, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, "suppressing" or "inhibiting", may encompass, inter alia, reducing the severity of symptoms, reducing the severity of an acute episode, reducing the number of symptoms, reducing the incidence of disease-related symptoms, reducing the latency of symptoms, ameliorating symptoms, reducing secondary symptoms, reducing secondary infections, prolonging patient survival, or a combination thereof. [00186] In one embodiment, symptoms are primary, while in another embodiment, symptoms are secondary. In one embodiment, "primary" refers to a symptom that is a direct result of a particular disease or disorder, while in one embodiment, "secondary" refers to a symptom that is derived from or consequent to a primary cause. In one embodiment, the compounds for use in the present invention treat primary or secondary symptoms or secondary complications. In another embodiment, "symptoms" may be any manifestation of a disease or pathological condition. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a kit comprising vaccine of the present invention, an applicator, and instructional material that describes use of the methods of the invention. Although model kits are described below, the contents of other useful kits will be apparent to the skilled artisan in light of the present disclosure. Each of these kits represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. [00187] In one embodiment, the singular forms of words such as "a," "an," and "the," include their corresponding plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. [00188] Throughout this application, various embodiments of this invention may be presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible sub ranges as well as individual numerical values within that range. For example, description of a range such as from 1 to 6 should be considered to have specifically disclosed sub ranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This applies regardless of the breadth of the range. [00189] Whenever a numerical range is indicated herein, it is meant to include any cited numeral (fractional or integral) within the indicated range. The phrases "ranging/ranges between" a first indicate number and a second indicate number and "ranging/ranges from" a first indicate number "to" a second indicate number are used herein interchangeably and are meant to include the first and second indicated numbers and all the fractional and integral numerals there between. [00190] It will be appreciated by a skilled artisan that the term "about" when used to modify a numerically defined parameter may encompass variation of the parameter in quantitative terms plus or minus 5%, or in another embodiment plus or minus 10%, or in another embodiment plus or minus 15%, or in another embodiment plus or minus 20% of stated numerical value for that parameter. [00191] It is to be understood by the skilled artisan that the term "subject" can encompass a mammal including an adult human or a human child, teenager or adolescent in need of therapy for, or susceptible to, a condition or its sequelae, and also may include non-human mammals such as dogs, cats, pigs, cows, sheep, goats, horses, rats, and mice. It will also be appreciated that the term may encompass livestock. The term "subject" does not exclude an individual that is normal in all respects. [00192] It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that the term "mammal" for purposes of treatment refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as canines, including dogs, and horses, cats, cattle, pigs, sheep, etc. [00193] In the following examples, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention. Thus these examples should in no way be construed, as limiting the broad scope of the invention. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS SECTION EXAMPLE 1: LLP- ANTIGEN FUSIONS INDUCE ANTI-TUMOR IMMUNITY MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS (EXAMPLES 1-2) Cell lines [00194] The C57BL/6 syngeneic TC-1 tumor was immortalized with HPV-16 E6 and E7 and transformed with the c-Ha-ras oncogene. TC-1, provided by T. C. Wu (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) is a highly tumorigenic lung epithelial cell expressing low levels of with HPV-16 E6 and E7 and transformed with the c-Ha-ras oncogene. TC-1 was grown in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, 100 Î¼Î nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 micromolar (mcM) 2-ME, 400 microgram (mcg)/ml G418, and 10% National Collection Type Culture-109 medium at 37Â° with 10% C02. C3 is a mouse embryo cell from C57BL/6 mice immortalized with the complete genome of HPV 16 and transformed with pEJ- ras. EL-4/E7 is the thymoma EL-4 retrovirally transduced with E7. L. monocytogenes strains and propagation [00195] Listeria strains used were Lm-LLO-E7 (hly-E7 fusion gene in an episomal expression system; Figure 1A), Lm-E7 (single-copy E7 gene cassette integrated into Listeria genome), Lm-LLO-NP ("DP-L2028"; hly-NP fusion gene in an episomal expression system), and Lm- Gag ("ZY-18"; single-copy HIV-1 Gag gene cassette integrated into the chromosome). E7 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5'-GGCTCGAGCATGGAGATACACC-3' (SEQ ID No: 17; Xhol site is underlined) and 5'-GGGGACTAGTTTATGGTTTCTGAGAACA-3' (SEQ ID No: 18; Spel site is underlined) and ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). E7 was excised from pCR2.1 by Xhol/ Spel digestion and ligated into pGG-55. The hly- E7 fusion gene and the pluripotential transcription factor prfA were cloned into pAM401 , a multicopy shuttle plasmid (Wirth R et al, J Bacterid, 165: 831, 1986), generating pGG-55. The hly promoter drives the expression of the first 441 AA of the hly gene product, (lacking the hemolytic C-terminus, referred to below as "ALLO," and having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID No: 25), which is joined by the Xhol site to the E7 gene, yielding a hly-E7 fusion gene that is transcribed and secreted as LLO-E7. Transformation of a prfA negative strain of Listeria, XFL-7 (provided by Dr. Hao Shen, University of Pennsylvania), with pGG-55 selected for the retention of the plasmid in vivo (Figures 1A-B). The hly promoter and gene fragment were generated using primers 5'- GGGGGCTAGCCCTCCTTTGATTAGTATATTC-3' (SEQ ID No: 19; Nhel site is underlined) and 5'-CTCCCTCGAGATCATAATTTACTTCATC-3' (SEQ ID No: 20; Xhol site is underlined). The prfA gene was PCR amplified using primers 5'- GACTACAAGGACGATGACCGACAAGTGATAACCCGGGATCTAAATAAATCCGTTT -3' (SEQ ID No: 27; Xbal site is underlined) and 5'- CCCGTCGACCAGCTCTTCTTGGTGAAG-3' (SEQ ID No: 21 ; Sail site is underlined). Lm- E7 was generated by introducing an expression cassette containing the hly promoter and signal sequence driving the expression and secretion of E7 into the orfZ domain of the LM genome. E7 was amplified by PCR using the primers 5'- GCGGATCCCATGGAGATACACCTAC-3' (SEQ ID No: 22; BamHI site is underlined) and 5'-GCTCTAGATTATGGTTTCTGAG-3' (SEQ ID No: 23; Xbal site is underlined). E7 was then ligated into the pZY-21 shuttle vector. LM strain 10403S was transformed with the resulting plasmid, pZY-21-E7, which includes an expression cassette inserted in the middle of a 1.6-kb sequence that corresponds to the orfX, Y, Z domain of the LM genome. The homology domain allows for insertion of the E7 gene cassette into the orfZ domain by homologous recombination. Clones were screened for integration of the E7 gene cassette into the orfZ domain. Bacteria were grown in brain heart infusion medium with (Lm-LLO-E7 and Lm-LLO-NP) or without (Lm-E7 and ZY-18) chloramphenicol (20 Î¼g/ml). Bacteria were frozen in aliquots at -80Â°C. Expression was verified by Western blotting (Figure 2). Western blotting [00196] Listeria strains were grown in Luria-Bertoni medium at 37Â°C and were harvested at the same optical density measured at 600 nm. The supernatants were TCA precipitated and resuspended in lx sample buffer supplemented with 0.1 N NaOH. Identical amounts of each cell pellet or each TCA-precipitated supernatant were loaded on 4-20% Tris-glycine SDS- PAGE gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). The gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and probed with an anti-E7 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, U.K.), developed with Amersham ECL detection reagents, and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Measurement of tumor growth [00197] Tumors were measured every other day with calipers spanning the shortest and longest surface diameters. The mean of these two measurements was plotted as the mean tumor diameter in millimeters against various time points. Mice were sacrificed when the tumor diameter reached 20 mm. Tumor measurements for each time point are shown only for surviving mice. Effects of Listeria recombinants on established tumor growth [00198] Six- to 8-wk-old C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) received 2 x 105 TC-1 cells s.c. on the left flank. One week following tumor inoculation, the tumors had reached a palpable size of 4-5 mm in diameter. Groups of eight mice were then treated with 0.1 LD50 i.p. Lm-LLO-E7 (107 CFU), Lm- E7 (106 CFU), Lm-LLO-NP (107 CFU), or Lm-Gag (5 x 105 CFU) on days 7 and 14. 51 Cr release assay [00199] C57BL/6 mice, 6-8 wk old, were immunized i.p. with O. ILD50 Lm-LLO-E7, Lm-E7, Lm-LLO-NP, or Lm-Gag. Ten days post-immunization, spleens were harvested. Splenocytes were established in culture with irradiated TC-1 cells (100: 1, splenocytes :TC-1) as feeder cells; stimulated in vitro for 5 days, then used in a standard 51Cr release assay, using the following targets: EL-4, EL-4/E7, or EL-4 pulsed with E7 H-2b peptide (RAHYNIVTF). E:T cell ratios, performed in triplicate, were 80: 1, 40: 1, 20: 1, 10: 1, 5: 1 , and 2.5:1. Following a 4-h incubation at 37Â°C, cells were pelleted, and 50 Î¼Î supernatant was removed from each well. Samples were assayed with a Wallac 1450 scintillation counter (Gaithersburg, MD). The percent specific lysis was determined as [(experimental counts per minute (cpm)- spontaneous cpm)/(total cpm - spontaneous cpm)] x 100. TC-1 -specific proliferation [00200] C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 0.1 LD50 and boosted by i.p. injection 20 days later with 1 LD50 Lm-LLO-E7, Lm-E7, Lm-LLO-NP, or Lm-Gag. Six days after boosting, spleens were harvested from immunized and naive mice. Splenocytes were established in culture at 5 x 105/well in flat-bottom 96- well plates with 2.5 x 104, 1.25 x 104, 6 x 103, or 3 x 103 irradiated TC-1 cells/well as a source of E7 Ag, or without TC-1 cells or with 10 Î¼g/ml Con A. Cells were pulsed 45 h later with 0.5 Î¼Î¸ [3H]thymidine/well. Plates were harvested 18 h later using a Tomtec harvester 96 (Orange, CT), and proliferation was assessed with a Wallac 1450 scintillation counter. The change in cpm was calculated as experimental cpm - no Ag cpm. Flow cytometric analysis [00201] C57BL/6 mice were immunized intravenously (i.v.) with 0.1 LD50 Lm-LLO-E7 or Lm-E7 and boosted 30 days later. Three-color flow cytometry for CD8 (53-6.7, PE conjugated), CD62 ligand (CD62L; MEL- 14, APC conjugated), and E7 H-2Db tetramer was performed using a FACSCaliburÂ® flow cytometer with CellQuestÂ® software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Splenocytes harvested 5 days after the boost were stained at room temperature (rt) with H-2Db tetramers loaded with the E7 peptide (RAHYNIVTF) or a control (HIV-Gag) peptide. Tetramers were used at a 1/200 dilution and were provided by Dr. Larry R. Pease (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and by the NIAID Tetramer Core Facility and the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Tetramer+, CD8+, CD62Llow cells were analyzed. B16F0-Ova experiment [00202] 24 C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 5 x 105 B16F0-Ova cells. On days 3, 10 and 17, groups of 8 mice were immunized with 0.1 LD50 Lm-OVA (106 cfu), Lm-LLO-OVA (108 cfu) and eight animals were left untreated. Statistics [00203] For comparisons of tumor diameters, mean and SD of tumor size for each group were determined, and statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS [00204] Lm-E7 and Lm-LLO-E7 were compared for their abilities to impact on TC-1 growth. Subcutaneous tumors were established on the left flank of C57BL/6 mice. Seven days later tumors had reached a palpable size (4-5 mm). Mice were vaccinated on days 7 and 14 with 0.1 LD50 Lm-E7, Lm-LLO-E7, or, as controls, Lm-Gag and Lm-LLO-NP. Lm-LLO-E7 induced complete regression of 75% of established TC-1 tumors, while tumor growth was controlled in the other 2 mice in the group (Figure 3). By contrast, immunization with Lm-E7 and Lm-Gag did not induce tumor regression. This experiment was repeated multiple times, always with very similar results. In addition, similar results were achieved for Lm-LLO-E7 under different immunization protocols. In another experiment, a single immunization was able to cure mice of established 5 mm TC-1 tumors. [00205] In other experiments, similar results were obtained with 2 other E7-expressing tumor cell lines: C3 and EL-4/E7. To confirm the efficacy of vaccination with Lm-LLO-E7, animals that had eliminated their tumors were re-challenged with TC-1 or EL-4/E7 tumor cells on day 60 or day 40, respectively. Animals immunized with Lm-LLO-E7 remained tumor free until termination of the experiment (day 124 in the case of TC-1 and day 54 for EL-4/E7). [00206] Thus, expression of an antigen as a fusion protein with ALLO enhances the immunogenicity of the antigen. EXAMPLE 2: LM-LLO-E7 TREATMENT ELICITS TC-1 SPECIFIC SPLENOCYTE PROLIFERATION [00207] To measure induction of T cells by Lm-E7 with Lm-LLO-E7, TC-l-specific proliferative responses, a measure of antigen- specific immunocompetence, were measured in immunized mice. Splenocytes from Lm-LLO-E7-immunized mice proliferated when exposed to irradiated TC-1 cells as a source of E7, at splenocyte: TC-1 ratios of 20:1, 40:1, 80:1, and 160:1 (Figure 4). Conversely, splenocytes from Lm-E7 and rLm control-immunized mice exhibited only background levels of proliferation. EXAMPLE 3: FUSION OF E7 TO LLP, ActA, OR A PEST AMINO ACID SEQUENCE ENHANCES E7-SPECIFIC IMMUNITY AND GENERATES TUMOR-INFILTRATING E7-SPECIFIC CD8+ CELLS MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS [00208] 500 mcl (microliter) of MATRIGELÂ®, comprising 100 mcl of 2 x 105 TC-1 tumor cells in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 400 mcl of MATRIGELÂ® (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) were implanted subcutaneously on the left flank of 12 C57BL/6 mice (n=3). Mice were immunized intraperitoneally on day 7, 14 and 21, and spleens and tumors were harvested on day 28. Tumor MATRIGELs were removed from the mice and incubated at 4 Â°C overnight in tubes containing 2 milliliters (ml) of RP 10 medium on ice. Tumors were minced with forceps, cut into 2 mm blocks, and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 hour with 3 ml of enzyme mixture (0.2 mg/ml collagenase-P, 1 mg/ml DNAse-1 in PBS). The tissue suspension was filtered through nylon mesh and washed with 5% fetal bovine serum + 0.05% of NaN3 in PBS for tetramer and IFN-gamma staining. [00209] Splenocytes and tumor cells were incubated with 1 micromole (mem) E7 peptide for 5 hours in the presence of brefeldin A at 107 cells/ml. Cells were washed twice and incubated in 50 mcl of anti-mouse Fc receptor supernatant (2.4 G2) for 1 hour or overnight at 4 Â°C. Cells were stained for surface molecules CD8 and CD62L, permeabilized, fixed using the permeabilization kit Golgi-stopÂ® or Golgi-PlugÂ® (Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.), and stained for IFN-gamma. 500,000 events were acquired using two-laser flow cytometer FACSCalibur and analyzed using Cellquest Software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Percentages of IFN-gamma secreting cells within the activated (CD62Llow) CD8+ T cells were calculated. [00210] For tetramer staining, H-2Db tetramer was loaded with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated E7 peptide (RAHYNIVTF, SEQ ID NO: 24), stained at rt for 1 hour, and stained with anti- allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated MEL- 14 (CD62L) and FITC-conjugated CD8+ at 4 Â°C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed comparing tetramer+CD8+ CD62Llow cells in the spleen and in the tumor. RESULTS [00211] To analyze the ability of Lm-ActA-E7 to enhance antigen specific immunity, mice were implanted with TC-1 tumor cells and immunized with either Lm-LLO-E7 (1 x 107 CFU), Lm-E7 (1 x 106 CFU), or Lm-ActA-E7 (2 x 108 CFU), or were untreated (naive). Tumors of mice from the Lm-LLO-E7 and Lm-ActA-E7 groups contained a higher percentage of IFN- gamma- secreting CD8+ T cells (Figure 5A) and tetramer- specific CD8+ cells (Figure 5B) than in Lm-E7 or naive mice. [00212] In another experiment, tumor-bearing mice were administered Lm-LLO-E7, Lm- PEST-E7, Lm-APEST-E7, or Lm-E7epi, and levels of E7-specific lymphocytes within the tumor were measured. Mice were treated on days 7 and 14 with 0.1 LD50 of the 4 vaccines. Tumors were harvested on day 21 and stained with antibodies to CD62L, CD8, and with the E7/Db tetramer. An increased percentage of tetramer-positive lymphocytes within the tumor were seen in mice vaccinated with Lm-LLO-E7 and Lm-PEST-E7 (Figure 6A). This result was reproducible over three experiments (Figure 6B). [00213] Thus, Lm-LLO-E7, Lm-ActA-E7, and Lm-PEST-E7 are each efficacious at induction of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and tumor regression. EXAMPLE 4: PASSAGING OF LISTERIA VACCINE VECTORS THROUGH MICE ELICITS INCREASED IMMUNE RESPONSES TO HETEROLOGOUS AND ENDOGENOUS ANTIGENS MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Bacterial Strains [00214] L. monocytogenes strain 10403S, serotype 1 (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) was the wild type organism used in these studies and the parental strain of the constructs described below. Strain 10403S has an LD50 of approximately 5 x 104 CFU when injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice. "Lm-Gag" is a recombinant LM strain containing a copy of the HIV-1 strain HXB (subtype B laboratory strain with a syncytia-forming phenotype) gag gene stably integrated into the Listeria} chromosome using a modified shuttle vector pKSV7. Gag protein was expressed and secreted by the strain, as determined by Western blot. All strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth or agar plates (Difco Labs, Detroit, Mich). Bacterial Culture [00215] Bacteria from a single clone expressing the passenger antigen and/or fusion protein were selected and cultured in BHI broth overnight. Aliquots of this culture were frozen at " 70Â°C with no additives. From this stock, cultures were grown to 0.1-0.2 O.D. at 600 nm, and aliquots were again frozen at -70Â°C with no additives. To prepare cloned bacterial pools, the above procedure was used, but after each passage a number of bacterial clones were selected and checked for expression of the target antigen, as described herein. Clones in which expression of the foreign antigen was confirmed were used for the next passage. Passage of Bacteria in Mice [00216] 6-8 week old female BALB/c (H-2d) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me) and were maintained in a pathogen-free microisolator environment. The titer of viable bacteria in an aliquot of stock culture, stored frozen at -70 Â°C, was determined by plating on BHI agar plates on thawing and prior to use. In all, 5 x 105 bacteria were injected intravenously into BALB/c mice. After 3 days, spleens were harvested, homogenized, and serial dilutions of the spleen homogenate were incubated in BHI broth overnight and plated on BHI agar plates. For further passage, aliquots were again grown to 0.1-0.2 O.D., frozen at -70 Â°C, and bacterial titer was again determined by serial dilution. After the initial passage (passage 0), this sequence was repeated for a total of 4 times. Intracellular Cytokine Stain for IFN-Gamma [00217] Lymphocytes were cultured for 5 hours in complete RPMI-10 medium supplemented with 50 U/ml human recombinant IL-2 and 1 microliter/ml Brefeldin A (Golgistopâ¢; PharMingen, San Diego, CA) in the presence or absence of either the cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) epitope for HIV-GAG (AMQMLKETI; SEQ ID No: 25), Listeria LLO (GYKDGNEYI; SEQ ID No: 26) or the HPV virus gene E7 (RAHYNIVTF) (SEQ ID No: 24), at a concentration of 1 micromole. Cells were first surface-stained, then washed and subjected to intracellular cytokine stain using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). For intracellular IFN-gamma stain, FITC- conjugated rat anti-mouse IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody (clone XMG 1.2) and its isotype control Ab (rat IgGl ; both from PharMingen) was used. In all, 106 cells were stained in PBS containing 1 % Bovine Serum Albumin and 0.02% sodium azide (FACS Buffer) for 30 minutes at 4 Â°C. followed by 3 washes in FACS buffer. Sample data were acquired on either a FACScanâ¢ flowcytometer or FACSCaliburâ¢ instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Three-color flow cytometry for CD8 (PERCP conjugated, rat anti-mouse, clone 53-6.7 Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.), CD62L (APC conjugated, rat anti-mouse, clone MEL-14), and intracellular IFN-gamma was performed using a FACSCaliburâ¢ flow cytometer, and data were further analyzed with CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells were gated on CD8 high and CD62Llow before they were analyzed for CD8+ and intracellular IFN-gamma staining. RESULTS Passa2in2 in Mice Increases the Virulence of Recombinant Listeria Monocvto2enes [00218] Three different constructs were used to determine the impact of passaging on recombinant Listeria vaccine vectors. Two of these constructs carry a genomic insertion of the passenger antigen: the first comprises the HIV gag gene (Lm-Gag), and the second comprises the HPV E7 gene (Lm-E7). The third (Lm-LLO-E7) comprises a plasmid with the fusion gene for the passenger antigen (HPV E7) fused with a truncated version of LLO and a gene encoding prfA, the positive regulatory factor that controls Listeria virulence factors. This plasmid was used to complement a prfA negative mutant so that in a live host, selection pressures would favor conservation of the plasmid, because without it the bacterium is avirulent. All 3 constructs had been propagated extensively in vitro for many bacterial generations. [00219] Passaging the bacteria resulted in an increase in bacterial virulence, as measured by numbers of surviving bacteria in the spleen, with each of the first 2 passages. For Lm-Gag and Lm-LLO-E7, virulence increased with each passage up to passage 2 (Figure 7A). The plasmid-containing construct, Lm-LLO-E7, demonstrated the most dramatic increase in virulence. Prior to passage, the initial immunizing dose of Lm-LLO-E7 had to be increased to 107 bacteria and the spleen had to be harvested on day 2 in order to recover bacteria (whereas an initial dose of 105 bacteria for Lm-Gag was harvested on day 3). After the initial passage, the standard dosage of Lm-LLO-E7 was sufficient to allow harvesting on day 3. For Lm-E7, virulence increased by 1.5 orders of magnitude over unpassaged bacteria (Figure 7B). [00220] Thus, passage through mice increases the virulence of Listeria vaccine strains. Passaging Increases the Ability of L. monocytogenes to Induce CD8+ T Cells [00221] Next, the effect of passaging on induction of antigen- specific CD8+ T cells was determined by intracellular cytokine staining with immunodominant peptides specific for MHC-class I using HIV-Gag peptide AMQMLKETI (SEQ ID No: 25) and LLO 91-99 (GYKDGNEYI; SEQ ID No: 26). Injection of 103 CFU passaged bacteria (Lm-Gag) into mice elicited significant numbers of HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells, while the same dose of non-passaged Lm-Gag induced no detectable Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. Even increasing the dose of unpassaged bacteria 100-fold did not compensate for their relative avirulence; in fact, no detectable Gag-specific CD8+ T cells were elicited even at the higher dose. The same dose increase with passaged bacteria increased Gag-specific T cell induction by 50% (Figure 8). The same pattern of induction of antigen- specific CD8+ T cells was observed with LLO- specific CD8+ T cells, showing that these results were not caused by the properties of the passenger antigen, since they were observed with LLO, an endogenous Listeria antigen. [00222] Thus, passage through mice increases the immunogenicity of Listeria vaccine strains. EXAMPLE 5: A PrfA-CONTAINING PLASMID IS STABLE IN AN LM STRAIN WITH A PrfA DELETION IN THE ABSENCE OF ANTIBIOTICS MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Bacteria [00223] L. monocytogenes strain XFL7 contains a 300 base pair deletion in the prfA gene XFL7 carries pGG55 which partially restores virulence and confers CAP resistance, and is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 200500118184. Development of protocol for plasmid extraction from Listeria [00224] 1 mL of Listeria monocytogenes Lm-LLO-E7 research working cell bank vial was inoculated into 27 mL BH1 medium containing 34 Î¼g/mL CAP and grown for 24 hours at 37 Â°C and 200 rpm. [00225] Seven 2.5 mL samples of the culture were pelleted (15000 rpm for 5 minutes), and pellets were incubated at 37 Â°C with 50 Î¼Î lysozyme solution for varying amounts of time, from 0-60 minutes. [00226] Lysozyme solution: - 29 Î¼Î 1 M dibasic Potassium Phosphate - 21 Î¼Î 1 M monobasic Potassium Phosphate - 500 Î¼Î 40% Sucrose (filter sterilized through 0.45 /Î¼Î¹Î· filter) - 450 Î¼Î water - 60 Î¼Î lysozyme (50 mg/mL) [00227] After incubation with the lysozyme, the suspensions were centrifuged as before and the supernatants discarded. Each pellet was then subjected to plasmid extraction by a modified version of the QIAprep Spin Miniprep KitÂ® (Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland) protocol. The changes to the protocol were as follows: 1. The volumes of buffers PI, P2 and N3 were all increased threefold to allow complete lysis of the increased biomass. 2. 2 mg/mL of lysozyme was added to the resuspended cells before the addition of P2. The lysis solution was then incubated at 37Â°C for 15 minutes before neutralization. 3. The plasmid DNA was resuspended in 30 Î¼Î rather than 50 Î¼Î to increase the concentration. [00228] In other experiments, the cells were incubated for 15min in PI buffer + Lysozyme, then incubated with P2 (lysis buffer) and P3 (neutraliztion buffer) at room temperature. [00229] Equal volumes of the isolated plasmid DNA from each subculture were run on an 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized for any signs of structural or segregation instability. [00230] The results showed that plasmid extraction from L. monocytogenes Lm-LLO-E7 increases in efficiency with increasing incubation time with lysozyme, up to an optimum level at approximately 50 minutes incubation. [00231] These results provide an effective method for plasmid extraction from Listeria vaccine strains. Replica plating [00232] Dilutions of the original culture were plated onto plates containing LB or TB agar in the absence or presence of 34 Î¼g/mL CAP. The differences between the counts on selective and non-selective agar were used to determine whether there was any gross segregational instability of the plasmid. RESULTS [00233] The genetic stability (i.e. the extent to which the plasmid is retained by or remains stably associated with the bacteria in the absence of selection pressure; e.g. antibiotic selection pressure) of the pGG55 plasmid in L. monocytogenes strain XFL7 in the absence of antibiotic was assessed by serial sub-culture in both Luria-Bertani media (LB: 5 g/L NaCl, 10 g/ml soy peptone, 5 g/L yeast extract) and Terrific Broth media (TB: 10 g/L glucose, 11.8 g/L soy peptone, 23.6 g/L yeast extract, 2.2 g/L KH2P04, 9.4 g/L K2HP04), in duplicate cultures. 50 mL of fresh media in a 250 mL baffled shake flask was inoculated with a fixed number of cells (1 ODmL), which was then subcultured at 24 hour intervals. Cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker at 37 Â°C and 200 rpm. At each subculture the OD6oo was measured and used to calculate the cell doubling time (or generation) elapsed, until 30 generations were reached in LB and 42 in TB. A known number of cells (15 OD mL) at each subculture stage (approximately every 4 generations) were pelleted by centrifugation, and the plasmid DNA was extracted using the Qiagen QIAprep Spin MiniprepÂ® protocol described above. After purification, plasmid DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by ethidium bromide staining. While the amount of plasmid in the preps varied slightly between samples, the overall trend was a constant amount of plasmid with respect to the generational number of the bacteria (Figures 9A-B). Thus, pGG55 exhibited stability in strain XFL7, even in the absence of antibiotic. [00234] Plasmid stability was also monitored during the stability study by replica plating on agar plates at each stage of the subculture. Consistent with the results from the agarose gel electrophoresis, there was no overall change in the number of plasmid-containing cells throughout the study in either LB or TB liquid culture (Figures 10 and 11, respectively). [00235] These findings demonstrate that prfA-encoding plasmids exhibit stability in the absence of antibiotic in Listeria strains containing mutations in prfA. MATERIALS AND METHODS (examples 6-10) [00236] PCR reagents: [00237] The primers used for amplification of the prfA gene and discrimination of the D133V mutation are shown in Table 1. Stock solutions of the primers ADV451, 452 and 453 were prepared by diluting the primers in TE buffer to 400 Î¼Î. An aliquot of the stock solution was further diluted to 20Î¼Î in water (PCR grade) to prepare a working solution. Primers were stored at -20Â°C. The reagents used in the PCR are shown in Table 2.

For plasmid purification from Listeria, bacterial strains carrying the pGG55 D133V or WT plasmids were streak plated from frozen stocks in BHI agar plates supplemented with chloramphenicol (25 Î¼g/ml). A single colony from each strain was grown in 5 ml of selective medium (BHI broth with 25 Î¼g/ml of chloramphenicol) for 6 hours with vigorous shaking at 37Â°C and subinoculated 1 :500 in 100 ml of selective medium for overnight growth under similar conditions. Bacteria from the overnight culture were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 minutes and resuspended buffer R3 (resuspension buffer) containing 2 mg/ml of lysozyme (Sigma, L7001). The bacteria suspension was incubated for at least 1 hour at 37 Â°C before proceeding to the regular protocol. Concentration and purity of the eluted plasmids were measured in a spectrophotometer at 260nm and 280nm. To prepare the template DNAs, the pGG55 D133V and WT plasmids were resuspended in water to a final concentration of 1 ng/Î¼Î from the midiprep stock solution. For the pGG55 WT plasmid, serial 10-fold dilutions from the 1 ng/Î¼Î solution were prepared, corresponding to dilutions from 10"1 to 10"7. prfA specific PCR protocol to test clinical grade material [00241] The reaction mixture contained lx PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM dNTPs, 0.4 Î¼Î of each primer, 0.05 U/Î¼Î of Taq DNA polymerase and 0.04 ng/Î¼Î of the pGG55 D133V template plasmid. For each test, 10 tubes were required and the key components in each tube in a 25 Î¼Î reaction are shown in the Table 3. For the PCR reaction, a master mix was prepared with enough reagents for 11 reactions as shown in Table 4, and 24 Î¼Î of this PCR mix was added to each tube. Subsequently, a total of 1 Î¼Î of the serially diluted pGG55 WT plasmid was added to the corresponding tubes: 1 ng in tube 3; 100 pg in tube 4; 10 pg in tube 5; 1 pg in tube 6; 100 fg in tube 7; 10 fg in tube 8; 1 fg in tube 9; 0.1 fg in tube 10. This serial dilution was used to calibrate a standard curve to determine the method sensitivity. Additionally, 0.5 Î¼Î of water and 0.5 Î¼Î of primer ADV451 (20 Î¼Î stock) were added in tube 1, and 1 Î¼Î of water added in tube 2, completing 25 Î¼Î of final volume. The quantities of each reagent per tube for a 25 Î¼Î reaction are shown in Table 5. The PCR cycling conditions used in the reaction are shown in Table 6. [00242] After conclusion of the PCR reaction, 5 Î¼Î of gel-loading buffer (6x, with bromophenol blue) was added to each sample and 10 Î¼Î were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gel in TBE buffer. The gel dimensions were 7 cm x 7 cm x 1 cm with a 15 sample wells (1 mm x 2 mm) comb. The gel was run at 100 V for -30 minutes, until the bromophenol blue dye reached the middle of the gel. The gel was stained in ethidium bromide (0.5 Î¼g/ml) for 20 minutes, destaining in water for 10 minutes. The gel is visualized by illumination with UV light and photographed. The image was analyzed using a band densitometry software (Quantity One version 4.5.1, BioRad). [00243] Table 3.

The plasmids pGG55 D133V and pGG55 WT were mixed at different ratios (1 : 1 , 1 : 10, 1 ; 100, 1 :1 ,000 and 1 : 10,000). The total amount of plasmid in the mixture was kept constant (500 Î¼g) and the plasmid containing the wild- type sequence was 10-fold serially diluted in relation to the D133V plasmid to determine the sensitivity of the method. RESULTS EXAMPLE 6: SEQUENCING IS NOT A SENSITIVE METHOD TO DETECT THE REVERSION OF THE D133V MUTATION. [00248] To estimate the sensitivity of sequencing in detecting the wild-type prfA sequence, the pGG55 D133V and WT plasmids were mixed at the different ratios and sequenced. The results are shown in Figure 12 and reveal that sequencing has a high specificity in discriminating the prfA D133V mutation (Figure 12). On the other hand, the sensitivity is low and the maximum dilution of wild- type prfA pGG55 plasmid with a detectable peak in the sequence was 1 in 10 (Figure 12). In conclusion, although sequencing is very specific, the sensitivity of the method is low and not appropriate to screen for the presence of rare events such as revertants of the prfA D133V mutation in Lm-LLO-E7 samples. EXAMPLE 7: DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND SENSITIVE PCR METHOD TO DETECT REVERSION OF THE D133V MUTATION. [00249] Given the low sensitivity of sequencing to detect rare events, it became imperative to develop a more sensitive method with similar specificity to detect reversion of the D133V mutation to wild-type. To achieve this goal, we designed a PCR-based method that specifically amplifies the wild-type sequence and is sensitive enough to detect at least 1 wild- type copy of prfA in 10,000,000 copies of the D133V mutated sequence. We designed 3 primers for this method: ADV451, ADV452 and ADV453 (Table 1). Both ADV451 and ADV452 are forward primers and differ in the last nucleotide at the 3' position to discriminate the AâT (D133V) mutation at position 398 of the prfA gene. The ADV453 primer is the reverse primer located approximately 300 bp downstream the annealing site of the ADV451 and ADV452 primers (Figure 13). The expected PCR band obtained with the primers ADV451 or ADV452 and ADV453 is 326 bp. Under stringent conditions, the ADV451 primer should only amplify the pGG55 D133V plasmid, whereas the ADV452 would be specific to the wild-type prfA sequence.

[00250] The reaction using the primer ADV451 was very specific and amplified the mutated D133V prfA sequence (lanes 1 to 3), but not the wild-type sequence (lanes 4 to 6). However, a very faint band can be detected in lane 4, when 5 ng of template DNA was used, but not with 1 ng (Figure 14). [00251] As shown in Figure 15, the reaction with the ADV452 primer only amplified the wild- type prfA sequence (lanes 4, 5 and 6), and no bands were detected when the pGG55 carrying the D133V prfA mutation was used as a template (lanes 1, 2 and 3), even when using 5 ng of plasmid in the reaction (Figure 16). In conclusion, the PCR reactions with primers ADV451 and ADV452 are very specific and able to discriminate the A<âT (D133V) mutation at position 398 of the prfA gene in the pGG55 plasmid. Based on these results, we selected the amount of 1 ng as the standard amount of template DNA to be used in the reaction. EXAMPLE 9: SENSITIVITY OF THE PCR METHOD. [00252] The sensitivity of the reaction was tested using 1 ng of template DNA. For the plasmid carrying the wild- type prfA sequence, decreasing amounts of DNA (corresponding to 10-fold dilutions from 10"1 to 10"7), were also included in the reaction to estimate the sensitivity. In these reactions only the primers ADV452 and ADV453 were used. In a PCR reaction with 30 cycles (10 cycles with annealing temperature of 53Â°C and an additional 20 cycles with annealing temperature of 50Â°C), the sensitivity of the method was 1 in 100,000 (data not shown). As shown in figure 5, increasing the number of PCR cycles to 37 improved the visual sensitivity of the method to 10"6 for the detection of D133V revertants, without significantly compromising the specificity. A clear band was visible at the 10"6 dilution, corresponding to a detection level of 1 copy of the wild-type sequence in a million of the D133V mutant, when 1 ng of plasmid was used as the initial amount of DNA. Only a very weak band can be visualized in lanes 1 and 9 after longer exposure, reassuring the robust specificity of the method. On the other hand, when starting with 5 ng of DNA, a band could be easily detected at the 10"7 dilution, increasing the sensitivity of the PCR. However, a similar band in intensity could also be detected with the pGG55 D133V plasmid, indicating the specificity limit of the method (Figure 17). This band observed with the pGG55 D133V plasmid is likely due to nonspecific amplification of the D133V mutation with primer ADV452 that can significantly accumulate with the increased number of cycles. These results indicate that the sensitivity limit for this method, without significantly compromising the specificity, is situated between 1 to 1,000,000 and 1 to 10,000,000. EXAMPLE 10: RECOMBINANT LISTERIA EXPRESSING A FUSION PROTEIN OF LLO TO E7 (LM-LLO-E7) [00253] This strain is approx. 4 -5 logs more attenuated than the wild-type parent strain 10403S and secretes the fusion protein tLLO-E7. This immunotherapy is based on the backbone XFL7, which is derived from 10403S by the irreversible deletion in the virulence gene transcription activator prfA. PrfA regulates the transcription of several virulence genes such as Listeriolysin O (LLO), ActA, PlcA (phospholipase A), PlcB (phospholipase B) etc that are required for in vivo intracellular growth and survival of L. monocytogenes. The plasmid pGG55 is retained by the Lm-LLO-E7 in vitro by means of selection with 'chloramphenicol' . However for in vivo retention of the plasmid by Lm-LLO-E7, it carries a copy of mutated prfA (D133V), which has been demonstrated to be less active than wild-type PrfA in DNA binding and activating the transcription of virulence genes. We have observed that complementation with mutated prfA resulted in approx. 40 fold reduction in the amount of secreted LLO from Lm-LLO-E7 when compared to wild- type strain 10403S. This implicates that the strain Lm-LLO-E7 likely exhibits a reduced expression of the virulence genes that are regulated by PrfA such as actA, inlA, MB, inlC, plcB etc. In Lm-LLO-E7, the complementation with mutated copy of prfA likely causes a reduction in the expression of different virulence genes that are regulated by PrfA resulting in overall attenuation of approx. 4-5 logs.
