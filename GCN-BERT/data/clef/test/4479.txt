i :- ï: :' !:• i» iíl) i " •. .... TO ALL OM IT MAY CONCERN: Be it known that I, Edgard Camille DeSmet,of the City of St. 0loud, in the County of Stearns, and State of Minnesota, United States of America, Engineer, have invented certain new and useful improvements in COLLAPSIBLE FOOT-RESTS of which the following is a description, reference being had to the accompanying drawing, which forms a part of my specification. ï. My invention relates to a collapsible foot-test or support more especially intended for use in connection with automobiles of the type wherein the front seat back is adapted to be swung into a reclíning position and in conjunction with the rear seat form a couch, when the rest or support is intended to be brought into "set up't or supporting position forward of the front seat. The object of my invention is to provide a rest or support which may be readily secured to the cross-rail or underframe of the front seat, namely to the front part of the underframe at a point beneath the cushion, and which is adapted to collapse or be folded into inoperative position beneath the front seat cushion when not in use; while at the same time may be readily unfolded or opened out when the cushion is moved out of the way and will remain in "set up" position and be supported by the seat underframe. While my improved construction is more espe jal- ç«, .I • •. / .... ii i ÷ ly intended as a foot-test or support for use as above statea, the invention may be differently employed, as for example as an auxiliary seat, bF simply securing it in place in a slightly different manner so that the unfolding of the rest or support will not interfer with the usual arrangement of the seats or cushions of the automobile. The objects of my invention and its advantages will be more full comprehended from the detailed description of the accompanying drawing, wherein:- Figure 1 is a side elevation of my improved rest or support shown applied to the supporting rail or underframe of the front seat or cushion of an automobile; the rest or support being shown in extended or unfolded position, while the cushion and front seat-back are shown arranged so as to constitute a couch. figure 2 is a perspective view of m improvement on an enlarged scale, showing the rest secured to a supporting rail or unde frame and in unfolded condition; the folded condition of the nemr side of the rest being shown in dotted lines. i'i AS previously stated, my invention is more especially intended for use in an automobile wherein the front seat-back, shown at 10, is pivotally secured at ll so as to permit it to be swung down into a horizontal or reclining position as shown, and thus enable the front seat cushion 12 to be moved back slightly beyond its supporting structure or underframe, shown at 13, whereby m improved rest or support ma be brought up into unfolded or "se u "Ç position as shown in full lines. In practice, the rest I or support is of such construction and so secured to the front rail or underframe l of the front-seat as to bring the top of the rest or support substantially in the same horizontal plan as the top of the cushion or seat 12. I believe the construction illustrated in the drawing to be the best embodiment and adaptation of my invention, but it is evident that the invention may have expression in somewhat different mechanical form without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. In the specific embodiment, the invention comprises a pair of similar metallic brackets or castings 14 adapted to be secured to the underframe or rail 13 of the front seat, as very clearly shown in Figure 2. Each bracket or casting 14 is provided with a pair of ears or lobes 15 and 16 arranged in spaced relation and preferably disposed from opposite edges of the casting or bracket as shown; that is, with the lobe or ear 15 formed integral with one edge or side of the casting or bracket 14 and arranged in a different horizontal and vertical plane from the lobe or ear 16 which is formed integral with the opposite edge or side of the casting or bracket 14. The lobe or ear 16 of each casting or bracket 14 is preferably disposed in an upwardly inclining direction and given slightly greater length than the lobe or ear 15 of each bracket, thus causing the lobes or ears 16 to extend into vertical planes farther removed from the main or..., body portion of the brackets and therefore slightly farther from the cross-rail or underframe 13 than lobes or ears ii :., • i •- « ii•!i i.' < !i iü::J Each lobe or ear 15 has a link 17 pivotally secured thereto at 18 so as to permit vertical movement; the links 17 being of predetermined length and secured together at their upper or free ends by means of a rod 19. Pivotally secured on both ends of the rod 19, which extends transversely of the rest and to the outside of links 17, are the links (one on each side of the foot-rest or support). The lower end of each link 20 is pivotally secured at 21 to a link 22 on the same side of the rest. The links 22 on each side of the foot-rest or support have their lower ends pivotally secured at 23 to their respective ears or lobes 16, while the outer or free ends are connected together by means of a suitable rod 24 disposed transversely of the foot-rest; the ends of the rod being swaged or otherwise secured in place against removal. The rods 19 and 24 provide attaching and supporting members for a suitable fabric or flexible material 25; the ends whereof are shown passed about the rods 19 and 24 and stitched or otherwise secured in place; the fabric being of such length as to be absolutely taut, as shown in the drawing, when the foot-rest or support is unfolded or n " set-up» position. The lobes or ears 15 and 16 are formed on the brackets or castings so as to be located beneath the horizontal plane of the top of the supporting frame or rail 13, il <.,M. ¢.:' -. "..' ' , so that when the foot-rest is opened out, the links 22 may bear on or rest against the upper portion of the casting which is disposed about the beveled portion of the crossrail or frame 13, as clearly shown, and thereby support ' the foot-rest in position somewhat forward of the seat underframe. The links 20 are pivotally secured to the I LI .ü'. lìnks 22 at a distance slightly forward of the pivotal connection of links 22 with brackets 14, namely preferably at a point coincident with the points where links 22 bear or rest on the castings or brackets 14; and as the links OE7 and 22 are somewhat spaced aparté by reason of the renation between lobes or ears 15 and 16 to which they are respectively secured, the links 20 are given a slight curvature or bend as disclosed in the drawing in order to permit links 20 to have free pivotal relation with both links 17 and 22. The pivotal point 23 of link 22 is disposed slightly rearward of the plane of pivotal point 18 of link 17; so that any collapsing movement or tendency of the links will be prevented when downward pressure is exerted on the fabric 25, because of the location of the pivotal points 2 slightly rearward of the longitudinal center line or axis of each link 17, that is to say,rearward of the base of a triangle formed by pivotal points 18, 21 and the end of rod 19. With my improved construction, ít has been found in practice that the fabric 'becomes slightly more taut or stretched beyond normal at a moment Just prior to the respective links assuming their maximum unfolded relation. The device or support may be readily brought into supportingor unfolded position by simply grasping the connecting rod 24 and causing the links 22 to swing upward from the position shown in dotted lines in jgure 2 through the arc of a circle into the position shown in full lines. Such upward pull on the rod 24 and links 22 /L will cause the links 17 and 20 to assume the relative positions disclosed in full lines, while links 22 may :: :..7. i!!ii rest on the cross-rail or brackets secured thereto. On the other hand, the rest or support ma be quickly collapsed or swung downward beneath the front seat onshíon into the position shown in dotted lines in Figure 2 b sufficient upward pressure on rod 24 which will cause the entire support, momentarily te swing about the pivotal points 18 and 23 until the pivotal points 25 are disposed in a position forward of the links 17, or at least forward of the longitudinal axìs of links 17, when the device will readily collapse into the folded position shown in dotted lines. In the particular exemplification of the inventlon, I have, for convenience and expense in manufacture, • shown the links CO poEvoted on the ends of the rod 19; it will be understood, however, that the pivotal connections of links 20 with links 17 need not be at the points shown, especially where the relation between the elements of the foot rest are somewhat altered; but the pivotal pooEnts for links 20 at their upper ends (when the rest is opened out!« will n most instances be located at the longitudinal center 1oEnes of links 17, but possible removed from the ends of rod 19. "í r i :.r, The supporting frames for the seat of automobiles, at least for the front seats of automobiles, are usually so formed as to provide a space or chamber beneath the seat proper, as shown in figure l, and provided with a top panel 26 which man be out away or kerfed, as shown in figure 1 to receive the rod 24 and prevent the rest or support from swinging down onto the floor of the automobile body and thus at the same time provide space therebeneath for other usage. --Õ-- i i: •i • Having shown and described what I believe to be I the best embodiment of my invention, w a I claim is:-- i?• i i¸ "i' •" • IL i//-i: •:i. ï.).. •.
