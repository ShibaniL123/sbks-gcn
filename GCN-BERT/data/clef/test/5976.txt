i000tl I Na',al continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP} has been used in the treatment ol respiratory ciistress m patients since the early i970s. NCPAP has been shown to help maintain functional residual capacity, improve oxygenation, prevent atelectasis, reduce upper airway resistance, improve lung cnmpliarrce, and distend or stabilize the airway, reducing or preventing apnoea. }( OOS}N ,,a C >minm)u', Po itwe Airway Pressure (NCPAP) is a well-known technique for providing respiratory Sul)port to parents with respiratory distress requiring very sensitive support than m r I',,mic..]l ventilation lO00(fllh,, b,INIL IlleLb,I IISlII in art consists ol attaching standard ventilator tubing to the head oI the l),Hu,m.

Conventional pressure devices include a canister having a very flexible lid with an aperture formed through the lid into which the conduit is positioned. These devices disadvantageously allow the movenrent and shift in pressure. Hence, there exists a need to have a stable NCPAP pressure r] 1 v 1 e. 1000,Sll, nrt. churn nxmttwo conventional means oF controlling the pressure in the NCPAP tubing. One t)f th(" ll)n%[ COllll]lOn methods is to uge a mechanical ventilator but its use increases wear and tear on the w-ntil tor, l he second nrethod s called "Nasal bubble CPAP" and one typical conventional prior art: sel-up for effecting it is shown in FIG. ]. According to the figure, the set up includes a supply of oxygen, mixing chamber, air supply, humidifier, ventilator tube, pair of nasal prongs, face mask. [0009] A nasal bubble continuous positive airway pressure system comprising pressure device having a canister, inspiratory tube coupled to a gas source for providing pressure into which a patient must exhale is well known in prior art, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. US2009056719A1. [0010] Similarly, an apparatus for controlling the pressure of gas by bubbling through a liquid, such as bubble CPAP is also well known in prior art, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. US2005072470AI, wherein; the apparatus is arranged for effecting respiratory support for a living being by nasal continuous positive airway pressure. In that application the proximal portion of the positionable tube arranged to be coupled to the downstream side of a pair of nasal prongs or a face mask, The pair of nasal prongs or face mask has an upstream side coupled to the source of gas. [0011] Accordingly, conventional cannula comprises of a single tube with a nozzle that is attached the oxygen flow meter and the other end of tube continues and bifurcates into two tubes that are joined together by the nasal prongs with an adjusting knob that can be used to adjust the circumference of bifurcating tubes to snugfily fit around patients' head with the nasal prongs inserted into patients nostrils. [0012] Accordingly, the conventional IV infusion set comprises of pointed nozzle at one end that inserted into IV fluid bottle wherein; the nozzle has a tubing that terminates into the Murphy's chamber with an exit tube from the Murphy's chamber that ends into a 5cm rubber tubing. At the other end of the 5 cm rubber tubing is attached a stiff plastic adapter that fits snuggly into the Intracath that has been placed into the patients vein: IO013]As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, use of bubble CPAP requires more trained sources, complex settings, high costs and thorouj h examination. Thus, there exists a need for a simplified NBCPAP device which is effective eve vithout complex structures like the humidifier, air oxygen blender, which is easy to assemble and which would be handled even by the nontechnical staff in case of temporary emergency requirement and where no complexity is involved as compared to CPAP via ventilators. [O014]Further, infants put on ventilation or on conventional NBCPAP systems strictly need to be on bed and also cannot be breastfed and therefore, there exists a need for a system where the system's working as well as feeding can be achieved simultaneously and where, the Infants can be on mother's lap while the system is working. [O01S]Furthermore, despite the benefits of NCPAP, however, research evidences have revealed that injuries to the nose may occur wheo NCPAP is administered for more than three days or chances of secondary infection may arise. These injuries can cause irreparable damage to the nasal structures. Hence a need for noninvasive technique using NSCPAP device is required, without causing necrosis of the nasal tissue or pain or negligible risk of secondary infection. [0016] Conventional BNCPAP systems or ventilators require continuous power supply or backup facility, but instant power failure may result in system failure, which may be detrimental to patient's life, hence there must be a system that has no health risk during system failure due to power cut problems. [0017] In case of hospitals where there are limited facilities and where use of large number of ventilators for emergency is not possible under heavy patient flow, there is a need for such a system that could be beneficial under emergency circumstances. Also, system should be such that, it benefits, if used by under-developed or least-developed countries, along with developing countries, where the facilities are less. (O018]Most of the times newly practicing doctors cannot operate the ventilators during emergency and therefore the system which may be easy to handle by doctors and nurses should exist. [0019]Many a times there is some kind of psychological discomfort in patients as well as the relatives while using CPAP via ventilators and the intensity of fear amongst them increases. Hence, there is a need for a simple CPAP device that would reduce the level of fear. [0020]Accordingly, a need exists for a nasal bubble device which overcomes all above disadvantages of the prior art and which turns out to be a viable alternative to a ventilator. [00211 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0022] One or more embodiments of the present invention are based on a device called a Nasal bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.

The kit comprising a circuit; said circuit involves a nasal bubble r ntinuous positive airway pressure system, comprising conventional oxygen source, commercially available pre-sterilized pediatric oxygen nasal cannula, rubber and plastic connector tubing, preferably, but not limited to pre-sterilized IV infusion set and liquid storage container, preferably, but n limited to pre-sterilized saline bottle. [0024JAnother aspect of the nasal bubble continuous positive airway pressure system in some embodiments comprises a conventional wall mounted oxygen flow meter to receive oxygen through pipes from the main oxygen bank, modified pediatric oxygen nasal cannula having a cut tube, wherein; the cut end on the side of the adjusting knob is sealed into a tight knot and taped with a sticking plaster to avoid oxygen leakage and the other cut end attached to rubber and plastic connector tubing, said modified connector tubing wherein; tube coming out of Murphy's chamber and plastic adapter at the end of rubber is cut from the. rubber tubing and discarded and the remaining tube with the rubber tubing is attached tO the said modified pediatric nasal cannula. [0025]Further aspect of the present invention, comprises an entire modified circuit wherein; the said rubber tubing end of the connector tubing is attached to the cut end of the said modified pediatric nasal cannula which is about 10 centimeter from the nasal prongs. The other end of the connector tubing is used to snuggly fit into the liquid storage container, preferably, but not limited to normal saline bottle ranging from S centimeter to 20 centimeter below the level of the liquid in the container depending on the patient age group. [0026]1n yet another aspect of the present invention, the attachment of the circuit to the patient has been disclosed. There has thus been broadly outlined certain embodiments of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof herein may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciatedâ€¢ There are, of course, additional embodiments of the invention that will be described below and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. [0027] In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of" the components set forth in the folfowing description or fflustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of embodiments in addition to those described and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein, as well as the abstract, are for the Purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. [00; 8]ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION [0029]According to a preferred development, the simple and improved indigenous nasal bubble circuit kit with local materials that cost only Rs 250 may turn out to be a viable alternative to a complex CPAP ventilator and that can be used for patients of all age groups, preferably, but not limited to newborns and children up to 32 years old. [O030]According to a further preferred development, the indigenous nasal bubble assembled circuit does not require an air oxygen blender and a humidifier and is noninvasive with less chances of necrosis or erosion of the nostrils and with negligil risk of secondary infection. [0031]According to a further preferred development, the nasal bubble assembled circuit includes components which are readily available at any hospital in sterile pre - packed plastic bags and which can be Safely used for 3 to 4 days without having t change any of the components and beneficial for use in hospitals where number of ventilators are less. [0032] According to a further preferred development, the nasal bubble assembled circuit can be under use while the mother breast-feeds the infant or while the infant is on mother's lap. Use of such simple assembly provides psychological comfort instead of CPAP via ventilators since the intensity of fear becomes less. [00 3]According to a further preferred development, the nasal bubble circuit can be used in children after weaning off from the mechanical ventilator or during transport of patients when well equipped cardiac ambulances are not available or are not affordable. [O034]According to a further preferred development, the nasal bubble assembled circuit is advantageous with respect to a ventilator which is a more sophisticated instrument that requires special training and expertise to handle. Untrair ed doctors are not willing to use it, as more stringent monitoring is needed when patient is on ventilator. Also, to run a ventilator electrical supply needs to be available. With a good infrastructure and trained doctors and supportive staff a ventilator may be an advantage. In resource poor settings with untrained staff, the invention finds a place because of its low cost. ease in assembling and handling, disposable and with fewer chances of infection and complications. [003S]According to a further preferred development, the nasal bubble circuit can work on oxygen cylinder as well. Many a times, newly practicing doctors are inefficient in operating the ventilators during emergency. Another advantage has been that the newly practicing doctors, nurses or even the nontechnical staff can handle the system efficiently in case of temporary emergency requirement.

[O059]Furthermore, as shown in the exemplary illustration in Fig 2 and 5 illustrates the conventional central oxygen source, wherein, this can be the wall mounted oxygen flow meter which receives oxygen through pipes from the main oxygen bank. The knob on the flow meter is used to adjust the desired oxygen flow rate between 6 to 8 liters per minute. The bottle attached to the flow meter can be filled with warm water to provide humidified oxygen to the patient, To the outlet nozzle which is attached to the flow meter, the oxygen nozzle end of the Pediatric nasal cannula is attached. [0060]The other commercially available CPAP system has been tried only in premature babies with respiratory distress who need oxygen support for longer duration and have high chances of complications of oxygen toxicity and not on older children with pneumonia, swine flu like symptoms or respiratory distress especially under pandemic situations, It is known that patients with pneumonia or swine flu like symptoms need oxygen therapy for shorter periods where cost-effective circuit as that of the invention can be used. It is the first time ever that an assembly or a circuit of the described invention in a kit form has been successfully used in treating older children with respiratory distress. 10061]In one embodiment, as illustrated in Fig 3 and 4, modifications and/or plastic surgery on conventional nasal cannula and conventional IV infusion set to form a circuit has been disclosed, wherein; the right side tube (Sa) of the cannula between the adjusting knob (4) and the nasal prongs cut by a sharp blade at 10 centimeter from the nasal prongs. The cut end (5a) that is on the side of the adjusting knob is then tied into a tight knot and taped with a sticking plaster so that no oxygen can eak h from that knotted end. The other cut end (5b) that is 10 centimeter away from the nasal prongs then attached to the rubber tubing (8) that will be available from the IV infusion set. [0062]In the same disclosed embodiment as illustrated in Fig 4, the IV set is modified as follows; the tube coming out of the Murphy's chamber is cut at a distance of 5 centimeter from the chamber using a sharp blade. The stiff plastic adapter at the end of the rubber tubing at the other end is also cut from the rubber tubing with a sharp blade. The plastic adapter and the part with the Murphy's chamber are discarded. The remaining tube with the ru 1 er tubing (8) is then attached to the modified cut end (5b} of pediatric nasal cannula. IV set is preferably used in the given embodiments, but should not be limited herein; any other rubber or plastic connector tubing having two ends may fall within the scope of the disclosed invention. [0063]Furthermore, as i11ustrated in Fig 2 and 5 and 8, saline bottle's (13) nozzle end a small hole pierced using the tip of the sharp blade into which the above modified connector tubing, particularly tube snuggly fitted and inserted into the liquid storage container (13) at a distance ranging from centimeter depending on the patient age group, preferably, but not limited to 5 centimeter from the level of the liquid (11) in the container when vertically placed on the bottle base. [0064]As illustrated in Fig 2 and 5, wherein; the modified circuit disclosed is as follows, the rubber tubing end (8) of the modified connector tubing is attached to the cut end (5b) of the pediatric nasal cannula which is about 10 centimeter from the nasal prongs. The other end (9) of the connector tubing used snuggJy fit into the liquid storage container, preferably, but not limited to normal saline bottle at distance ranging from 5 to 20 centimeter depending on the patient age group, preferably, centimeter (12) below the level of the liquid (3.1) in the container.

The nasal prong (7) is introduced into the patient's nostrils, Using a sticking plaster the plastic tunings on either side of the nasal prongs are taped on the patients cheeks so that they do not slip. Once the circuit is attached to the patient the oxygen is started using the regulator knob on the flow meter to deliver 6 to 8 liters per minute flow rate into the circuit so that a continuous stream of bubbles is formed in the liquid container. This entire assembly will give a CPAP of 5 centimeter to 20 centimeter and a FiO2 of around 70% with oxygen humidified by using warm water in the container attached to the flow meter. [0066]1n one embodiment an experiment which proves the effective use of nasal bubble CPAP in pediatric acute respiratory failure in infants and children during swine-flu pandemic" is illustrated. [0067JAn example for the above embodiment illustrates; assessing the effectiveness of noninvasive ventilation (NIV)-Nasal Bubble CPAP Circuit in children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; in improving gas exchange and vital signs; and assess method safety. [O068}As illustrated in the above embodiment, the study design was prospective, observational, cross sectional study and the study site was Swine flu ICU at Sassoon General Hospital, Pune. Sample size was as follows: Thirty Six children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure admitted to swine flu ICU during the present H1NIpandemic were included, wherein; i8 were confirmed HIN1 positive and 18 were confirmed H1N1 negative children. All were administered Nasal Bubble CPAP on admission after a baseline Arterial Blood Gas to detect the severity of hypoxia. [O069]Further illustrated in the same embodier are the Interventions & Measurements, wherein, all children received oxygen via Nasal Bubble CPAP Circuit indigenously prepared which gave expiratory positive airway pressure of 5 centimeter water. Vital signs ( respiratory rate & heart rate , pH, PaO2, PaCO2, PO2/FiO2 and 02 saturation were recorded at start and at 6 hours into the q study. {0070] Fig 11, 12 and 13 illustrates the result of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, wherein, median age of the patient was 18 months with 58% males and 42% females. All the patients studied had severe respiratory distress and PaO2/ FiO2 ratio suggestive of acute lung injury (median 278, (range 261 -323 ) with severe respiratory distress on admission. [0071]Fig 11 and 12 show the vital signs and arterial blood gas changes before and after initiation of NBCPAP. RR and HR fell significantly in the first six hour of NBCPAP compared with the initial values. PaO /FiO improved significantly within 6 hrs (p < 0.017). Changes in PaQ 2 was statistically significant at the end of 6 hrs ( P < 0.0005 ). The O 2 saturation significantly improved after 6 hrs of NBCPAP (p < 0.001). [O072]Fig 3.3 illustrates the underlying respiratory conditions, wherein; pneumonia showed 67%, bronchopneumonia was 22% and Empyema 12% Respiratory rate and heart rate improved significantly with Nasal Bubble CPAP. Respiratory rate and heart rate were significantly lower after 6 hrs of treatment compared with admission (p < 0.0001 and p< 0.001 ), respectively. [0073]Further illustrated in the above embodiment, at the end of six hours on NB-CPAP circuit, PaO 2 (p <O.0001), PCO 2 (p< 0.0001), POJFiO 2 (p < 0.0002) and 0 2 saturation (p <0.001) improved significantly. The duration of iCU stay and median duration of NB-CPAP use was 2 days ( range 2-5 days ) and none requiring endotracheal intubation. Theand the nasal prongs did not cause any nasal or facial skin erosions at pressure points. The median hospital stay was 7 (range 6 - 11days).
