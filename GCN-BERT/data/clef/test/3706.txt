Step 6: preparation of intermediate (2S,4S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-7-one (4f)
To a solution of (3S,4S,6S)-N-allyloxy-4-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-6-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]piperidin-3-amine (4e) (1.88 g, 4.37 mmol) and TEA (2.43 mL, 17.48 mmol) in anhydrous ACN (360 mL) at 0Â°C was added diphosgene (0.290 mL, 2.40 mmol) as a solution in ACN (6 mL, flow = 0.15 mL/min). Once addition was completed, the reaction was stirred to rt for 1 h. The mixture was washed with water (500 mL), extracted with EtOAc (3 x 200 mL) dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The crude residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc : gradient 100/0 to 0/100) to provide intermediate (2S,4S,5S)-6-allyloxy-4-[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-7-one (4f) (1.22 g, 2.67 mmol, 61 %) as a brown oil.
