1. ïï 36 "CARBAMOYLOXYISOXAZOLE DERIVATIVES, THEIR PREPARATION AND INSECTICIDAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM" The present invention relates to a series of new carbamoyloxyisoxazole derivatives, to processes for preparing them and to insecticidal compositions containing these new derivatives. Insects cause considerable damage to plants and can represent a serious danger to health; at best, they are a major nuisance. Accordingly, large sums are spent on their destruction. Although many insecticides are available, a large number of these have to be used with considerable care, because they endanger the health of humans or other animals or because of their phytotoxicity. Moreover, because of their short lire cycles, insects can develop immunity to many of the commonly used insecticides and, accordingly, there is always a continuing need for new compounds exhibiting insecticidal properties. A number of compounds containing the isoxazole system are known to exhibit insecticidal activity. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 10145/70 discloses carbamoyloxyisoxazole derivatives of formula: o 3.OE60 36 (in which Ra, Rb and Rd each represents a lower alkyl group and Rc represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group) and dìscloses that these compounds are useful as insecticides. However, these compounds are potentially toxic to warm-blooded animals, which means that such severe restrictions would have to be placed upon their use that, in practice, they are unlikely ever to be actually used. We have now discovered a series of carbamoyloxyisoxazole derivatives which, whilst chemically similar to the known compounds of the aforementioned Japanese Patent Application, surprisingly have very much reduced toxicity to warm-blooded animals but, at the same time, equally good or even better insecticidal activity. The invention, accordingly, provides compounds of formula (I): o /CH3 R1 0 -CO--N cH3 (1) in which: R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom; R2 represents a C1 -C6 alkyl group; and A represents an oxygen atom, a sulphur atom, a sulphinyl group or a sulphonyl group. The invention also provides a process for preparing these compounds, in which a compound of formula (III): XCH2 0 IN (III} 1160 36 4. (wherein R1 is as defined above and X represents a halogen atom) is reacted with an alkoxide or mercaptide of formula (Iv): R2 - A' - M (IV) (in which R2 is as defined above, A' represents an oxygen atom or a sulphur atom and M represents an alkali metal atom) to give a compound of formula (Il): (II} (in which RI, R2 and A' are as defined above) and, if necessary, said compound of formula (Il) in which A' represents a sulphur atom is oxidized to give a compound of formula (V): RI R2-S(O)n-CH2 O./lt 5. R1 R2 (wherein and are as defined above and is 1 or z). The invention still further provides an insecticidal composition comprising an insecticide and a carrier or diluent, characterized in that the insecticide comprises one or more of the compounds of formula (I) defined above. In the compounds of formula (I), where RI represents a halogen atom, it may be a chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine atom and is preferably a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, more preferably a chlorine or bromine atom. It is, however, preferred that R1 should represent a hydrogen atom. R2 represents a straight or branched chain C1 -C6 alkyl group, for example a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl or pentyl group, preferably a C1 -C3 alkyl group and most preferably a methyl or ethyl group. A preferably represents a sulphur atom. Representative examples of compounds of the invention are listed below; the numbers appended to the compounds in the following list are used to identify o .IL&60; 36 those compounds hereinafter: 3-Dimethylcarbamoyloxy-5-methylthiomethylisoxa3-Dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-ethylthiomethyli soxaQ zole 3-Dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-propylthiomethyl i soxa3-Dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-i sopropylthiomethyl i soxa5. 3-Dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-methyl sul phinylmethylisoxazole 6. 3-Dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-ethyl sul phinylmethylisoxazole 7. 3-Dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-methyl sul phonylmethylisoxazoie 8. 3-Dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-ethylsul phonylmethylisoxazole 9. 4-Chl oro-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-methylthiomethyl i soxazole o 10. 4-Chl oro-3-dimethylcarbamoyl oxy-5-ethyl thiomethyl i soxazol e 11. 4-Chl oro-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-methyl sul phinyl - methyl i soxazole 12, 4-Chl oro-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-methyl sul phonylmethyl i soxazol e 13, 4-Bromo-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-methyl thiomethyl - isoxazole. 14. 3-Dimethylcarbamoyl oxy-4-iodo-5-methylthiomethyl - isoxazole 15, 3-Dimethylcarbamoyl oxy-5-methoxymethyl isoxazole. 16. 3-Dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-ethoxymethyl i soxazol e 17, 4-Chl õro-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-5-methoxymethylisoxazole 18. 4-Chl oro-3-dimethylcarbamoyl oxy-5-ethoxymethyl - isoxazole, Of the compounds listed above, particularly preferred compounds are Compounds NOo 1, 2, 9 and 13. o OE6G 36 Compounds of formula (II): 0 ./N /CH3 -CO--N-.cH3 (III ,i (in which R1 and R2 are as defined above and A' represents an oxygen atom or a sulphur atom), that is to say compounds of formula (I) in which A is an oxygen or sulphur atom, may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (III): RI XCH2 0 / N O--CO-N CH3 "CH3 (III] (in which R1 and X are as defined above) with an alkoxide or mercaptide of formula (IV): R2 - A' M (IV) (in wh,ich R2, A' and M are as defined above). The alkoxide or mercaptide may have been prepared in advance; alternatively, it may be prepared in situ in a suitable reaction solvent,by methods well-known in the art. 1160 ,36 9. The reaction between the compounds of formulae (III) and (IV) is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include: alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol; ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxan or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; dimethylformamide; dimethyl sulphoxide; hexamethylphosphoric triamide; of these solvents. cularly preferred. and mixtures of any two or more Of these solvents, ethers are partiWhere the compound of formula (IV) is a mercaptide, additional suitable solvents include: water; ketones, such as acetone or methyl isobutyl ketone; and mixtures of any two or more of the solvents. In the case of a mercaptide, methanol is the preferred solvent. The reaction is preferably effected at a temperature greater than O°C but below the reflux temperature of the solvent used; preferably the temperature may range from above O°C to ambient temperature. After completion of the reaction, the desired product of formula (II) may be separated and purified by techniques well-known in the art. For example, the solvent is distilled off under reduced pressure; the residue is diluted with a solvent such as methylene chloride; the organic solution is washed and dried; and then the solvent is distilled off. The product 10. may then be further purified, if desired, by recrystallization or by various chromatography techniques. Compounds of formula (V): t RI CN3 Il -e-c°-N3 R2-S(01n-CH20/H,. (wherein RI and R2 are as defined above and is 1 or 2), that is to say compounds of formula (1) in which A represents a sulphinyl or sulphonyl group, may be prepared by oxidizing the corresponding compound of formula (VI): R2S-CI0/N (in which R1 and R2 are as defined above); the compound of formula (VI) may itself have been prepared as described above. The oxidizing agent is preferably a peroxide, for example hydrogen peroxide or an organic peroxide (such as benzoyl peroxide or m-chloroperbenzoic acid, 11. preferably m-chloroperbenzoic acid). Where hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidizing agent, the reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, for example an aliphatic carbo ylic acid, particularly acetic acid, and the amount of hydrogen peroxide employed is preferably an approximately equimolar amount with respect to the compound of formula (VI). Where hydrogen peroxide is the oxidizing agent, the reaction is preferably effected at a temperature of from 5°C to 25°C. On the other hand, where an organic peroxide, particularly m-chloroperbenzoic acid, is used as the oxidizing agent, the reaction is also preferably effected in the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction; preferred solvents are halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. In this case, the organic peroxide is preferably employed in an amount greater than equimolar. The reaction will go to completion at a relatively low temperature, which may be below ambient temperature and as low as O°C, within a few hours. However, the reaction can also be performed at the reflux temperature of the solvent employed. In the case where an organic peroxide is used, 12. Æ£6D; 36 insolubles, if any, should be filtered off before the desired product is separated from the reaction mixture and purified. After completion of the reaction, the solvent is preferably distilled off under reduced pressure, after which the residue is diluted with a solvent such as methylene chloride, the organic solution is washed and dried and then the solvent is distilled off. The resulting product may, if desired, be further purified by recrystallization or chromatography. Compounds of formula (III) are novel and also form part of the present invention. They may be prepared by reacting a 3-hydroxyisoxazole derivative of formula (VII): OH ( IIl (in which R1 and X are as defined above) with a carbamoyl halide of formula (VIII): 13. ï160 /CH3 Y--CON CH3 (in which Y represents a halogen atom). The reaction is preferably effected çn the presence of a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reaction. Suitable solvents include: aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene or xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dioxan, tetrahydrofuran or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone; and amides, such as dimethylformamide, diethylacetamide and hexamethylphosphoric triamide. The temperature of the reaction may vary over a wide range and the reaction may, for example, be effected with ice-cooling or at temperatures up to ambient. The reagents are preferably employed in an equimolar or approximately equimolar ratio and the reaction is 14. Preferably effected in the presence of an acid-binding agent, which may be organic (e.g. an organic amine, such as dicyclohexylamine, dimethylbenzylamine, picoline or lutidine) or inorganic (e.g. an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate, e.g. the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of sodium or potassium). The compounds of formula (VIl) which are used as starting materials in this process may be prepared, where R1 represents a hydrogen atom, by the method described in Tetrahedron Letters 25, 2077 (1965). Compounds in which R1 represents a halogen atom may be prepared by reacting the corresponding compound in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom with a halogenating agent, for example chlorine, bromine, a sulphuryl halide or an N-halosuccinimide. For example, compounds of formula (VII) in which R1 represents a chlorine atom may be obtained by treating the corresponding compound in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom with sulphuryl chloride, under reflux, in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, or with a calculated amount ofgaseous chlorine, at ambient temperature, in dimethylformamide. Compounds of formula (VII) in which R1 represents a bromine or iodine atom may be obtained by treating the corresponding compound in which RI represents a 15. hydrogen atom with _N-bromosuccinimide or N-iodosuccinimide in dimethylformamide, with heating to about 60°C. We have found that the compounds of formula (1) exhibit insecticidal activity against a ide variety of insect pests, including many of importance to agriculture, for example the green peach aphid, the green rice leafhopper and the brown planthopper; such activity is comparable with or even higher than that of known compounds but is accompanied by remarkably low toxicity to warmblooded animals. In order to control effectively harmful insects, the compounds of formula (1) may be formulated with carriers and diluents well-known in this art, particularly with agriculturally acceptable carriers and diluents, by conventional techniques. The resulting compositions may be in various forms, both solid and liquid and may be used for spraying or soil application to control insects on leaves and stems of various plants, including rice plants, fruit trees, vegetables and flowers. The compounds of the invention have the significant advantage of possessing systemic insecticidal activity. The compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with various organic phosphate or carbamate insecticides in order to broaden the insecticidal 16. 1150 36 spectrum and the compounds most suprisingly show synergistic activity in such combinations. Examples of insecticides which may be used in combination with the compounds of formula (I) include, for example: O,O-Diethyl O-(5-phenyl-3-isoxazolyl)phosphorothioate (Isoxathion); methyl N-(methylcarbamoyloxy)thioacetimidate (Methomyl); O,O-Dimethyl O-(3-methyl-4-nitrophenyl)thiophosphate (Fenitrothion); O,O-Dimethyl O-[2-chloro-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)- vinyl]phosphate (Dimethyl vi nphos) ; O,0-Dimethyl S-(«-ethoxycarbonylbenzyl)phosphorodithioate (Cidial); O_,O-Dipropyl O-4-methylthiophenylphosphate (Propaphos); 1-Naphthyl N-methylcarbamate (Carbaryl); and 2-1sopropylphenyl N-methylcarbamate (Isoprocarb); 3-Tolyl 17. 1160í 36 _N-methylcarbamate (MTMC). The synergistic effect obtained by combining one or more of the compounds of formula (I) with one or more organic phosphate or carbamate insecticides, P such as those mentioned above, will be observed over a very wide range of ratios between the active ingredients. In general, however, we prefer to employ from 0.1 to parts by weight of the organic phosphate or carbamate insecticide per one part by weight of the compound of formula (I). The compounds of the invention may be employed in various types of preparation as is well-known for other insecticides; for example, they may be in the form of dusts, coarse dusts, micro granules, fine granules, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, aqueous solutions or suspensions, water-soluble powders or oil suspensions. The carrier employed may be natural or synthetic and organic or inorganic; it is mixed with the active ingredient to assist that ingredient to reach the material to be treated, and to make it easier to store, transport or handle the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include: inorganic substances, such as clays (examples of which are kaolinite, montmorillonite and attapulgite), talc, mica, pyrophyllite, 18. pumice, vermiculite, gypsum, calcium carbonate, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, magnesium carbonate, apatite, zeolite, silicic anhydride and synthetic calcium silicate; organic substances derived from vegetables, such as soybean meal, tobacco powder, walnut powder, wheat flour, wood meal, starch and crystalline cellulose; synthetic or natural high molecular weight polymers, such as cumarone resins, petroleum resins, alkyd resins, polyvinyl chloride, polyalkylene glycols, ketone resins, ester gums, copal gum and dammar gum; waxes, such as carnauba wax and beeswax; or urea. Examples of suitable liquid carriers include: paraffinic or naphthenic hydrocarbons, such as kerosine, mineral oil, spindle oil and white oil; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, cumene and methylnaphthalene; chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, trichloroethylene, chlorobenzene and _o-chlorotoluene; ethers, such as dioxan and tetrahydrofuran; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, acetophenone and isophorone; esters, such as ethyl acetate, pentyl acetate, ethylene glycol acetate, diethylene glycol acetate, dibutyl maleate and diethyl succinate; alcohols, such as methanol, hexanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, cyclohexanol and benzyl Œ69236 19. alcohol; ether alcohols, such as ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monophenyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and diethylene glycol monobutyl ether; other polar organic solvents, such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide; and water. The insecticidal compositions of the present invention may contain surface active agents in order to emulsify, disperse, wet, spread, bind, control disintegration of, improve fluidity of or rust-proof the insecticidal composition or to stabilize the active ingredient; although any of the conventional classes of surface active agent, be they non-ionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric, may be employed, we prefer to employ nonionic and/or anionic surface active agents. Examples of suitable non-ionic surface active agents include: the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with higher alcohols, such as lauryl alcohol, stearyl alcohol or oleyl alcohol; the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with alkylphenols, such as isooctylphenol or nonyl- phenol; the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with alkylnaphthols, such as butylnaphthol or octylnaphthol; the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with higher fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, stearic acid or oleic acid; the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with monoor dialkylphosphoric acids, such as stearylphosphoric acid ££60 36 or dilaurylphosphoric acid; the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with amines, such as dodecylamine; the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with h!gher fatty acid amides, such as stearamide; the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with higher fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols, such as sorbitan, and the fatty acid esters themselves; and the polymerization adducts of ethylene oxide with propylene oxide. Examples of suitable anionic surface active agents include: alkyl sulphate salts, such as sodium lauryl sulphate or oleyl sulphate amine salt; alkyl sulphonate salts, such as sodium dioctyl sulphosuccinate or sodium 2-ethylhexene sulphonate; and aryl sulphonate salts, such as sodium isopropylnaphthalene sulphonate, sodium methylenebisnaphthalene sulphonate, sodium ligninsulphonate or sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate. Moreover, the insecticidal compositions of the present invention may be used in combination with high molecular weight compounds or other auxiliary agents, such as casein, gelatin, albumin, glue, sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose or polyvinyl alcohol, in order to improve the properties and/or to increase the biological effect of the composition. Æt60Z36 21. The above-mentioned carriers and various auxiliary agents may be used alone or in any desired combination, depending upon the type of preparation, the application and other factors. i The concentration of the active ingredient, the compound or compounds of formula (1), in the composition may vary over a wide range, although it will normally be from 0.1 to 95% by weight and more preferably from I to 90% by weight of the composition, depending upon the type of preparation. For example, dusts may conveniently contain from I to 25% by weight of the active compound, the remainder being a solid carrier. Wettable powders may conveniently contain, for example, from 25 to 90% by weight of the active compound, the remainder being a solid carrier and a dispersing and wetting agent, if required, together with a protective colloidal agent, a thixotropic agent and an anti-foaming agent. Granules may conveniently contain from 1 to 35% by weight of the active compound, a major portion of the remainder being a solid carrier. The active compound is preferably homogeneously admixed with the solid carrier or is adhered to or adsorbed onto the 22. carrier surface; the diameter of each granule is preferably from 0.2 to 1.5 mm. Emulsifiable concentrates may conveniently contain, for example, from 5 to 50% by weight of the àctive compound and from 5 to 20% by weight of an emulsifying agent, the remainder being a liquid carrier, together with, if required, a corrosion inhibitor.

EXAMPLE 1 4-Chl oro-5-chl oromethyl-3-hydroxyi soxazol e To a solution of 8.01 g of 5-chloromethyl-3hydroxyisoxazole in 50 ml Of benzene were added 10 g of sulphuryl chloride, and then the mixture was refluxed for 10 hours. At the end of this time, the solvent and the excess sulphuryl chloride were distilled off from the reaction mixture, and the residue was dissolved ìn 50 ml of diethyl ether and washed five rimes, each time with 20 ml of water. The washed diethyl ether solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, the solvent was removed by distillation, and the residue was extracted three times, each time with 30 ml of hot hexane. The hexane was distilled off from the extract and the residue was recrystallized from carbon tetrachloride, to give 4-chloro-5-chloromethyl-3-hydroxyisoxazole in the form of colourless crystals melting at 116 - 118°C. EXAMPLE 2 4-Bromo-5-chloromethyl 3-hydroxyisoxazole To a solution of 1.33 g of 5-chloromethyl-3-hydroxyisoxazole in 2 ml of dimethylformamide were added 2.0 g of N-bromosuccinimide, and then the mixture was heated at 61°C for 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture was then poured into I00 ml of ice-water and extracted with diethyl 24. ether, after which the ethereal extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was distilled off, leaving crystals, which were recrystallized from a mixture of diisopropyl ether and hexane, giving 4-bromo5-chloromethyl-3-hydroxyisoxazole, in the form of white crystals melting at 136.5 - 138°C (with decoínposition).

The reaction mixture was then washed twice, each time with 20 ml of water, after which the benzene solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was then distilled off and the remaining oil was purified by column chromatography through silica gel eluted with a 10 : 1 by volume mixture of hexane and acetone, to give 5-chloromethyl-3-dimethyicarbamoyloxyisoxazole in the form of a faintly yellow n24"5 = 1.4977. oi u Following the same procedure as described above, ÆOE60 36 25. the following compounds were also prepared: 5-Chl oromethyl -4-chl oro-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxyisoxazole, n 3 = 1.5024; 4-Bromo-5-chl oromethyl-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxyisoxazole, nD : 1.5166; 5-Chl oromethyl-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxy-4-iodoisoxazole, melting at 69 - 71°C; 5-Bromomethyl-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxyisoxazol e, 23.5 nD = 1° 5062 ; 5-Bromomethyl-4-chl oro-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxyisoxazole, nD22 : 1.5179; and 4-Bromo-5-bromomethyl-3-dimethyl carbamoyl oxyisoxazole, melting at 153 - 154°C.

The ethanol was then distilled from the reaction mixture and 20 ml of water were added to the residue. The mixture was extracted with 40 ml of methylene chloride, and the extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent was distilled off, leaving a brown oil, which was caused to crystallize by the addition of diisopropyl ether. The crystals were then recrystallized from diisopropyl ether, giving 2.62 g (yield 80.9%) of 3-dimethylcarbamoyloxy-5-methylthiomethylisoxazole, in the form of colourless crystals melting at 40-41°C.

The 28. mixture was then stirred for a further 30 minutes, after which it was filtered and the precipitate was washed with 2 ml of methylene chloride. The filtrate and the washings were combined, and then the solvent was removed by distillation, leaving a colourless, crystalline residue, which was recrystallized from diethyl ether, to give 700 mg (yield 86.1%) of 3-dimethylcarbamoyloxy-5methylsulphinylmethylisoxazole, in the form of colourless needles melting at 84-85°C.

Toxicity Test 31. ii6O 3ç EXAMPLE 23 Each of the compounds listed in Table I was administered in the form of a suspension, to.which 0.5% w/v gum tragacanth had been added, to a group of 5 week old ddY-SLC series mice. Each test group consisted of 10 male and 10 female mice. The LD50 value was calculated, by the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon [J. Pharmac. Exp. Ther. 96, 99 (1949)], from the mortality rate after 7 days. The results are shown in Table I. Table 1 Compound No. LD50 (mg/kg) 3-Dimethylcarbamoyloxy-5methylisoxazole (Control) male 110.2 female 109.1 male 124.7 female 103.5 male/female 31«2 32. Similar tests were conducted with each of Compounds No. 3 - 15 and in each case, the LD50 value was greater than 100 mg/kg. These results demonstrate the low toxicity of the compounds of the invention to warm-blooded animals.

The wettable powder thus prepared was then diluted with water to the concentration indicated in Table I, and then 0.01% w/v of Gramin (a spreader) was added. The resulting diluted solution was then sprayed onto the leaves of a cabbage bearing green peach aphids (Myzus persicae) in an amount of 10 ml per leaf. The leaf stalk of each leaf was then placed in a 30 ml bottle containing water and the mouth of the bottle was plugged with cotton wool. The bottles were then left in a 33. &&6O 36 room maintained at 25°C. After 72 hours, the percentage mortality of the aphids was assessed and the results are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Systemic activity Test suspensions were prepared as described above and then diluted to the concentrations indicated in Tables 2 and 3. The suspensions were then poured into 30 ml bottles.
