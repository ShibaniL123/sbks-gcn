RELATED APPLICATIONS This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Pat. Appl. Ser. No. 61/409,331, filed on Nov. 2, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The current invention relates to the field of nail adornments, more specifically to a novel method of applying UV gel to fingernails. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The application of UV gel to fingernails is an increasingly popular method of decorating fingernails in place of ordinary nail enamel. In this process, a salon technician spreads a layer of UV gel on a fingernail and then sets the finger under a UV light which cures the gel. Normally, several gel layers are required. For example, a base coat of UV gel is followed by a pigment-containing UV gel coat and then one or more sealing UV gel coats are applied thereafter. Each of individual layers must be individually brushed on a by a technician and then fully cured under a UV light before an additional coat can be applied. This makes the process extremely time-consuming and burdensome. The skilled technician time that is required in addition to the cost of the materials makes the process very expensive. In fact, a typical UV gel application could take well over an hour and sometime more to apply. If a nail extension is required, the process requires even more labor and skill—thereby increasing the time and cost thereof. In addition to the time and expense associated with UV applications, there are potential health risks as well. The application requires repeated exposure to UV waves and the gel when cured in contact with a fingernail may damage and weaken the nail. Furthermore, once the UV gel is cured on a fingernail—it is very difficult to remove. Typically, the layers must be filed off or left to grow out with the natural nail as conventional nail polish removers do not work. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The current invention is directed to a novel system and method for applying UV gel to fingernails, which significantly reduces the application time and drastically reduces a wearer's UV exposure. Moreover, the UV gel does not directly contact the wearer's fingernail. In the inventive method, a dry nail enamel appliqué is first applied to a wearer's fingernail—which serves as a base coat. Thereafter, a layer of UV gel is applied on top of the appliqué and is cured under a UV light. The appliqué comprises nail enamel in a semi-cured form and an adhesive backing for affixing the same to a nail. The nail appliqué provides a smooth layer of colored nail enamel and the layer of cured UV gel applied atop thereof, provides the cross-linking and the smooth “glassy” finish associated with UV gel application. Not only do embodiments of the invention achieve a beautiful UV gel manicure—with significantly less time and UV exposure—but because a nail appliqué is in direct contact with the wearer's nail, the UV gel does not directly contact the wearer's fingernail. Instead, the UV gel cures on top of the nail appliqué. This is not only much healthier for the nail, but it also allows for more efficient removal of the gel using conventional nail polish remover. In addition, nail extensions are efficiently achieved in accordance with the invention. In an embodiment of the invention, a sufficiently rigid dry nail appliqué is applied to a fingernail in a manner such that a portion of the appliqué extends past the edge of the fingertip. With the appliqué so positioned, UV gel is then applied atop thereof and cured. After the UV gel is cured, there is a hardened nail enamel/UV gel surface extending past the wearer's fingertip (the extension portion). The extension portion could be trimmed and shaped using a nail clipper or another shearing device. U.S. Patent Appl. Pub. No. 2009/0233031 discloses a nail appliqué that has an enamel layer and a pre-cured UV layer applied atop of the enamel layer. However, the current invention allows for a more durable application, is customizable to a user and allows for nail extensions as described below.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following is a detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the drawings in which the same reference numerals identify the same elements of structure in each of the several figures. It should be noted that these drawings are merely exemplary in nature and in no way serve to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the claims appearing herein below. As mentioned, the current state of applying UV gel requires, at a minimum, three gel layers. Each layer requires careful application of the gel and curing time under a UV light. In the present invention only one layer of UV gel is required to achieve a similar effect. As shown schematically in FIG. 1, a bottom layer comprising a dry nail appliqué12 is first affixed to a fingernail 10. The nail appliqué provides nail polish of a desired color, but it additionally prepares the nail for receiving UV gel by providing a smooth finish on the nail. The nail appliqué is in direct contact with the nail—serving as a buffer between the nail top and the overlaying UV gel. Once the appliqué is firmly applied to the fingernail, a layer of UV gel 14 is brushed to the top surface thereof and cured under a UV light for about 2 minutes—or for as long as necessary to achieve satisfactory curing. Once so cured, the UV and nail enamel fuse together to form a beautiful UV gel nail manicure. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that any cross-linkable polymer may be applied atop of a nail appliqué. In addition, curing of such cross-linkable polymers may be achieved by way of a UV lamp or any similar suitable source of thermal energy. The nail appliqué used as the bottom layer is preferably a nail appliqué made from real nail enamel cut into a substantially fingernail shaped section. The nail appliquéhas an adhesive bottom surface, which adheres the bottom surface of the nail appliqué to the top surface of a fingernail. After applying the nail appliqué to the fingernail—any excess portion of the appliqué is sheared off using a fingernail or a shearing device. An important aspect of the nail appliqué is that when it is manufactured it is not allowed to fully dry before being sealed within a plastic package. Therefore, after it is applied to a user's fingernail, the final curing step takes place on the fingernail. As such, the nail appliqué behaves much like traditional, brush-on nail polish—only it is applied in dry form. In embodiments of the invention, the nail appliqué is preferably one similar to the appliqué described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/126,862 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,903,840 and incorporated by reference herein and may include a plurality of partially cured nail enamel layers atop an adhesive layer. Conventional nail polish has the advantage of being applied rather quickly, does not require UV exposure and does not pose a health risk to a fingernail. On the other hand, a UV gel manicure has a more appealing look than a traditional manicure and it is much more durable. The instant invention, essentially, achieves the best of both worlds in that a beautiful, durable UV gel manicure is achieved in reduced application time and with minimal UV exposure. Moreover, the UV gel does not directly contact an underlying fingernail. Furthermore, embodiments of the invention allow for similar rapid and efficient applications of fingernail extensions. In the current state of the art, applying a fingernail extension using UV technology is an extremely arduous process requiring significant time, materials and expertise. To achieve a nail extension, a slender strip of material is inserted in the underside of a nail to act as a substrate to receive UV gel. Once the UV gel is applied and cured, the layer often requires grinding or other adjustments to ensure a smooth transition between the natural nail and the extended portion. An extension, as such, requires several coats, high UV exposure requires a significant amount of time and skill and it is very expensive. As an alternative to UV gel extensions, users often glue plastic nails to their fingers. The rigid plastic does not easily conform to the natural shape of a fingernail. In addition, it must be glued to the fingernail—which is unhealthy and difficult to remove. In an embodiment of the invention, a nail extension is achieved rapidly, efficiently and with minimal UV exposure. FIG. 2 shows the process of applying an extension according to an embodiment of the invention. Beginning with an unadorned fingernail (step A), a wearer or technician applies a nail enamel appliqué 12 to the fingernail—leaving a portion of the appliqué overhanging the edge of the nail tip (step B). The length of the appliqué overhang may range from several centimeters to ¾ of an inch—or even more. The appliqué is pressed on to the nail until it is securely affixed thereto. The nail appliqué 12 is of sufficient rigidity such that it remains extended past the nail tip—substantially in the same plane as the fingernail (as shown in step B). Thereafter, UV gel 14 is applied to the entire top surface of the nail appliqué (step C). The nail, which now has an appliqué 12 covering and extending from it and a layer of UV gel 14 supported thereon (as shown, schematically in FIG. 4), is then inserted beneath a UV light and cured. After sufficiently curing to achieve a “glassy” finish, the extended portion of the nail appliqué (and UV layer) is preferably cut to a desired length and shape by way of a nail clipper or such similar shearing device (step D). The UV gel is transparent or translucent when cured, such that the underlying nail appliqué is visible through the cured UV gel layer (as shown in Step D). This gives a technician or wearer the freedom to select any of various appliqué styles or designs to be used in combination with a top UV gel layer. FIG. 3 shows a schematic view of the nail tip extension described above. As shown, a dry enamel nail appliqué 12 is applied to the fingernail such that it extends past the tip thereof. A layer of UV gel 14 rests on the appliqué. When the UV gel 14 is cured it becomes affixed to the appliqué 12 upon which it is applied. In another embodiment of the invention, a French-style nail extension is achieved. As shown in FIG. 4, beginning with an unadorned fingernail (step E), a nail enamel appliqué 12 of a first color (e.g. pink) is applied to the entire fingernail and securely affixed thereto (step F). Next, a second tip appliqué 16 of a second color (e.g. white) is applied to the nail tip (step G). The tip appliqué 16 comprises a rounded or curved edge 18, which roughly follows the contours of a nail tip when applied thereto. Tip appliqué16 is of sufficient rigidity such that when it is applied to a fingertip and so anchored thereto—its remaining length will remain overhanging the nail tip in substantially the same plane as the nail's top surface (as shown in step G). Thereafter, UV gel is brushed onto the top surface of the nail appliqué 12 and nail tip appliqué 16 covering, both, the nail appliqué 12 and the overhanging tip appliqué 16 (step H). The nail is then inserted beneath a UV light and cured. After sufficiently curing to achieve a “glassy” finish, the extended portion of the nail appliqué (and UV layer) is preferably cut to a desired length and shape by way of a nail clipper or such similar shearing device (step 1). As described above, the transparent or translucent cured UV layer allows the underlying appliqués to be viewed. in that manner, a nail having a first color (e.g. pink) and an extending tip having a second color (e.g. white) is achievable to yield a French manicure. FIG. 5 shows a schematic view of the French tip extension described above. A bottom appliqué 12 is shown which substantially covers an entire fingernail. A second nail tip appliqué 16 is applied to the nail tip and extends therefrom. Finally, a UV gel layer 14 is applied atop the nail appliqué 12 and the nail tip appliqué 16. Note that portions 12a and 16a of nail appliqué 12 and nail tip appliqué 16 are handling tabs, which are separated from the main body of the appliqués—preferably by way of a partial cut or perforation. FIG. 6 shows a schematic view of another embodiment of the invention, whereby a nail tip appliqué 16 is applied directly to a fingernail 10 and which extends therefrom. A UV layer 14 is applied atop the natural nail and the nail appliqué. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that any of various top coats may be applied atop the UV layer described above. A top coat may comprise a clear and or translucent UV or enamel coat or such combination thereof Having described this invention with regard to specific embodiments, it is to be understood that the description is not meant as a limitation since further modifications and variations may be apparent or may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. It is intended that the present application cover all such modifications and variation as fall within the scope of the appended claims. 1.
