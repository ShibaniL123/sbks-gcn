FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition useful as an anticoagulant, which comprises a component that is improved in dissolution property. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION N1-(5-chloropyridin-2-yl)-N2-(4-[(dimethylamino)carbonyl]-2-{[(5-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothiazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-2-yl)carbonyl]amino}cyclohexyl)ethanediamide, represented by formula (1), its pharmacologically acceptable salt, and their hydrates (hereinafter referred to as “compound (1)”) are known to have a potent inhibitory action on activated blood coagulation factor X. Compound (1) also is known to be useful as a pharmaceutical, particularly such as an activated blood coagulation factor X inhibitor; a blood coagulation suppressor; an agent for preventing and/or treating thrombosis or embolism; an agent for preventing and/or treating thrombotic diseases; or an agent for preventing and/or treating cerebral infarction, cerebral embolism, heart infarction, angina pectoris, pulmonary embolism, Buerger's disease, deep vein thrombosis, universal intravascular coagulation syndrome, thrombus formation after artificial valve/joint replacement, thrombus formation and reocclusion after revascularization, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or thrombus formation during extracorporeal circulation or blood coagulation upon blood sample collection (Patent Documents 1 to 4). Patent Document 1: WO 03/000657 Patent Document 2: WO 03/000680 Patent Document 3: WO 03/016302 Patent Document 4: WO 2004/058715 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention In a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration (e.g., tablet), the dissolution property of a pharmaceutically active ingredient thereof has an influential role in the efficacy and safety of the composition. Therefore, each country has established a standard rule pertaining to dissolution test method and its specification. Take Japan, the United States and Europe, for example. These countries are each publishing their Pharmacopoeias in which a method for carrying out a dissolution test is explained for guidance. Under such pharmacopeia, there are a variety of medium that are allowed to use for dissolution test (hereinafter referred to as “dissolution test medium”). These dissolution test medium have a pH that is adjusted to 1 to 8. Examples of the dissolution test medium described in the Pharmacopoeias of many countries include strongly acidic dissolution test medium (e.g., the first fluid for dissolution testing described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (hereinafter referred to as “JP 1st fluid”) and 0.1N hydrochloric acid), dissolution test medium having a pH of 3 to 5 (e.g., acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer solution and McIlvaine buffer solution), dissolution test medium having a pH of 6.8 (e.g., the second fluid for dissolution testing described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (hereinafter referred to as “JP 2nd fluid”) and phosphate buffer solution having a pH of 6.8), and water. A pharmaceutical drug product for oral administration is required to exhibit sufficient dissolution property when its dissolution test is carried out using such a medium. Meanwhile, compound (1) is a basic compound and exhibits high solubility in a strong acidic aqueous solution, but its solubility decreases in a neutral pH aqueous solution (e.g., neutral buffer solution). Compound (1) itself exhibits excellent absorbability, if orally administered to a subject. On the other hand, an orally-administered pharmaceutical composition containing compound (1) that can be produced by use of a commonly used pharmaceutical excipient (e.g., lactose or cornstarch) turned out to have no good dissolution property. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing compound (1) as an active ingredient and exhibiting excellent dissolution property. Means for Solving the Problems In view of the foregoing, the present inventors have produced compositions containing compound (1) with a variety of pharmaceutical excipients, and have investigated the dissolution characteristics of the produced compositions.

Particularly when the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is in the table form, the compound (1) content (as free form) is generally 1 to 100 mg/tablet, preferably 5 to 75 mg/tablet, more preferably 15 to 60 mg/tablet. The compound (1) dissolution property of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be evaluated by, for example, dissolution tests disclosed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), and the European Pharmacopoeia. Examples of the test medium employed in the dissolution tests will next be described. Non-limitative examples of the aforementioned strongly acidic dissolution test medium include the JP 1st fluid described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, and “USP 0.1N HCl, Simulated Gastric Fluid without Enzyme” described in the United States Pharmacopoeia. Non-limitative examples of the dissolution test medium (pH: 6.8) include the JP 2nd fluid and phosphate buffer (pH: 6.8) described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia; “USP Phosphate Buffer (pH: 6.8), Simulated Intestinal Fluid without Enzyme” described in the United States Pharmacopoeia; and Phosphate Buffer Solution (pH: 6.8) described in the European Pharmacopoeia. The dissolution test medium (pH: 3 to 5) may be a test medium having a pH of 4.0 or 4.5. Specific examples include acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia; “USP Acetate Buffer” described in the United States Pharmacopoeia; and Acetate Buffer Solution (pH: 4.5) described in the European Pharmacopoeia. Alternatively, a diluted McIlvaine buffer (pH: 4.0) may also be employed. However, the dissolution test medium (pH: 3 to 5) is not limited to the above examples. These dissolution test medium are prepared through methods described in the corresponding Pharmacopoeia. When the employed dissolution test medium is a buffer solution, variation of the pH of the test medium specified in the corresponding Pharmacopoeia is preferably controlled to fall within a range of ±0.05.

As used herein, the “average percent dissolution” refers to an average of percent dissolution values obtained from at least 3, preferably 6, more preferably 12 solid preparation samples of a single type. EXAMPLES The present invention will next be described in detail by way of examples, which should not be construed as limiting the invention thereto. Example 1 Effect of Diluent Tablets containing compound 1a were produced according to the formulations shown in Table 1 (all values in the table are on “mg” basis). The tablets were analyzed in terms of dissolution of compound 1a in accordance with the method 2 (paddle method) at a rotation rate of 50 rpm described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. Percent dissolution was calculated by averaging percent dissolution values of three tablets of the same formulation. An acetate buffer (pH: 4.0) was employed as a dissolution test medium. The acetate buffer (pH: 4.0) was prepared through the following procedure. Method for preparing the acetate buffer (pH: 4.0): Sodium acetate trihydrate (2.45 g) and glacial acetic acid (4.9 g) were weighed, and purified water was added thereto, so that the total volume of the buffer came to 1,000 mL. (Preparation of Tablets) In each case, ingredients shown in Table 1 excepting hydroxypropyl cellulose and magnesium stearate were mixed by means of a mortar, and the mixture was granulated by use of aqueous hydroxypropyl cellulose solution. The thus-produced granules were mixed with magnesium stearate, to thereby yield granules were compressed into tablets using 8.0 mmφ round shaped dies and punches at 7.8 kN of compression force, to thereby yield tablets of interest. In Example 1, the following materials were employed as the ingredients listed in Table 1. Lactose [Pharmatose 200M (trade name)], mannitol [Mannit (trade name)], cornstarch [Cornstarch (trade name)], crystalline cellulose [Ceolus (trade name)], pregelatinized starch [PCS (trade name)], sodium starch glycolate [Primojel (trade name)], hydroxypropyl cellulose [HPC-L (trade name)], and magnesium stearate [HyQual (trade name)].

As is clear from FIG. 1, tablets containing mannitol as a diluent (formulation B), those containing pregelatinized starch as a diluent (formulations C and D), and those containing crystalline cellulose as a diluent (formulation E) exhibited excellent compound 1a dissolution characteristics. Tablets containing mannitol and pregelatinized starch as a diluent (formulation D) and those containing mannitol and crystalline cellulose as a diluent (formulation E) exhibited more excellent compound 1a dissolution characteristics. In contrast, when lactose and cornstarch, which are generally employed as diluent, were employed (formulation A), the compound 1a dissolution property was unsatisfactory. Example 2 Studies on Disintegrant Ingredients shown in Table 2 (all values in the table are on “mg” basis) excepting hydroxypropyl cellulose and magnesium stearate were mixed by means of a mortar, and the mixture was granulated by use of aqueous hydroxypropyl cellulose solution. The thus-produced granules were mixed with magnesium stearate, to thereby yield granules were compressed into tablets using 8.0 mm# round shaped dies and punches at 7.8 kN of compression force, to thereby yield tablets of interest. In a manner similar to that of Example 1, the produced tables were analyzed in terms of dissolution property. The percent dissolution was calculated by averaging percent dissolution values of three tablet samples. In Example 2, the following disintegrants were employed and compared with one another. Sodium starch glycolate [Primojel (trade name)], crospovidone [Polyplasdone (trade name)], carmellose calcium [ECG-505 (trade name)], and low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose [L-HPC (trade name)].

As is clear from FIG. 2, tablets containing sodium starch glycolate or crospovidone as a disintegrant exhibited an excellent compound 1a dissolution property. Example 3 Tablets containing compound 1a were produced according to the formulations shown in Table 3 (all values in the table are on “mg” basis), and were analyzed in terms of dissolution of compound 1a in a manner similar to that of Example 1, except that 0.1N hydrochloric acid (USP 0.1N HCl), water, and phosphate buffer solution (pH: 6.8) [USP Phosphate buffer solution (pH: 6.8)] were employed as dissolution test medium. In each tablet production, ingredients shown in Table 3 excepting hydroxypropyl cellulose and magnesium stearate were mixed together, and the mixture was granulated by means of a fluidized bed granulator through spraying aqueous hydroxypropyl cellulose solution onto the mixture. The thus-produced granules were mixed with magnesium stearate, to thereby yield granules were compressed into tablets using 8.5 mmφ round shaped dies and punches at 7.5 kN of compression force, to thereby yield tablets of interest. The percent dissolution was calculated by averaging percent dissolution values of six tablet samples.

As is clear from FIGS. 3 to 5, tablets containing mannitol and pregelatinized starch exhibited an excellent compound 1a dissolution property in 0.1N hydrochloric acid and in water. Example 4 Studies on Coating Agent Ingredients shown in Table 4 (all values in the table are on “mg” basis) excepting hydroxypropyl cellulose and magnesium stearate were mixed together, and the mixture was granulated by means of a fluidized bed granulator through spraying aqueous hydroxypropyl cellulose solution onto the mixture. The thus-produced granules were mixed with magnesium stearate, to thereby yield granules were compressed into tablets using 8.5 mmφ round shaped dies and punches at about 10 kN of compression force, to thereby yield tablets of interest. The tables were coated with a commercial coating agent by means of a pan coater (Hicoater Multi, product of Freund Corporation), to thereby prepare film-coated tablets. As the coating agent, a pre-mixed product [OPADRY 03F42132 (trade name)], predominantly containing hypromellose, was used. In a manner similar to that of Example 1, tablets coated with OPADRY 03F42132 (3 mg), those coated with OPADRY 03F42132 (10 mg), and those not coated (non-coated tablets) were subjected to dissolution tests in phosphate buffer solution (pH: 6.8) [USP Phosphate buffer solution (pH: 6.8)]. The results are shown in FIG. 6. The percent dissolution was calculated by averaging percent dissolution values of six tablet samples. Separately, by means of a pan coater (Hicoater Mini, product of Freund Corporation), film-coated tablets were produced through coating non-coated tablets with a coating agent [OPADRY 03F42132 (trade name)] predominantly containing hypromellose, generally employed as a rapidly soluble coating agent; a coating agent [OPADRY AMB (trade name)], predominantly containing polyvinyl alcohol, generally employed as a rapidly soluble coating agent; a coating agent [Aquacoat-ECD (trade name)], predominantly containing ethyl cellulose, serving as a pH-independent sustained-release-type coating agent; or a coating agent [Eudragit L30-D55 (trade name)], predominantly containing methacrylate copolymer LD, serving as a pH-dependent enteric coating agent, the amount coating agent in each case being 10 mg. In a manner similar to that of Example 1, these film-coated tablets were subjected to dissolution tests in phosphate buffer solution (pH: 6.8) [USP Phosphate buffer solution (pH: 6.8)]. The results are shown in FIG. 7. The percent dissolution was calculated by averaging percent dissolution values of six tablet samples. Further, by means of a pan coater (Hicoater Multi, product of Freund Corporation), film-coated tablets were produced through coating non-coated tablets with a coating suspension (10 mg) containing about 60% of hypromellose [TC-5 (trade name)]. In a manner similar to that of Example 1, these film-coated tablets were subjected to dissolution tests in acetate buffer solutions (pH: 4.0) and (pH: 4.5). The results are shown in FIG. 8. The percent dissolution was calculated by averaging percent dissolution values of six tablet samples.

Furthermore, the amount of coating agent did not affect the dissolution behavior. As is clear from FIG. 7, tablets coated with a coating agent other than an enteric coating agent exhibited a considerably excellent dissolution property. As is clear from FIG. 8, tablets coated with a hypromellose-based agent exhibited an equivalently excellent dissolution property in acetate buffer solution (pH: 4.0) and in acetate buffer solution (pH: 4.5). 1.
