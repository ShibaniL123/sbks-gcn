To a 100-mL round bottom flask, ((1S,3aR,5aS,6R,11bR,11cS)-14-(cyclopropylmethyl)-10-hydroxy-1,2,3a,4,5,6,7,11c-octahydro-3H-6,11b-(epiminoethano)-1,5a-methanonaphth[1,2-e]indol-3-yl)(2-methoxypyridin-4-yl)methanone obtained above (48 mg, 98 µmol), and pyridine hydrochloride (2.88 g, 25 mmol) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 200°C for 10 minutes with heating. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, and then suspended in 6% aqueous ammonia, and the suspension was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, then the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to column chromatography (aminosilica gel, 8 g) using methanol and chloroform (concentration gradient, 0 to 30%) as the elution solvent to obtain the title compound (35 mg, 75%) as white solid.
