DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <Basic Configuration> An electronic game device 100 in an embodiment of the present invention includes, as illustrated in FIG. 1, a processing unit 10, a storage unit 12, an input unit 14, and an output unit 16. The electronic game device 100 includes a basic configuration of a mobile terminal that can perform communication, such as a mobile phone, a smart phone, or a tablet terminal. The processing unit 10 includes a means to perform calculation processing, such as a CPU. The processing unit 10 functions as an information processing device that realizes processing of an electronic game and the like in the electronic game device 100 by executing an electronic game program stored in the storage unit 12. In the present embodiment, a puzzle-type electronic game is provided by execution of the electronic game program. The storage unit 12 includes a storage means, such as a semiconductor memory or a memory card. The storage unit 12 is connected with the processing unit 10 in an accessible manner, and stores information, such as an electronic game program and data necessary in the processing. The input unit 14 includes a means to input information to the electronic game device 100. The input unit 14 includes a touch panel, a button, and the like that receive an input from the user. The output unit 16 includes a means to output processing results in a user interface screen (UI) for receiving input information from the user or in the electronic game device 100. The output unit 16 includes, for example, a display that presents an image to the user. Further, the electronic game device 100 may include a communication unit 18. The communication unit 18 is configured from an interface for exchanging information with another information communication device through an information communication network. When the electronic game device 100 includes the communication unit 18, the electronic game device 100 may be configured to acquire information related to the electronic game from an external computer (server), and to perform a part of processing (means) described below in the external computer. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the puzzle-type electronic game arranges a plurality of types of objects P1 to P5 in a game screen 200 in a panel manner, receives change of positions of the objects P1 to P5 from the player, and provides an effect on the game when relationship of the positions of the plurality of objects satisfies a matching condition by the change of the positions of the objects. Hereinafter, puzzle-type electronic game processing in the present embodiment performed by execution of the electronic game program in the electronic game device 100 will be described along the flowchart of FIG. 3. At step S10, initial setting processing of the electronic game is performed. By the processing in this step, the electronic game device 100 functions as an initial setting unit. The processing unit 10 reads out information such as databases and image data necessary in the electronic game processing, from the storage unit 12. The databases used in the electronic game in the present embodiment are an object database, a matching condition database, a mission database, and a game effect database. In the object database, data related to the objects used in the electronic game is stored. Here, the objects are objects to be operated by the player in the game screen 200 of the puzzle-type electronic game. In the puzzle-type electronic game, a plurality of types of objects is used. Different types of objects have different symbols. In the object database, as illustrated in FIG. 4, object IDs and image data of the objects are registered as the data related to the objects. In the matching condition database, data related to a matching condition that indicates positional relationship of an object moved by the operation of the player with another object in the game screen 200 is stored. In the matching condition database, a matching ID, the matching condition, and an effect ID that identifies an effect on the game when the matching condition is satisfied are registered. The matching condition is expressed by, as illustrated in FIG. 5, a combination of a type of objects for satisfying the matching condition, a pattern to arrange the objects, and the number of times of operations for satisfying the matching condition. For example, as a matching condition with a matching ID identified by M1, a condition of arranging three or more objects P1 in a vertical direction or a horizontal direction as illustrated in FIG. 6A regardless of the number of times of operations is registered. Further, for example, as a matching condition with a matching ID identified by M6, a condition of arranging four or more object P1 in the vertical direction or the horizontal direction as illustrated in FIG. 6B in the second or subsequent operation (an operation of when extension of an operation time described below is performed once) is registered. Further, as a matching condition with a matching ID identified by M11, a condition of arranging five or more objects P1 in the vertical direction or the horizontal direction as illustrated in FIG. 6C in the third or subsequent operation (an operation of when extension of an operation time described below is performed once) is registered. The matching condition may be further registered. Note that the matching condition is not limited to the examples. A matching condition of arranging a determined number of different types of objects in a specific direction regardless of the order may be set. For example, in FIG. 5, as a matching condition with a matching ID identified by M16, a condition of arranging the objects P1, P2, and P3 in the vertical direction or the horizontal direction in a random order is registered. Further, a matching condition of arranging a specific number of different types of objects in a specific direction in a specific order may be set. For example, in FIG. 5, as a matching condition with a matching ID identified by M17, a condition of arranging the objects P1, P2, and P3 in the vertical direction or the horizontal direction in the order of the objects P1, P2, and P3 is registered. The pattern to arrange the objects is not limited to the vertical direction or the horizontal direction, and may be an arbitrary direction, such as a diagonal direction, an L-shaped pattern, or a T-shaped pattern. Further, the number of times of operations may also be arbitrarily set. In the mission database, a condition for completing each stage of the electronic game is stored. In the puzzle-type electronic game, a combination of the matching conditions to be achieved in each stage is stored. In the mission database, a combination of a stage ID and the matching IDs that indicate the matching conditions to be achieved in the stage, and an order of achieving the matching conditions are registered. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 7, a condition in which a stage with a stage ID of S1 is completed by satisfying of the matching conditions M1, M2, and M3 in a random order is set. Further, a condition in which a stage with a stage ID of S2 is completed by satisfying of the matching conditions M1, M3, and M5 in that order is set. The condition may be further registered. A mission may have a meaning on the game. For example, the objects used in the game are images of food ingredients, and creation of a specified dish is the mission of each stage. The stage is completed by matching of the objects of the food ingredients used in the dish. Further, for example, the objects used in the game are images of parts of vehicles, and creation of a specified type of vehicle is the mission of each stage. The stage is completed by matching of the objects of the parts suitable for the vehicle. Note that the mission is not limited to these examples. In the game effect database, an effect on the game to be provided according to the satisfied matching condition is stored. Examples of the effect on the game include, for example, providing a point to the player, and increasing the remaining number of the number of times of operating the objects. However, the effect is not limited to these examples. In the game effect database, as illustrated in FIG. 8, the matching ID that identifies the matching condition and the effect on the game are registered in association with each other. At step S12, display processing of the game screen 200 is performed. By the processing in this step, the electronic game device 100 functions as a game screen display unit. The processing unit 10 performs processing of generating the game screen 200 in which the objects as illustrated in FIG. 2 are arranged, and displaying the game screen 200 in the output unit 16. As for the objects arranged in the game screen 200, objects selected from the types of objects determined in advance for each stage of the game may just be randomly arranged. Further, initial arrangement of the objects in the game screen 200 may be set for each stage of the game. The position information (which column in the vertical direction and which row in the horizontal direction) of each object displayed in the game screen 200 is stored in the storage unit 12 in association with the type of the object. The position information is updated when the position of the object is changed in processing in an object position change unit at step S14 below. Further, by reference to the position information, whether the objects have satisfied the matching condition can be determined. At step S14, processing of receiving an operation input of objects. By the processing in this step, the electronic game device 100 functions as an object position change unit. The processing unit 10 receives an input of position change of the object from the player. For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 6A to 6C, assume that change of exchanging positions of adjacent objects in the game screen 200 is possible. When the input unit 14 is a touch panel, the object in a moving source and the object in a moving destination may just be exchanged by moving of a finger to the position of the object in the moving destination while touching the object in the moving source with the finger, in the game screen 200 displayed in the output unit 16. Note that a method of changing the positions of objects is not limited to the example, and may just satisfy a condition determined for each electronic game. Further, an operation to change the positions of objects may be made available within a range of an operable time or an operable number of times. For example, an operable time (one second, or the like) of one turn is set, and the input of change of the positions of objects may just be received as many times as desired as long as within the range of the operable time. Further, for example, an operable number of times (once, or the like) of one turn is set, and the input of change of the positions of objects may just be received as long as within the range of the operable number of times. When the processing unit 10 receives the operation input of objects, the processing unit 10 transfers the processing to step S16 before receiving the next operation input. At step S16, whether the matching condition has been established is determined. By the processing of this step, the electronic game device 100 functions as a matching processing unit. The processing unit 10 reads out the position information of each object in the game screen 200 from the storage unit 12, and determines whether any of the matching conditions registered in the matching condition database has been satisfied by the operation of objects received at step S14. When the positional relationship between the object moved by the operation of the player with another object on the game screen 200 is matched with the matching condition in the matching condition database, the processing unit 10 transfers the processing to step S18 or transfers the processing to step S20 otherwise. For example, when three or more objects P1 are arranged in the vertical direction or the horizontal direction as illustrated in FIG. 6A, the matching condition with the matching ID identified by M1 is satisfied. Therefore, the processing unit 10 transfers the processing to step S18. Further, for example, when four or more objects P1 are arranged in the vertical direction or the horizontal direction as illustrated in FIG. 6B in the second or subsequent operation of one turn, the matching condition with the matching ID identified by M6 is satisfied. Therefore, the processing unit 10 transfers the processing to step S18. The same applies to other conditions. At step S18, processing of extending reception of the operation is performed. By the processing in this step, the electronic game device 100 functions as an operation reception extension unit. When the matching condition has been determined to be newly established at step S16, the processing unit 10 increases the time or the number of times to receive the operation of objects at step S14 to extend the reception. For example, the processing unit 10 may clear an elapsed time and receive the input of change of the positions of objects as long as a cleared elapsed time is within a range of the operable time (one second or the like). Further, for example, the processing unit 10 may clear an operated number of times and receive the input of change of the positions of objects as long as a cleared operated number of times is within a range of the operable number of times (once or the like). Note that the extension of the reception of the operation is not limited to the example, and the time or the number of times to be extended may be increased or decreased every time the extension is repeated. Further, the time or the number of times to be extended may be increased or decreased according to the matching condition established at step S16. Further, the time or the number of times to be extended may be increased or decreased according to the stage or the mission of the electronic game. For example, when the matching condition with the matching ID identified by M1 has been established by arranging of three objects P1, processing of providing a point according to the matching condition is performed in a conventional electronic game. However, according to the present embodiment, reception of the operation of objects is further extended. Therefore, by increasing of one another object P1 to arrange four objects P1, the matching condition with the matching ID identified by M6 or another matching condition can be established. When the matching condition with the matching ID identified by M6, or the another matching condition has been established, the reception of the operation of objects is further extended. Therefore, by increasing of one another object P1 to arrange five objects P1, the matching condition with the matching ID identified by M11 or another matching condition can be established. As described above, by extending of the reception of the operation when the matching condition is established, the objects can be operated to establish another matching condition after the matching condition has been established. Therefore, strategic characteristics of the puzzle-type electronic game can be enhanced. Accordingly, an electronic game that the player will not easily get bored with can be provided. At step S20, whether the reception of the operation of objects in one turn is terminated is determined. The processing unit 10 determines whether the range of the operable time or the operable number of times in which the operation of change of the positions of objects in one turn is possible has been exceeded. The processing unit 10 transfers the processing to step S22 if exceeded, or transfers the processing to step S14 otherwise and repeats the processing from the reception of the operation. At this time, when the extension of the reception of the operation has been performed at step S18, the determination is performed in consideration of the extension. At step S22, processing of providing an effect on the game is performed. By the processing of this step, the electronic game device 100 functions as a game effect providing unit. The processing unit 10 performs processing of providing an effect on the game registered in association with the matching condition determined to be satisfied at step S16, by reference to the game effect database. At this time, the processing unit 10 may provide only an effect on the game according to a finally satisfied matching condition, or may provide effects on the game according to all of the matching conditions satisfied in the operations of one turn. At step S24, whether the stage has been completed is determined. By the processing of this step, the electronic game device 100 functions as a mission determination processing unit. The processing unit 10 determines whether a condition for completing the mission on the current stage has been satisfied, by reference to the mission database. For example, at a stage with the stage ID of S1, the mission is determined to be completed when all of the matching conditions with the matching IDs identified by M1, M2, and M3 are satisfied at the stage. When the mission has been completed, the processing unit 10 recognizes that the stage has been completed, and puts the processing back to step S12 and starts processing of the next stage. When the mission has not been completed, the processing unit 10 transfers the processing to step S26. Meanwhile, when the number of turns in which the player can operate the objects becomes 0, the processing unit 10 terminates the game. At step S26, processing of updating the game screen is performed. By the processing in this step, the electronic game device 100 functions as a game screen update unit. At step S16, the processing unit 10 performs processing of erasing the objects with which the matching condition has been established, from the game screen 200, and displaying new objects at the positions of the erased objects. The newly displayed objects may be randomly selected from the types of objects determined in advance for each stage of the game, or may be selected according to a rule determined in advance. When the update of the game screen 200 is terminated, the processing unit 10 puts the processing back to step S14. As described above, the electronic game processing method in the puzzle-type electronic game in the present embodiment is executed. At this time, by extending of the reception of the operation when the matching condition is established, the objects can be further operated to establish another matching condition. Accordingly, the strategic characteristics of the puzzle-type electronic game can be enhanced, and an electronic game that the player will not easily get bored with can be provided. Modification 1 A matching condition may include a changing direction of positions of objects received in an object position change unit, as a condition. The changing direction of positions of objects is a direction in which objects are exchanged in the game screen 200. For example, the changing directions of positions of objects in the cases of FIGS. 6A and 6C are a vertical direction, and the changing direction of positions of objects in the case of FIG. 6B is a horizontal direction. For example, as illustrated in an example of a matching condition database of FIG. 9, an operating direction of objects may be added, in addition to a combination of objects, a direction of matching the objects, an order, the number of times of operations, and the like. Then, whether the direction of a final operation, with which a matching condition of positional relationship of objects is satisfied, satisfies the condition of the operating direction may be added. As a specific example, when three objects P1 are matched as illustrated in FIG. 6A, conditions of “P1, P1, P1” as the combination of objects, and “vertical direction” as the direction of matching the objects are satisfied, and further the final operating direction with which these conditions are satisfied is “vertical direction”. Therefore, a matching condition M1 is satisfied. Meanwhile, when four objects P1 are matched as illustrated in FIG. 6B, conditions of “P1, P1, P1, P1” as the combination of objects, “vertical direction” as the direction of matching the objects, and “within twice” as the number of times of operations are satisfied. However, the final operating direction with which these conditions are satisfied is “horizontal direction”, and thus a matching condition M6 is not satisfied. As described above, by adding of the condition of operating objects and changing the positions, strategic characteristics of a puzzle-type electronic game can be enhanced. Note that a combination of a type of objects and the operating direction can have a meaning to enhance enjoyment of the game. For example, when a mission to create some sort of dish is provided, a meaning can be given, in which a way of cooking is different between a case where the objects of food ingredients are operated in the horizontal direction and a case where the objects of food ingredients are operated in the vertical direction, and a matching condition is satisfied in one case but is not satisfied in the other case. Modification 2 A matching condition may include a mission for completing a stage, as a condition. For example, as illustrated in an example of a matching condition database of FIG. 10, a mission determined for each stage may be added to the condition, in addition to a combination of objects, a direction of matching the objects, an order, the number of times of operations, and the like. As a specific example, when three objects P1 are matched as illustrated in FIG. 6A, conditions of “P1, P1, P1” as the combination of objects, and “vertical direction” as the direction of matching the objects are satisfied, and in addition, if the mission of the current stage is “curry” or “soup”, a matching condition M1 is satisfied. Meanwhile, if the mission is “fried rice” or “hamburger”, the matching condition M1 is not satisfied. As described above, by adding of the condition of operating objects and changing the positions, strategic characteristics of a puzzle-type electronic game can be enhanced. Note that a combination of a type of objects and the operating direction can have a meaning to enhance enjoyment of the game. For example, when a mission to create some sort of dish is provided, a meaning can be given, in which a matching condition is satisfied only when the objects of food ingredients having a possibility to be used in the dish are matched, and the matching condition is not satisfied when the objects of food ingredients having a low possibility of being used in the dish are matched. Modification 3 Further, an object change unit that changes objects that have satisfied a condition to other objects, when the matching condition is satisfied by change of positions of the objects. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 11, a plurality of objects is registered in association with one another as an object database, and when a matching condition related to the objects has been satisfied, the objects related to the satisfied matching condition are changed to other objects registered in the object database in association with the objects. As a specific example, when three objects P1 are matched as illustrated in FIG. 6A, a matching condition with a matching ID of M1 is satisfied. Therefore, the objects P1 related to the matching condition satisfied in a game screen 200 are changed to objects P11 registered in the object database in association with the objects P1. To be specific, as illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 12, when reception of operations of one turn is terminated at step S20, a processing unit 10 performs processing of referring to the object database, reading out image data of other objects from a storage unit 12 if the other objects are registered in association with the objects related to the matching condition that has been established in the current turn, and changing the objects in the game screen 200 to the other objects. At this time, position information (which column in the vertical direction and which row in the horizontal direction) of the new objects displayed in the game screen 200 is stored in the storage unit 12. Further, by registering of a matching condition related to the object P11 in a matching condition database, processing of further changing the objects, providing an effect on the game, and advancing the game becomes possible by satisfying of the matching condition related to the object P11. Note that a meaning may be given between the objects before change and the objects after change to enhance enjoyment of the game. For example, when a mission to create some sort of dish is provided, a meaning can be given, in which, when a matching condition including objects of a food ingredient having a possibility of being used in the dish is satisfied, the objects are changed to objects of another food ingredient created using the food ingredient. To be specific, a meaning can be given, in which, when objects of “tomato” are matched and the matching condition is satisfied, the objects of “tomato” are changed to objects of “tomato juice”, and further, when the objects of “tomato juice” are matched and the matching condition is satisfied, the objects of “tomato juice” are changed to objects of “tomato ketchup”, and the like can be given. At this time, to complete the mission, satisfying a matching condition of m “tomato ketchup” is set to the condition, a player needs to solve puzzles to change the objects “tomato”→“tomato juice”→“tomato ketchup”, and thus strategic characteristics of the electronic game can be enhanced. 1.
