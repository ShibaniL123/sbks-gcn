BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field Provided are a fusion protein including granzyme B, a cell penetrating peptide, a cleavage site of a peptidase or protease, and a targeting moiety, a pharmaceutical composition for cell membrane penetration including the fusion protein, and an anticancer composition including the fusion protein. 2. Description of the Related Art It has been generally required in various clinical circumstances to specifically kill a cancer cell. A number of intracellular signal transduction pathways are associated with cell death and cell survival, and thus cell death and cell survival can be controlled by controlling pathways associated with cell death and survival. The pathways can be successfully controlled by the successful delivery of a substance that restricts or blocks the pathway. A representative example of the signal transduction pathways is an apoptosis pathway. Thus, the elements related to the apoptosis pathway are useful as a target to specifically destroy a particular cell. Granzyme B (GrB), a serine protease, is found in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. Granzyme B relates to apoptosis which is induced in a target cell when it is exposed to the contents of lysosome-type cytoplasmic granules (or lytic granules). Cytotoxic T lymphocyte granules include a series of serine proteases including perforin, a pore-forming protein, and granzymes. In a lymphocyte-mediated cell lysis, perforin has been known to insert itself into a plasma membrane of a target cell and polymerize, forming a pore, thereby mediating the access of granzyme B into the cytoplasm of the target cell. Once granzyme B is introduced inside of a cell, it directly activates a caspase and induces rapid DNA destruction, thereby inducing cellular apoptosis. Granzymes are structurally related to each other, but have different substrate preferences. Among the various granzymes, granzyme B has a particular activity to cleave a procaspase after an aspartic acid residue. and causes the maturation (i.e., activation) of the procapsase into caspase-3, thereby exhibiting a high cytotoxicity to a target cell inducing cellular apoptosis. Granzyme B directly activates caspases under certain conditions, directly damaging downstream caspase substrates, to trigger apoptosis. Recently, various technologies to introduce macromolecules such as proteins into cells have been developed and are central to certain new therapies. However, exact targeting of a cell or tissue is difficult using existing technologies. In an effort to solve this problem, there have been many studies conducted regarding the cell membrane penetration of therapeutic proteins. It has recently been found that a TAT protein of HIV-1 which is added to a cell culture medium can be delivered inside of a cell, and thus, the protein has been known as a protein transduction domain (PTD). PTD can be transferred into a cell together with other peptide or proteins which are fused thereto. Thus, there have been various attempts to transfer therapeutic drugs, peptides, and proteins into a cell using the PTD. It is required to develop a technology for intracellular delivery of a cytotoxic substance such as granzyme B using a protein transduction domain.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION To more effectively treat a cancer, a fusion protein for intracellular delivery of granzyme B is provided, wherein granzyme B exhibiting an anticancer effect and a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) for successfully delivering granzyme B into a cancer cell are fused (conjugated), and a more effective anticancer effect can be achieved by delivering the designed fusion protein into a cancer cell. An embodiment provides a fusion protein comprising (1) granzyme B, (2) a cell penetrating peptide (CPP), (3) a cleavage site of a peptidase or protease, and (4) a targeting moiety. Granzyme B, which is a serine protease, is expressed in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cell, and plays an important role in inducing apoptosis of a target cell in cell-mediate immune response. Granzyme B has strong cytotoxicity. It is inactivated in a normal cell, but specifically activated in a cancer cell or a virus-infected cell by being cleaved at a specific site by a specific enzyme such as cathepsin, which is rich in a cancer cell or virus-infected cell such cell, to exhibit cytotoxicity. Therefore, granzyme B is harmless to a normal cell but has specific and strong cytotoxicity to a cancer cell, and thus, it is advantageous for more effective cancer therapy with safety to a normal cell. Granzyme B (EC number: 3.4.21.79) may be from a mammal, for example a primate (such as human, a monkey, etc.), a rodent (such as a mouse, rat, etc.), and the like. For example, granzyme B may be selected from the group consisting of a human granzyme B comprising the amino acid sequence of Accession number NP—004122 or an amino acid sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence (mRNA) of Accession number NM—004131, and a mouse granzyme B comprising the amino acid sequence of Accession number NP—038570, or a combination thereof; but not be limited thereto. In the fusion protein, the granzyme B may be a full-length granzyme B or a fragment of granzyme B. The fragment of granzyme B may comprise an active region (e.g., “IIGGHEAKPHSRPYMAYLMIWDQKSLKRCGGFLIQDDFVLTAAHCWGSSINVTLGAHN IKEQEPTQQFIPVKRPIPHPAYNPKNFSNDIMLLQLERKAKRTRAVQPLRLPSNKAQVKP GQTCSVAGWGQTAPLGKHSHTLQEVKMTVQEDRKCESDLRHYYDSTIELCVGDPEIKK TSFKGDSGGPLVCNKVAQGIVSYGRNNGMPPRACTKVSSFVHWIKKTMKRH”: SEQ ID NO: 11) and cleavage sequence (or a cleavage inducing sequence; for example, a cathepsin cleavage sequence or an auto-cleavage (self-cleavage) sequence cleaved by auto-activation (self-activation) of granzyme B). The granzyme B is activated by cleavage by a dipeptidyl peptidase I (DPPI), which is a representative cysteine-based protease found in ribosomes, or auto-activated (self-activated). The dipeptidyl peptidase I may be cathepsin C or cathepsin H. Cathepsin C can exhibit its activity, unless (i) the amino group at the N-terminus of granzyme B is blocked, (ii) any amino acid residue of the cleavage site is proline, (iii) the amino acid residue at the N-terminus of granzyme B is lysine or arginine, or (iv) the structure of a peptide of protein disturbs cleavage (e.g., by a folding of a peptide or protein preventing the cleavage site from being exposed). The auto-activation (self-activation) of granzyme B may be induced by presence or artificial insertion of an auto-activation inducing sequence (e.g., “IEPD (SEQ ID NO: 36”). For example, the cleavage sequence in the fragment of granzyme B may be a cathepsin cleavage site (for example, a cleavage site of Dipeptidyl peptidase I) of granzyme B, such as the native granzyme B DPPI cleavage site (e.g., “GE”). Also, the cleavage sequence may be provided by a peptide comprising an amino acid sequence (auto-cleavage sequence; e.g., IEPD (SEQ ID NO: 36), etc.) which is artificially linked (e.g., a non-native peptide) to an active region of granzyme B and induces an auto-activation and cleavage of granzyme B itself whereby the cleavage sequence (e.g., IEPD) is removed. In order to be cleaved by an enzyme such as cathepsin, the cleavage sequence (peptide) may be exposed to N-terminus. Therefore, in the fragment of granzyme B, the cleavage sequence may be linked to N-terminus of the active region of granzyme B. In an embodiment, the fragment of granzyme B may comprise: 1) an active region of granzyme B and 2) at least one cleavage sequence, for example, at least one cleavage sequence of dipeptidyl peptidase I (cleavage site recognized by dipeptidyl peptidase I) or at least one auto-cleavage sequence, wherein the cleavage sequence comprises or consists essentially of about 2 to about 20 amino acids, about 2 to about 15 amino acids, or about 2 to about 10 amino acids, comprising contiguous amino acids ‘GE’, ‘IEPD’ (SEQ ID NO: 36), or a combination thereof, wherein the cleavage site is linked to N-terminus of the active region of granzyme B. As used herein, the term “cleavage sequence” in the fragment of granzyme B is used to be distinguished from the term “cleavage site of a peptidase or protease” positioned between a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) and a targeting moiety in a fusion protein described herein. In order to be recognized by an enzyme such as cathepsin and activated, granzyme B may preferably have an exposed N-terminus. More specifically, the N-terminus of the cleavage sequence of granzyme B or the fragment of granzyme B should be exposed. Therefore, in the fusion protein, granzyme B or the fragment of granzyme B comprising the cleavage sequence, may be positioned at N-terminal part of the fusion protein. The cell penetrating peptide may be any peptide capable of penetrating cell membrane, and for example, at least one selected from the group consisting of a membrane-translocation sequence (MTS) or a fragment thereof (wherein the fragment comprises 5 or more contiguous amino acid residues in the membrane-translocation sequence), a macromolecule intracellular transduction domain (MTD), TAT peptide (e.g., YGRKKRRQRRR; SEQ ID NO: 24), RKKRRQRRR (SEQ ID NO: 25)), MTD103 (LALPVLLLA; SEQ ID NO: 26), TP10 (AGYLLGKINLKALAALAKKIL; SEQ ID NO: 27), Penetratin (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK; SEQ ID NO: 28), MAP (model amphipathic peptide; e.g., KLALKLALKALKAALKLA (SEQ ID NO: 29)), a cell penetrating fusion peptide comprising a hydrophobic peptide and a basic peptide, or any combination thereof. For example, the membrane-translocation sequence may comprise or consist essentially of the amino acid sequence of AAVALLPAVLLALLAP (SEQ ID NO: 12), but not be limited thereto. The fragment thereof may be a peptide comprising or consisting essentially of about 7 to about 16 contiguous amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12, and for example, a peptide comprising or consisting essentially of AAVALLP (SEQ ID NO: 13) or AVLLALLAP (SEQ ID NO: 14), but not be limited thereto. The cell penetrating fusion peptide of a hydrophobic peptide and a basic peptide may comprise or consist essentially of: a hydrophobic peptide comprising a total of about 5 to about 100 amino acids, about 5 to about 50 amino acids, about 5 to about 40 amino acids, or about 6 to 30 amino acids, wherein the hydrophobic peptide comprises hydrophobic amino acids at the ratio of about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, or about 90% or more, for example, about 60 to about 100%, about 70 to about 100%, about 80 to about 100%, or about 90 to about 100%, based on the number of the total amino acids in the hydrophobic peptide; and a basic peptide comprising a basic peptide unit comprising about 1 to about 6 basic amino acids or a repeat comprising about 2 to about 6 basic peptide units. In the cell penetrating fusion peptide, the hydrophobic peptide may comprise a total of about 5 to about 100 amino acids, about 5 to about 50 amino acids, about 5 to about 40 amino acids, or about 6 to about 30 amino acids, and comprise a hydrophobic amino acid at the ratio of about 60% or more, about 70% or more, about 80% or more, or about 90% or more, for example, about 60 to about 100%, about 70 to about 100%, about 80 to about 100%, or about 90 to about 100%, based on the number of the total amino acids in the hydrophobic peptide. The hydrophobic amino acid may be at least one selected from the group consisting of glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, proline, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and the like, or any combination thereof. When the hydrophobic peptide includes one kind of hydrophobic amino acid, the hydrophobic amino acid may be included once or repeatedly. In addition, in some embodiments the hydrophobic peptide may not comprise any basic amino acid. In an embodiment, the hydrophobic peptide may be at least one selected from the group consisting of a membrane-translocation sequence (MTS, e.g., AAVALLPAVLLALLAP; SEQ ID NO: 12), a fragment of the membrane-translocation sequence (for example, a peptide fragment including about 7 to about 16 consecutive amino acids within the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1; e.g., AAVALLP (SEQ ID NO: 13), AVLLALLAP (SEQ ID NO: 14), etc.), and the like or any combination thereof. The basic peptide may comprise or consist essentially of a basic peptide unit comprising about 1 to about 6 basic amino acids, or a repeat comprising about 2 to about 6 basic peptide units. When the basic peptide includes 2 or more basic amino acids, the basic amino acids are the same with or different from one another. If the basic peptide comprises 7 or more amino acids, the basic peptide acts as a cell penetrating peptide in itself, thereby transferring a protein (e.g., granzyme B) to an endosome, which can lead to the degradation of the protein (e.g., granzyme B). Therefore, it may be advantageous that the basic peptide includes 6 or less amino acid. The basic peptide may play a role to induce transfer of granzyme B into a nucleus. The basic amino acid may be at least one selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, and the like, or any combination thereof. When the basic peptide includes two or more basic amino acids, each of the basic amino acids may be independently selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, and the like. When the basic peptide includes one kind of basic amino acid, the basic amino acid may be included once or repeatedly. When the basic peptide comprises about 2 to about 6 basic peptide units, the basic peptide units may be comprise the same amino acid sequence with or different basic peptide units from one another. In a particular embodiment, the basic peptide unit may comprise lysine (K), arginine (R), or a combination thereof, in about 1 to about 6 amino acids in length. For example, the basic peptide unit may be at least one selected from the group consisting of KKKRK (SEQ ID NO: 15), KKKR (SEQ ID NO: 16), RKRK (SEQ ID NO: 17), RKRKRK (SEQ ID NO: 18), KKKKK (SEQ ID NO: 19), KKKKKR (SEQ ID NO: 20), KKKRKR (SEQ ID NO: 21), R5 (RRRRR) (SEQ ID NO: 22), R6 (RRRRRR) (SEQ ID NO: 23), and the like, or any combination thereof, but not be limited thereto. Some of the basic peptides have been known to have a nuclear membrane penetrating activity; however, none of them has been known to have a cell membrane penetrating activity. In the present invention, the basic peptide is fused with a hydrophobic peptide, to produce a cell penetrating fusion peptide, thereby considerably increasing the cell membrane penetrating effect of the hydrophobic peptide and thus increases the cell penetrating ability of the fusion peptide comprising granzyme B. The basic peptide may be linked (e.g., covalently) to the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the hydrophobic peptide, or respectively linked to both of the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the hydrophobic peptide (when two or more basic peptides are included). One particular embodiment, in order to more increase the cell membrane penetrability, the basic peptide may be linked to the N-terminus or the C-terminus, for example the C-terminus, of the hydrophobic peptide. When two or more basic peptides are respectively linked to both termini of the hydrophobic peptide, the basic peptides may be the same with or different from one another. In a particular embodiment, the cell penetrating fusion peptide may comprise or consist essentially of: a hydrophobic peptide and a basic peptide which is linked to the C-terminus of the hydrophobic peptide (that is, in the cell penetrating fusion peptide, a hydrophobic peptide is located at a N-terminal part and a basic peptide is located at a C-terminal part), or a hydrophobic peptide and a basic peptide which is linked to N-terminus of the hydrophobic peptide (that is, in the cell penetrating fusion peptide, a hydrophobic peptide is located at a C-terminal part and a basic peptide is located at a N-terminal part. To increase the cell membrane penetrability of the cell penetrating fusion peptide, the cell penetrating fusion peptide may comprise a hydrophobic peptide and a basic peptide which is linked to the C-terminus of the hydrophobic peptide. The cell penetrating fusion peptide may exhibit more excellent cell penetrability than pre-existing cell penetrating peptides, and thus, it may be useful in intracellular delivery of the fusion protein comprising granzyme B or a fragment thereof. The cleavage site of a peptidase or protease may be located between the cell penetrating peptide and a targeting moiety in a fusion protein, and may be capable of being cleaved under proper conditions (e.g., presence and/or activation of the peptidase or protease). By such cleavage, a cell penetrating peptide can be released from a targeting moiety having relatively large molecular weight, whereby the cell penetrating peptide can exhibit a cell penetrating activity, thereby achieving a cell penetration and intracellular delivery of granzyme B which is attached (linked) to the cell penetrating peptide. In order to ensure the specificity of granzyme B to a cancer cell, the cleavage site may be cleaved by a peptidase or protease present specifically in a cancer cell. The peptidase or protease present specifically in a cancer cell may be a cancer cell-specific cleavage enzyme which is secreted specifically in a cancer cell or located specifically on cell membrane of a cancer cell (e.g., exposed to outside of cell membrane), and for example, endopeptidase. The cancer cell-specific cleavage enzyme may be at least one selected from the group consisting of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP; e.g., MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP8, MMP9, MMP10, MMP11, MMP12, MMP13, MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17, MMP18, MMP19, MMP20, MMP21, MMP23A, MMP23B, MMP24, MMP25, MMP26, MMP27, MMP28, etc.), cathepsin C, cathepsin H, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and the like, or any combination thereof. The cleavage site may be any cleavage (recognition) site of the cancer cell-specific cleavage enzyme. In a particular example, the cleavage site may be a cleavage (recognition) site of MMP9 (e.g., SGKIPRTLTA; SEQ ID NO: 35), but not be limited thereto. The targeting moiety may be a domain capable of specifically targeting a target cell or target tissue, and for example, it may be a substance capable of targeting a specific cell such as a cancer cell or a specific tissue such as a cancer tissue. One or more targeting moieties may be incorporated into the fusion protein comprising granzyme B. For example, the targeting moiety may be comprised at both of C-terminus and N-terminus of a fusion protein comprising granzyme B, where the targeting moieties at C-terminus and N-terminus may be the same with or different to each other, but not be limited thereto. The targeting moiety may be at least one selected from the group consisting of an antibody, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody, a protein scaffold such as a DARPin, and the like, or any combination thereof. The antibody or the protein scaffold may be one specifically recognizing or binding to at least one selected from the group consisting of signal transduction substances (e.g., various growth factors, etc.), receptors (e.g., receptor tyrosine kinase proteins, etc.), and the like, which are present or overexpressed specifically in a target cell (e.g., a cancer cell). The protein scaffold may be a protein construct characterized by having a similar structure to a protein or specifically recognizing or binding a specific protein or a specific cell. For example, the protein scaffold may be selected from the group consisting of a DARPin, an affibody, a lasso scaffold, a cyclotide, a knottin, an avimer (short for avidity multimer), a Kunitz domain, an anticalin, an adnectin, a pronectin, a fynomer, a nanofitin, an affilin, and the like, or any combination thereof, but not limited thereto. Examples of the growth factor may selected from the group consisting of epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the like. Examples of the receptor tyrosine kinase protein may include receptors of various growth factors, and for example, be selected from the group consisting of an ErbB family such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), HER2, HER3, etc., insulin receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) such as c-Met, tropomyosin-receptor-kinase (Trk) receptor, Ephrin (Eph) receptor, AXL receptor, Leukocyte receptor tyrosine kinase (LTK) receptor, TIE receptor, receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan (ROR) receptor, discoidin domain receptor (DDR), RET receptor, KLG receptor, related to receptor tyrosine kinase (RYK) receptor, Muscle-Specific Kinase (MuSK) receptor, and the like. The antibody may be from any subtype immunoglobulin (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4), or IgM), which recognizes at least one selected from the group consisting of various signal transduction substances, various receptors, and the like, present or overexpressed specifically in a target cell, as an antigen. The antigen-binding fragment may be a polypeptide comprising a part of an antibody, which is responsible for specific binding to the antigen. The antigen-binding fragment may be a heavy chain CDR (complementarity determining region), a light chain CDR, a heavy chain variable region, a light chain variable region, or a combination thereof (e.g., scFv, (scFv)2, scFv-Fc, Fab, Fab′, or F(ab′)2). In a particular embodiment, the targeting moiety may be an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody, such as scFv or scFv-Fc. DARPin (designed ankyrin repeat protein) refers to an antibody mimetic protein having high specificity and high binding affinity to a target protein, which is prepared via genetic engineering. DARPin is originated from natural ankyrin protein, and has a structure comprising at least 2 ankyrin repeat motifs, for example, comprising at least 3, 4 or 5 ankyrin repeat motifs. The DARPin can have any suitable molecular weight depending on the number of repeat motifs. For example, the DARPins including 3, 4 or 5 ankyrin repeat motifs may have a molecular weight of about 10 kDa, about 14 kDa, or about 18 kDa, respectively. DARPin includes a structural core that provides structure and a target binding portion that resides outside of the core and binds to a target. The structural core includes a conserved amino acid sequence and the target binding portion includes an amino acid sequence that differs depending on the target. Since the DARPin has high affinity to an antigen (target), and higher stability and smaller molecular weight, it has advantageous properties (such as pharmacokinetic (PK) properties in the living body) and stability in the living body. In addition, the DARPin can be readily fused with other proteins. Therefore, the DARPin can be useful in preparing a fusion protein having excellent properties such as increased stability in vivo The fusion protein may comprise at least one DARPin, for example, about 1 to about 10, about 1 to about 5, or about 1 to about 3 DARPins, which include the same amino acid sequence, or at least two kinds of DARPins, for example, about 2 to about 10, about 2 to about 5, or about 2 to about 3 kinds of DARPins, which include different amino acid sequences and target the same or different antigens. Examples of DARPins are summarized in the following table and the nucleotide sequences thereof are illustrated in FIGS. 5A to 5G and SEQ ID NOs: 37-68: Target protein DARPins Human IgG1-Fc I_01/02/07/11/13/19 TNF-alpha T_01/02/07/08/09/16/25/27/37/40 ErbB1 (EGFR) E_01/67/68/69 ErbB2 (1-509) 9_16/26/29 ErbB2 (1-631) H_14 ErbB4 B4_01/02/07/33/45/50/58 CitS cp34_15/16 In an embodiment, the targeting moiety may be an anti-EGFR DARPin which targets EGFR. The anti-EGFR DARPin may be any DARPin having DARPin's own unique structure and specifically binding to EGFR. For example, the anti-EGFR DARPin may be at least one selected from the group consisting of the following 4 anti-EGFR DARPins: anti-EGFR DARPin-01 (SEQ ID NO: 30): dlgkklleaaragqddevrilmangadvnaddtwgwtplhlaayqg hleivevllkngadvnaydyigwtplhlaadghleivevllkngad vnasdyigdtplhlaahnghleivevllkhgadvnaqdkfgktafd isidngnedlaeilq anti-EGFR DARPin-67 (SEQ ID NO: 31): dlgkklleaaragqddevrilmangadvnatdndgntplhlsawig hleivevllkhgadvnaddllgmtplhlaadtghleivevllkyga dvnardtrgktplhlaardghleivevllkhdadvnaqdkfgktaf disidngnedlaeilq anti-EGFR DARPin-68 (SEQ ID NO: 32): dlgkklleaaragqddevrilmangadvnafdywgmtplhlaadng hleivevllkhgadvnasdnfgftplhlaafyghleivevllkhga dvnafdmwgntplhlaaqnghleivevllkngadvnaqdkfgktaf disidngnedlaeilq anti-EGFR DARPin-69 (SEQ ID NO: 33): dlgkklleaaragqddevrilmangadvnaddnagrtplhlaanfg hleivevllkngadvnakghhcntplhlaawaghleivevllkyga dvnadddegytplhlaadigdleivevllkygadvnawdmygrtpl hlaasaghleivevllkygadvnaqdkfgktafdisidngnedlae ilq In the fusion protein, granzyme B may be located so that it is exposed at N-terminus of the fusion peptide, in order to be activated by an enzyme specifically present in a cancer cell, and the cleavage site of a peptidase or protease may be located between a cell penetrating peptide and targeting moiety, and cleaved when specifically reaching a cancer cell by the targeting moiety, thereby releasing the cell penetrating peptide from the targeting moiety to activate a cell membrane penetrating activity of the cell penetrating peptide. In addition, granzyme B may be linked to the cell penetrating peptide so that it penetrates through a cell membrane together with the activated cell penetrating peptide and moves inside of a cell. Therefore, the fusion protein may comprise or consist essentially of, in order from N-terminus to C-terminus, (1) granzyme B, (2) a cell penetrating peptide (CPP), (3) a cleavage site of a peptidase or protease, and (4) a targeting moiety. As described above, when granzyme B is a fragment of granzyme B comprising an active region of granzyme B and a cleavage sequence, the fusion protein may comprise or consist essentially of, in order from N-terminus to C-terminus, (1′) a fragment of ‘(a cleavage sequence)-(an active region of granzyme B)’, (2) a cell penetrating peptide (CPP), (3) a cleavage site of a peptidase or protease, and (4) a targeting moiety. The components of a fusion protein (i.e., granzyme B, a cell penetrating peptide, a cleavage site of a peptidase or protease, and a targeting moiety), or a hydrophobic peptide and a basic peptide of a cell penetrating fusion peptide, may be independently linked to each other through a peptide linker or directly linked to each other with no linker. The peptide linker may be a peptide comprising about 1 to about 20 amino acids or about 2 to about 10 amino acids. The peptide linker may comprise at least one amino acid residue, and when the peptide linker comprises two or more amino acid residues, each residue may be independently selected from the group consisting of Gly, Asn, Ser, Thr, Ala, and the like. For example, the peptide linker may be (GS)n (wherein n is an integer from 1 to 5), but not be limited thereto. Several appropriate amino acid sequences usefully employed as the peptide linker are well known to the relevant art. Each of the components may be linked to each other via a covalent bond such as a peptide bond, which is generally present in a protein. granzyme B comprised in a fusion protein has a very strong cytotoxicity, allowing to effectively kill cancer cells, however it may exhibit a fatal cytotoxicity to normal cells. Therefore, a targeting to a cancer cell and a target-specific activity of granzyme B are very important in the fusion protein. For this, the fusion protein employs a multiple safety mechanism for a cancer cell specific activation of granzyme B, comprising (1) a targeting to a cancer cell by a targeting moiety, (2) a cancer cell specific cleavage at a cleavage site and an activation of a cell penetrating peptide by such cleavage, and (3) a use of granzyme B, which is activated by cathepsin present specifically in or by itself a cancer cell. Therefore, the fusion protein can achieve an increased efficacy of granzyme B in delivery to a cancer cell, cancer cell specific cell membrane penetration, and/or intracellular delivery into a cancer cell, and thus, it can be useful for intracellular delivery of granzyme B or for killing a cancer cell.

Another embodiment provides a composition for cell membrane penetration of granzyme B, comprising a fusion protein. Another embodiment provides a composition for intracellular delivery of granzyme B, comprising a fusion protein. The cell to which the composition is delivered may be a cell of a diseased region such as a cancer cell. Another embodiment provides a method for intracellular delivery (or cell membrane penetration) of granzyme B using a fusion protein. The method for intracellular delivery or cell membrane penetration may comprise administering a fusion protein to a subject in need of intracellular delivery or cell membrane penetration of granzyme B. An embodiment provides an anticancer composition comprising a fusion protein as an active ingredient. Another embodiment provides a method of preventing and/or treating a cancer comprising administering a fusion protein to a subject in need of preventing and/or treating a cancer. In the method, the fusion protein may be administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. The method may further comprise a step of identifying a subject in need of preventing and/or treating a cancer, prior to the step of administering. The step of identifying may comprise determining whether or not a subject needs prevention and/or treatment of a cancer (e.g., a subject is suffered from a cancer). The subject may be any animal selected from mammals such as primates including human, monkeys, etc., rodents including rats, mice, etc., and the like; a cell, a tissue, or body fluid (e.g., blood, serum) derived (isolated) from the animal; or a culture thereof. The subject may be an animal, or a cell, a tissue, or body fluid derived (isolated) from the animal, which is in need of delivery (e.g., intracellular delivery) of granzyme B included in the fusion protein. The fusion protein may be administered to a subject in need of administration of granzyme B, via oral or parenteral route, or administered by being contacted with a cell, tissue, or body fluid isolated from the subject.

Parenteral administration may be performed by intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection, muscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, endothelial administration, local administration, intranasal administration, intrapulmonary administration, and/or rectal administration. Since oral administration leads to digestion of proteins or peptides, an active ingredient in the compositions for oral administration must be coated or formulated to prevent digestion in stomach. In addition, the fusion protein may be in a form of solution in oil or an aqueous medium, suspension, syrup, or emulsifying solution form, or may be formulated into a form of an extract, powders, granules, a tablet or a capsule. The cell membrane penetrating conjugate may further include a dispersing agent and/or a stabilizing agent for its formulation. Another embodiment provides a method of improving (increasing) a cell membrane penetrability of granzyme B, wherein the method comprises preparing a fusion protein comprising (1) granzyme B, (2) a cell penetrating peptide (CPP), (3) a cleavage site, and (4) a targeting moiety. Another embodiment provides a method of preparing granzyme B derivative having increased cell membrane penetrability, wherein the method comprises preparing s fusion protein comprising (1) granzyme B, (2) a cell penetrating peptide (CPP), (3) a cleavage site, and (4) a targeting moiety. The step of preparing a fusion protein may be conducted ex vivo. Each component of the fusion protein may be independently linked to each other through a peptide linker or directly linked to each other with no linker, as described above. The preparation of the fusion protein may be performed by any general method for preparing a protein, such as a chemical synthesis of a protein, a protein expression using an expression (recombinant) vector comprising (carrying) polynucleotides encoding each component of the fusion protein (in a proper host cell), and the like. Thus, also provided herein is a polynucleotide encoding the fusion protein described herein, optionally in an expression (recombinant) vector, as well as a method of producing the fusion protein comprising expressing the polynucleotide encoding the fusion protein in a cell or culturing a recombinant cell comprising (harboring) the polynucleotide encoding the fusion protein to express the polynucleotide. Each component of the fusion protein, i.e., granzyme B, a cell penetrating peptide, a cleavage site, and a targeting moiety, is described above. As used herein, the term “vector” refers to a means for expressing a gene of interest in a host cell, as exemplified by a plasmid vector, a cosmid vector, and a viral vector, such as a bacteriophage vector, an adenovirus vector, a retrovirus vector and an adeno-associated virus vector. The recombinant vector may be constructed from well-known plasmids (for example, pSC101, pGV1106, pACYC177, ColE1, pKT230, pME290, pBR322, pUC8/9, pUC6, pBD9, pHC79, pIJ6l, pLAFR1, pHV14, pGEX series, pET series, pUC19, etc.), phages (for example, λgt4λB, λ-Charon, λΔz1, M13, etc.) or viruses (for example, SV40, etc.) by known manipulation (genetic engineering) techniques. In the recombinant vector, the polynucleotide encoding the protein conjugate may be operatively linked to a promoter. The term “operatively linked” is intended to pertain to a functional linkage between a nucleotide sequence of interest and an expression regulatory element (for example, a promoter sequence) so that the expression of the nucleotide sequence of interest is governed by the regulatory element. For instance, when it is “operatively linked” to the regulatory element, the nucleotide sequence of interest can be transcribed and/or translated under the control of the regulatory element. The recombinant vector may be constructed typically as a cloning vector or an expression vector. For recombinant expression vectors, a vector typically available for expressing a foreign protein in plant, animal or microorganism cells may be employed. Various methods well known in the art may be used for the construction of recombinant vectors. For use in hosts, such as prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, the recombinant vector may be constructed appropriately. For example, when a vector is constructed as an expression vector for use in a prokaryotic host, the vector typically includes a strong promoter for transcription (e.g., a pLλ promoter, a CMV promoter, a trp promoter, a lac promoter, a tac promoter, a T7 promoter, etc.), a ribosomal binding side for initiating translation, and transcriptional/translational termination sites. On the other hand, an expression vector for use in a eukaryotic host includes an origin of replication operable in a eukaryotic cell, such as, but not limited to, an f1 origin of replication, an SV40 origin of replication, a pMB1 origin of replication, an adeno origin of replication, an AAV origin of replication, a BBV origin of replication. In addition, the expression vector typically includes a promoter derived from mammalian cells (for example, metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (for example, adenovirus late promoter, vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter, SV40 promoter, cytomegalovirus promoter and tk promoter of HSV), and a polyadenylation sequence as a transcription termination sequence. The recombinant cell may be prepared by introducing the recombinant vector into a suitable host cell. So long as it allows for the sequential cloning and expression of the recombinant vector in a stable manner, any host cell known in the art may be employed. Examples of the prokaryotic host cell available may be at least one selected from the group consisting of E. coli JM109, E. coli BL21, E. coli RR1, E. coli LE392, E. coli B, E. coli X 1776, E. coli W3110, Bacillus spp. such as Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus thuringiensis, and enterobacteriaceae strains such as Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and various Pseudomonas species. Eukaryotic host cells to be transformed may be at least one selected from the group consisting of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, insect cells, plant cells and animal cells including Sp2/0, CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) K1, CHO DG44, PER.C6, W138, BHK, COS-7, 293, HepG2, Huh7, 3T3, RIN, and MDCK, but not be limited thereto. Using a method well known in the art, the polynucleotide or a recombinant vector carrying the polynucleotide may be introduced (incorporated) into a host cell. This transformation is carried out through CaCl2 or electroporation when the host cell is prokaryotic. For eukaryotic host cells, the genetic introduction may be achieved using, but not limited to, microinjection, calcium phosphate precipitation, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection, or particle bombardment. To select a (recombinant vector) transformed host cell, advantage may be taken of the phenotype attributed to a selection marker according to a method known in the art. For example, when the selection marker is a gene resistant to a certain antibiotic, the host cells may be grown in the presence of the antibiotic in a medium to select a transformant of interest. The fusion protein capable of an effective intracellular delivery of granzyme B specific to a cancer cell, and the pharmaceutical composition (anticancer composition) comprising the fusion protein may exhibit a “first-in class” anticancer activity, which is distinguished from pre-existing anticancer agents, and thus, they are expected to be useful as an effective anticancer drug. For example, pharmaceutical composition may have a large effect on almost all types of solid tumors such as lung cancer, breast cancer, etc., and be also expected to have a good effect on metastasis. EXAMPLES Hereafter, the present invention will be described in detail by examples. The following examples are intended merely to illustrate the invention and are not construed to restrict the invention. Example 1 Preparation of a Fusion Protein 1.1. Preparation of GZB-MTS-BAA-M9R-D(E) A fusion protein (amino acid sequence: SEQ ID NO: 1; nucleotide sequence: SEQ ID NO: 2), which comprises, in order from N-terminus to C-terminus, “granzyme B (GZB)-cell penetrating fusion peptide [membrane-translocation sequence (MTS)-basic amino acid (BAA)]-cleavage site (M9R)-targeting moiety [EGFR DARPin (D(E))], was prepared (the first construct in FIG. 1). The amino acid sequence of KKKRK (SEQ ID NO: 15), which is a representative nuclear transfer signal, was used as “BAA”. The nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 was transfected into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cell and expressed, to produce the fusion protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In detail, the polynucleotides were cloned to pET21b vector (Novagen) using the restriction enzymes NdeI (NEB) and XhoI (NEB) to construct recombinant vectors pET21b. These recombinant vectors were introduced into an E. coli strain (BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus-RIPL; Invitrogen). The transfected cells were cultured in LB media. When the O.D. value of absorbance at 600 nm reaches 0.5, 1 mM of IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thio-galactoside) was added to the cell culture, which was further cultured at 18° C. for 16 hours. The obtained cultured cells were crushed by sonication in the presence of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% glycerol and 0.25M NaCl, and centrifuged at 10,000 g, to obtain a supernatant. The obtained supernatant was applied to Ni2+-NTA superflow column (Qiagen) which is equilibrated with the buffer solution. The column was washed with a washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol. and 1 M NaCl) in the amount of 5-fold of the column volume, and then treated with a eluting buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.25 M NaCl and 0.2M imidazole), to elute the fusion protein. The fractions including the fusion protein were collected and salts comprised in the fractions were removed using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter (Milipore), to concentrate and purify the protein. The concentration of the purified protein was measured using BSA as a standard substance. The expression of the fusion protein was observed through SDS-PAGE assay, and the obtained results are shown in FIG. 2.

The cells were inoculated in RPMI medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10%(v/v) FBS in each 96-well plate in the amount of 1×103 cells per each well. In the next day, the cells were treated with each of granzyme B containing fusion proteins ‘IEPDGZB-MTS-BAA-M9R-Dar(EGFR)-MTS-BAA’ (SEQ ID NO: 7), and ‘IEPDGZB-MTS-BAA-M9R-Dar(EGFR)’ (SEQ ID NO: 9), wherein the concentration of each fusion protein was 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 μM, and the amount of each fusion protein treated was 100 μL per a well. The cells were incubated in CO2 incubator for 24 hours under the condition of 37° C., and CO2 5%. After adding 80 μL of CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega) to each well, luminescence was measured using EnVision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer), to obtain the cell viability (%). As a control protein, His6-Dar(EGFR)-linker-TEV was used, which was obtained from cleaved fusion proteins The obtained results are demonstrated in FIG. 3 (HCT116) and FIG. 4 (RKO). As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, in both of HCT116 and RKO cell lines, the fusion proteins exhibit a decrease in cell viability by about 40˜60% at the concentration of 1.6 μM. Such effect on cell viability of a cancer cell line is considerable, and at least about 10-fold superior to that of other tumor suppressor (e.g., p53 n-terminal peptide, p18 protein, etc.) when examined under the same conditions.
