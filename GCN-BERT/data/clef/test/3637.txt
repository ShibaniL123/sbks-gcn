DIBAL-H (24.10 ml, 24.10 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 7-3 (3.55 g, 10.94 mmol) in THF in a dry ice/acetone bath. After completion of addition, the mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. When the raw materials were exhausted which was monitored by TLC, the reaction was quenched by addition of saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution. The mixture was warmed to room temperature, subjected to filtration, washed with ether, then the filtrate was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and directly subjected to the next step. The crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane, then DMP (5.60 g, 13.20 mmol) was added at 0 Â°C, then the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated sodium thiosulfate solution/saturated sodium bicarbonate solution((v/v) = 1/1), and the resultant was extracted with dichloromethane, washed with brine, concentrated, and purified by column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate (v/v) = 50/1) to give product 7-4 (2.928 g, yield 91%).
