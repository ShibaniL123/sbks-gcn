Preparation of compound 38-d.
Compound 38-e (190 mg, 1.28 mmol) was dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide (2 mL). The reaction solution was cooled to 0°C, and N-bromosuccinimide (237 mg, 1.34 mmol) was added in batchesand the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water (40 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL × 3). The combined organic phases were washed successively with water (50 mL × 3) and brine (50 mL),dried over sodium, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a pale brown solid 38-d (261 mg, yield: 90%). This product was used without further purification.
