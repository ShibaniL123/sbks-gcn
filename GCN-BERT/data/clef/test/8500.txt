FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH Not Applicable SEQUENCE LISTING OR PROGRAM Not Applicable BACKGROUND Field of Invention This invention relates to devices and methods for monitoring electromagnetic brain activity. INTRODUCTION This invention relates to mobile wearable devices, systems, and methods for measuring electromagnetic energy from a person's brain. The ability to measure electromagnetic brain activity (such as electroencephalographic EEG activity) with a mobile wearable device allows such measurement while a person is ambulatory. With a mobile and wearable device, a person is free to do their normal activities. This provides useful information which is not possible with EEG monitoring devices which require that the person stay in fixed location (such as a hospital or medical office) with wires sprouting from their head like a modern-day Medusa. The invention disclosed herein is not the first one to tackle this problem. Many talented folks have created designs for mobile wearable devices, systems, and methods for measuring electromagnetic energy from a person's brain. However, this present invention does offer some innovative device designs and application methods which do not appear to be anticipated by the prior art. This present invention offers some wearable EEG monitor designs that are less intrusive than those in the prior art, including discrete integration of a wearable EEG monitor with eyewear. This present invention also offers some innovative applications and methods, including using a wearable EEG monitor to modify food consumption or to control electronically-functional eyewear. The mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor and methods disclosed herein can be very useful. In an example, the mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor and methods disclosed herein can be used to monitor, measure, and modify a person's food consumption. In an example, the mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor and methods disclosed herein can be used to control eyewear with light-transmitting members whose light absorption, light reflection, light refraction, light spectrum transformation, focal direction, focal distance, light polarization, or parallax view are controlled by the wearer's brain activity. In an example, the mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor and methods disclosed herein can be generally used as a Human-to-Computer Interface (HCl). I apologize to the reader for the length of this disclosure. It incorporates the work from four provisional patent applications which all relate to this invention. Hopefully the “Introduction to the Figures” section will help to guide the reader with respect to the structure of the disclosure and to find sections which may be of particular interest. REVIEW AND CATEGORIZATION OF THE RELEVANT ART It can be challenging trying to classify relevant art in this field into discrete categories. However, classification of relevant art into categories, even if imperfect, can be an invaluable tool for reviewing the relevant art. Towards this end, I herein identify 21 categories of relevant art and provide examples of relevant art in each category (including patent or patent application number, inventor, publication date, and title). Some examples of relevant art disclose multiple concepts and thus appear in more than one category. The 21 categories of relevant art which are used for this review are as follows: (1) device like a skull cap with EEG/brainwave sensors; (2) device like a baseball cap with EEG/brainwave sensors; (3) device with [multiple] front-to-back arcuate members and EEG/brainwave sensors; (4) device with [multiple] side-to-side arcuate members and EEG/brainwave sensors; (5) device with multiple cross-crossing arcuate members and EEG/brainwave sensors; (6) device with multiple arms radially-extending from side and EEG/brainwave sensors; (7) device with multiple arms radially-downward from top and EEG/brainwave sensors; (8) device with multiple arms radially-forward from rear and EEG/brainwave sensors; (9) device with multiple arms radially-backward from front and EEG/brainwave sensors; (10) device with circular horizontal loop (e.g. headband style) and EEG/brainwave sensors; (11) device with top semicircular loop (e.g. headphone style) and EEG/brainwave sensors; (12) device with rear semicircular loop and EEG/brainwave sensors; (13) device with frontal semicircular loop and EEG/brainwave sensors; (14) device like eyeglasses or other eyewear with EEG/brainwave sensors; (15) device like a hearing aid or other earwear with EEG/brainwave sensors; (16) device like a breathing mask with EEG/brainwave sensors; (17) specific type of EEG/brainwave sensor; (18) adhesive EEG/brainwave sensors; (19) method for EEG/brainwave analysis; (20) device that actively emits brain-stimulating energy; and (21) miscellaneous. I have labeled this section as a review of the relevant art, instead of a review of the prior art, for two reasons. First, some of the art included in this review has a priority date after the priority date of this disclosure, so I do not wish to call all of this art “prior.” Second, some of the examples in this present disclosure can be classified into one or more of these categories but are nonetheless novel, so I do not wish to imply that all of the art in these categories is “prior”. These caveats notwithstanding, I hope that the reader finds this review and categorization of the relevant art to be useful. 1. Device Like a Skull Cap with EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a sensor-holding member configured like a skull cap. A “skull cap” is defined herein as a wearable cap-like or hat-like member that covers most of the hair-covered portion of a person's head and flexibly conforms to the contours of the head. A skull cap is generally held snugly against the surface of the head by straps and/or elastic bands. Due to the high percentage of the surface area of the top of a person's head which is covered by such a device, such a device can be used to hold a relatively large number of electromagnetic brain activity sensors in a variety of positions across a person's head. Most of the devices in this category are relatively obtrusive and would be awkward to wear outside a medical setting. They are generally not appropriate for wearing during the activities of daily life. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 4,537,198 (Corbett, Aug. 27, 1985, “Electrode Cap”), U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,122 (Johansson, Dec. 30, 1986, “Method and Apparatus for Conducting Brain Function Diagnostic Test”), U.S. Pat.

No. 8,155,736 (Sullivan et al., Apr. 10, 2012, “EEG Control of Devices Using Sensory Evoked Potentials”), and U.S. Pat. No. 8,391,966 (Luo et al., Mar. 5, 2013, “Sensory-Evoked Potential (SEP) Classification/Detection in the Time Domain”). Prior art which appears to be within this category also includes U.S. patent applications: 20070225577 (Mathan, Sep. 27, 2007, “System and Method for Providing Sensor Based Human Factors Protocol Analysis”), 20070225585 (Washbon and Delic, Sep. 27, 2007, “Headset for Electrodes”), 20070238945 (Delic et al., Oct. 11, 2007, “Electrode Headset”), 20070255127 (Mintz et al., Nov. 1, 2007, “Mobile Electroencephalograph Data Collection and Diagnosis System”), 20080275359 (Mintz et al., Nov. 6, 2008, “Mobile in Vivo Brain Scan and Analysis System”), 20100234752 (Sullivan et al., Sep. 16, 2010, “EEG Control of Devices Using Sensory Evoked Potentials”), 20110040202 (Luo et al., Feb. 17, 2011, “Sensory-Evoked Potential (SEP) Classification/Detection in the Time Domain”), 20110298706 (Mann, Dec. 8, 2011, “Brainwave Actuated Apparatus”), and 20120059273 (Meggiolaro et al., Mar. 8, 2012, “Process and Device for Brain Computer Interface”). Prior art which appears to be within this category also includes U.S. patent applications: 20120136273 (Michelson Jr., May 31, 2012, “Apparatus and Method for Monitoring and Analyzing Brainwaves”), 20120220889 (Sullivan et al., Aug. 30, 2012, “EEG Control of Devices Using Sensory Evoked Potentials”), 20120289869 (Tyler, Nov. 15, 2012, “Devices and Methods for Modulating Brain Activity”), 20130211276 (Luo et al., Aug. 15, 2013, “Sensory-Evoked Potential (SEP) Classification/Detection in the Time Domain”), 20130281759 (Hagedorn et al., Oct. 24, 2013, “Transcranial Stimulation Device and Method Based on Electrophysiological Testing”), 20140163408 (Kocher, Jun. 12, 2014, “System for Analyzing Mental and Behavioral Correlations”), and 20140288614 (Hagedorn et al., Sep. 25, 2014, “Electrophysiology Measurement and Training and Remote Databased and Data Analysis Measurement Method and System”). 2. Device Like a Baseball Cap with EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a sensor-holding member configured like a baseball cap. A “baseball cap” is defined herein as a wearable member with a generally-hemispherical portion which fits over the top of a person's head and an attached visor which extends outward from the person's forehead. Sometimes arcuate bands are embedded in the cap in circular-around-the-head, side-to-side-over-the-top, and/or front-to-back-over-the-top configurations. Devices in this category generally do not cover as much of the surface of the head and may not fit as tightly against the surface of the head as skull cap devices. On the plus side, devices in this category are generally less obtrusive than skull cap devices. However, there are still many circumstances and settings wherein wearing a baseball cap is inappropriate. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 4,697,598 (Bernard et al., Oct. 6, 1987, “Evoked Potential Autorefractometry System”), U.S. Pat. No. 4,709,702 (Sherwin, Dec. 1, 1987, “Electroencephalographic Cap”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,161,030 (Levendowski et al., Dec. 12, 2000, “Portable EEG Electrode Locator Headgear”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,381,481 (Levendowski et al., Apr. 30, 2002, “Portable EEG Electrode Locator Headgear”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,513 (Collura et al., Jun. 3, 2003, “EEG Electrode Assemblies”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,640,122 (Manoli et al., Oct. 28, 2003, “EEG Electrode and EEG Electrode Locator Assembly”), and U.S. Pat. No. 7,204,250 (Burton, Apr. 17, 2007, “Bio-Mask”), U.S. Pat. No. 8,281,787 (Burton, Oct. 9, 2012, “Bio-Mask with Integral Sensors”). Prior art which appears to be within this category also includes U.S. patent applications: 20020029005 (Levendowski et al., Mar. 7, 2002, “Portable EEG Electrode Locator Headgear”), 20040073129 (Caldwell et al., Apr. 15, 2004, “EEG System for Time-Scaling Presentations”), 20040163648 (Burton, Aug. 26, 2004, “Bio-Mask with Integral Sensors”), 20100147304 (Burton, Jun. 17, 2010, “Bio-Mask with Integral Sensors”), 20110015503 (Joffe et al., Jan. 20, 2011, “Medical Apparatus for Collecting Patient Electroencephalogram (EEG) Data”), 20110046502 (Pradeep et al., Feb. 24, 2011, “Distributed Neuro-Response Data Collection and Analysis”), 20110046504 (Pradeep et al., Feb. 24, 2011, “Distributed Neuro-Response Data Collection and Analysis”), and 20110270117 (Warwick et al., Nov. 3, 2011, “Remote Continuous Seizure Monitor and Alarm”). 3. Device with [Multiple] Front-to-Back Arcuate Member(s) and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using (multiple) arcing member(s) which span a person's head from front-to-back (or vice versa). Devices in this category can look similar to some types of bicycle helmets with front-to-back arcuate members. In an example, the front-to-back arcing members can converge at the forehead and at the rear of the head. In an example, a device in this category can comprise: a first arcuate member which encircles a person's head: a second arcuate member which loops front-to-back over the top of the head; and third and fourth arcuate members which loop front-to-back over the sides of the head between the first and second members. Devices in this category can hold a relatively large number of electromagnetic brain activity sensors along arcuate front-to-rear lines on a person's head. However, such devices tend to be too obtrusive to wear during the activities of daily life. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 3,998,213 (Price, Dec. 21, 1976, “Self-Adjustable Holder for Automatically Positioning Electroencephalographic Electrodes”), U.S. Pat. No. 8,355,769 (Levendowski et al., Jan. 15, 2013, “System for the Assessment of Sleep Quality in Adults and Children”), U.S. Pat.

No. 8,639,313 (Westbrook et al, Jan. 28, 2014, “System for the Assessment of Sleep Quality in Adults and Children”); and U.S. patent applications 20100125190 (Fadem, May 20, 2010, “Electrode System”), 20100240982 (Westbrook et al., Sep. 23, 2010, “System for the Assessment of Sleep Quality in Adults and Children”), and 20130131464 (Westbrook et al., May 23, 2013, “System for the Assessment of Sleep Quality in Adults and Children”). 4. Device with [Multiple] Side-to-Side Arcuate Member(s) and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using (multiple) arcing member(s) which span a person's head from side to side. In an example, side-to-side arcing members can converge near, or over, the person's ears. In an example, devices in this category can be similar to those in the previous category, except having been rotated 90 degrees so that the arcuate members converge on the sides of the person's head rather than the front and rear of the person's head. Devices in this category can hold a relatively large number of electromagnetic brain activity sensors along arcuate side-to-side lines on a person's head. However, such devices tend to be too obtrusive to wear during the activities of daily life. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,219 (Hobson et al., Jun. 6, 1989, “Electronic Sleep Monitor Headgear”), U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,351 (Mann, Sep. 1, 1998, “Electrode Supporting Head Set”), U.S. Pat.

No. 7,158,822 (Payne Jr., Jan. 2, 2007, “Electrode Holder, Headwear, and Wire Jacket Adapted for Use in Sleep Apnea Testing”), and U.S. Pat. No. 7,885,706 (Ludvig et al., Feb. 8, 2011, “System and Device for Seizure Detection”). Prior art which appears to be within this category also includes U.S. patent applications: 20030018278 (Jordan, Jan. 23, 2003, “Electroencephalogram Acquisition Unit and System”), 20050277821 (Payne, Dec. 15, 2005, “Electrode Holder, Headwear, and Wire Jacket Adapted for Use in Sleep Apnea Testing”), 20070112262 (Payne, May 17, 2007, “Electrode Holder, Headwear, and Wire Jacket Adapted for Use in Sleep Apnea Testing”), 20080082019 (Ludving et al., Apr. 3, 2008, “System and Device for Seizure Detection”), 20090281446 (Ludvig et al., Nov. 12, 2009, “System and Device for Seizure Detection”), 20110015503 (Joffe et al., Jan. 20, 2011, “Medical Apparatus for Collecting Patient Electroencephalogram (EEG) Data”), and 20110270117 (Warwick et al., Nov. 3, 2011, “Remote Continuous Seizure Monitor and Alarm”). 5. Device with Multiple Cross-Crossing Arcuate Members and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using multiple arcing members which span a person's head from front-to-rear and also multiple arcing members which span a person's head from side-to-side. In an example, the front-to-rear arcuate members and the side-to-side arcuate members can form a criss-cross pattern on the person's head. Devices in this category can hold a relatively large number of electromagnetic brain activity sensors on a person's head. However, such devices tend to be too obtrusive to wear during the activities of daily life. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 3,998,213 (Price, Dec. 21, 1976, “Self-Adjustable Holder for Automatically Positioning Electroencephalographic Electrodes”), U.S. Pat. No. 5,293,867 (Oommen, Mar. 15, 1994, “Method and Apparatus for Marking Electrode Locations for Electroencephalographic Procedure”), U.S. Pat. No. 5,479,934 (Imran, Jan. 2, 1996, “EEG Headpiece with Disposable Electrodes and Apparatus and System and Method for Use Therewith”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,488,617 (Katz, Dec. 3, 2002, “Method and Device for Producing a Desired Brain State”), U.S. Pat. No. 8,463,354 (Fadem, Jun. 11, 2013, “Electrode System with Rigid-Flex Circuit”); and U.S. patent applications 20030018278 (Jordan, Jan. 23, 2003, “Electroencephalogram Acquisition Unit and System”), and 20100125190 (Fadem, May 20, 2010, “Electrode System”). 6. Device with Multiple Arms Radially-Extending from Side and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using multiple sensor-holding protrusions, fingers, or arms which extend radially outward from a central position on one side (or from central positions on both sides) of a person's head. In an example, such devices can include bilateral clusters (one on each side of the head) of radially-extending protrusions, fingers, or arms. In an example, radially-extending protrusions, fingers, or arms can curve around the head toward the front, top, and/or rear portions of the head. To use colorful language, some such devices can look like a wearer has one or two starfish (or even octopi) clinging to the sides of their head. Such devices can be less obtrusive than those in the preceding categories (especially when they do not span the forehead or the top of the head), but can still attract attention if worn during the activities of daily life. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 5,954,667 (Finkenzeller et al., Sep. 21, 1999, “Device for Deriving Acoustically Evoked Brain Potentials”), U.S. Pat. No. 8,271,075 (Chuang et al., Sep. 18, 2012, “Audio Headset with Bio-Signal Sensors”), U.S. Pat.

Device with Multiple Arms Radially-Downward from Top and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using multiple sensor-holding protrusions, fingers, or arms which extend radially downward from a position on the top of a person's head. In an example, radially-extending protrusions, fingers, or arms can curve around the head toward the front, sides, and/or rear portions of the head. To use the colorful language from the previous category, now a figurative starfish (or octopus) is clinging to the top of the person's head. Such devices can be less obtrusive than some of those in the preceding categories, but can still attract attention if worn during the activities of daily life. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 6,067,464 (Musha, May 23, 200, “Electrode”), U.S. Pat.

In an example, radially-extending protrusions, fingers, or arms can curve around the head toward the top and sides of the head. To use the colorful language from the previous category, now a figurative starfish (or octopus) is clinging to the back of the person's head. Such devices can be less obtrusive than some of those in the preceding categories, but can still attract attention if worn during the activities of daily life. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 4,770,180 (Schmidt et al., Sep. 13, 1988, “Electroencephalographic Head Set with a Disposable Monitor”), U.S. Pat. No. 4,967,038 (Gevins et al., Oct. 30, 1990, “Dry Electrode Brain Wave Recording System”), U.S. Pat. No. 5,038,782 (Gevins et al., Aug. 13, 1991, “Electrode System for Brain Wave Detection”), and D565735 (Washbon, Apr. 1, 2008, “Electrode Headset”); and U.S. patent applications 20070225585 (Washbon and Delic, Sep. 27, 2007, “Headset for Electrodes”), 20070238945 (Delic et al., Oct. 11, 2007, “Electrode Headset”), 20090105576 (Do et al., Apr. 23, 2009, “Electrode Conductive Element”), 20120029379 (Sivadas, Feb. 2, 2012, “Mind Strength Trainer”), and 20130046206 (Preminger, Feb. 21, 2013, “System and Method for Neurocognitive Training and/or Neuropsychological Assessment”). 9. Device with Multiple Arms Radially-Backward from Front and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using multiple sensor-holding protrusions, fingers, or arms which extend radially backward from a position on the front of a person's head (such as the forehead). In an example, radially-extending protrusions, fingers, or arms can curve around the head toward the top and sides of the head. Such devices can be obtrusive and attract attention, especially if worn to a showing of the movie “Aliens”. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patent application 20020188216 (Kayyali et al., Dec. 12, 2002, “Head Mounted Medical Device”). 10. Device with Circular Horizontal Loop (e.g. Headband Style) and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a sensor-holding member which is configured like a headband, ring, or other generally-circular member which encircles a person's head in (or close to) a horizontal plane when the person is upright. In an example, such a device can span a portion of a person's forehead as it encircles the person's head. Since devices in this category can span a potion of the forehead, such devices can be used with sensors which require contact with (or proximity to) portions of the head which do not have hair. Such devices can be appropriate for wearing while running or doing other types of exercise, but there are still many settings wherein wearing a headband or head-encircling ring is generally not appropriate. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,065 (Devito, Dec. 14, 1999, “Method and Apparatus for Measuring and Analyzing Physiological Signals for Active or Passive Control of Physical and Virtual Spaces and the Contents Therein”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,258 (Karakasoglu et al., Jan. 9, 2001, “Multi-Channel Self-Contained Apparatus and Method for Diagnosis of Sleep Disorders”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,254,536 (Devito, Jul. 3, 2001, “Method and Apparatus for Measuring and Analyzing Physiological Signals for Active or Passive Control of Physical and Virtual Spaces and the Contents Therein”), U.S. Pat.

No. 7,885,706 (Ludvig et al., Feb. 8, 2011, “System and Device for Seizure Detection”). Prior art which appears to be within this category also includes U.S. patent applications: 20010056225 (DeVito, Dec. 27, 2001, “Method and Apparatus for Measuring and Analyzing Physiological Signals for Active or Passive Control of Physical and Virtual Spaces and the Contents Therein”), 20020165462 (Westbrook et al., Nov. 7, 2002, “Sleep Apnea Risk Evaluation”), 20020188216 (Kayyali et al., Dec. 12, 2002, “Head Mounted Medical Device”), 20040267152 (Pineda, Dec. 20, 2004, “Method and System for Predicting and Preventing Seizures”), 20050027207 (Westbrook et al., Feb. 3, 2005, “Sleep Apnea Risk Evaluation”), and 20070249952 (Rubin et al., Oct. 25, 2007, “Systems and Methods for Sleep Monitoring”). Prior art which appears to be within this category also includes U.S. patent applications: 20080082019 (Ludving et al., Apr. 3, 2008, “System and Device for Seizure Detection”), 20090281446 (Ludvig et al., Nov. 12, 2009, “System and Device for Seizure Detection”), 20100099954 (Dickinson et al., Apr. 22, 2010, “Data-Driven Sleep Coaching System”), 20120150545 (Simon, Jun. 14, 2012, “Brain-Computer Interface Test Battery for the Physiological Assessment of Nervous System Health”), 20130060097 (Rubin, Mar. 7, 2013, “Multi-Modal Sleep System”), 20130127708 (Jung et al., May 23, 2013, “Cell-Phone Based Wireless and Mobile Brain-Machine Interface”), and 20130338446 (Van Vugt et al., Dec. 19, 2013, “Sleep Disturbance Monitoring Apparatus”). 11. Device with Top Semicircular Loop (e.g. Headphone Style) and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a (semicircular) arcuate member which looks like a set of headphones, hair band, or tiara. In an example, such a device can loop over the top of a person's head, from one side to the other side. In an example, such a device can loop over the top of a person's head from one ear to the other ear. In example, such a device can not only look like a set of headphones, but can actually be a set of headphones, wherein these headphones also include one or more electromagnetic brain activity sensors. Wearing a set of headphones or a hair band is more common (and thus may attract less attention) than wearing most of the devices discussed in preceding categories, but there are still many settings wherein wearing such a device would attract attention and be inappropriate. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 4,697,598 (Bernard et al., Oct. 6, 1987, “Evoked Potential Autorefractometry System”), U.S. Pat. No. 4,709,702 (Sherwin, Dec. 1, 1987, “Electroencephalographic Cap”), U.S. Pat. No. 5,740,812 (Cowan, Apr. 21, 1998, “Apparatus for and Method of Providing Brainwave Biofeedback”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,154,669 (Hunter et al., Nov. 28, 2000, “Headset for EEG Measurements”), U.S. Pat. No. 6,167,298 (Levin, Dec. 26, 2000, “Devices and Methods for Maintaining an Alert State of Consciousness Through Brain Wave Monitoring”), U.S. Pat. No. 7,689,274 (Mullen et al., Mar. 30, 2010, “Brain-Wave Aware Sleep Management”), U.S. Pat. No. 8,271,075 (Chuang et al., Sep. 18, 2012, “Audio Headset with Bio-Signal Sensors”), and U.S. Pat. No. 8,301,218 (Nguyen et al., Oct. 30, 2012, “Contoured Electrode”), U.S. Pat. No. 8,812,075 (Nguyen et al., Aug. 19, 2014, “Contoured Electrode”). Prior art which appears to be within this category also includes U.S. patent applications: 20120029379 (Sivadas, Feb. 2, 2012, “Mind Strength Trainer”), 20120226127 (Asjes et al., Sep. 6, 2012, “Device for Positioning Electrodes on a User's Scalp”), 20130177883 (Barnehama et al., Jul. 11, 2013, “Systems and Methods for Directing Brain Activity”), and 20130310676 (Jung, Nov. 21, 2013, “EEG Hair Band”). 12. Device with Rear Semicircular Loop and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a (semicircular) arcuate member which loops around the rear portion of a person's head, from one side to the other side. In an example, such a device can loop around the rear portion of a person's head from one ear to the other ear. Such a device can be less obtrusive than many of the devices in preceding categories because it does not span the top of the head or face, but it is not well-suited for use with sensors which require contact with skin without hair. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patent application 20140316230 (Denison et al., Oct. 23, 2014, “Methods and Devices for Brain Activity Monitoring Supporting Mental State Development and Training”). 13. Device with Frontal Semicircular Loop and EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a (semicircular) arcuate member which loops around the front of a person's head, from one side to the other side. In an example, such a device can loop around the front of a person's head from one ear to the other ear. In an example, such a device can span a person's forehead. Such a device can be well-suited for use with sensors which require contact with skin without hair, but can be somewhat obtrusive since it spans a portion of a person's face. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patent application 20080177197 (Lee et al., Jul. 24, 2008, “Method and Apparatus for Quantitatively Evaluating Mental States Based on Brain Wave Signal Processing System”). 14. Device Like Eyeglasses or Other Eyewear with EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a sensor-holding member which looks like a pair of eyeglasses, goggles, or other eyewear. In an example, such a device can span from one ear, to the face, across the face (over the bridge of the nose), and then to the other ear. In example, such a device can not only look like a pair of eyeglasses, but can actually be a pair of eyeglasses, wherein these eyeglasses include one or more electromagnetic brain activity sensors. Some of the art in this category predominantly focuses on the optical aspects of a pair of eyeglasses, with only tangential mention of a possible EEG sensor, but such art is included in this category for the sake of completeness. Wearing a pair of eyeglasses is very common and thus attracts less attention than virtually all of the devices discussed in preceding categories. However, conventional eyeglass frames (especially those with straight side pieces) do not contact a person's temple or forehead. Accordingly, conventional eyeglass frame configurations are not ideally-suited for holding one or more electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with a person's temple and/or forehead. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 7,344,244 (Goodall et al., Mar. 18, 2008, “Adjustable Lens System with Neural-Based Control”), U.S. Pat.

Prior art which appears to be within this category also includes U.S. patent applications: 20130303837 (Berka et al., Nov. 14, 2013, “Systems and Methods for Optimization of Sleep and Post-Sleep Performance”), 20130314303 (Osterhout et al., Nov. 28, 2013, “AR Glasses with User Action Control of and Between Internal and External Applications with Feedback”), 20140023999 (Greder, Jan. 23, 2014, “Detection and Feedback of Information Associated with Executive Function”), 20140267005 (Urbach, Sep. 18, 2014, “Piece for Augmented and Virtual Reality”), 20140267401 (Urbach, Sep. 18, 2014, “Visual Cortex Thought Detector Interface”), 20140347265 (Aimone et al., Nov. 27, 2014, “Wearable Computing Apparatus and Method”), and 20140375545 (Ackerman et al., Dec. 25, 2014, “Adaptive Event Recognition”). 15. Device Like a Hearing Aid or Other Earwear with EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a sensor-holding member which looks like a hearing aid, ear bud, ear set, or other earwear. In an example, such a device can be inserted into an ear or encircle a portion of an ear. Wearing a hearing aid or pair of ear buds is relatively common and thus can attract less attention than many of the devices discussed in preceding categories. However, conventional hearing aid and ear bud designs do not generally contact a person's forehead and thus are not well-suited to hold one or more electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with a person's forehead when that is a desired location for collecting brain activity data. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat. No. 6,694,180 (Boesen, Feb. 17, 2004, “Wireless Biopotential Sensing Device and Method with Capability of Short-Range Radio Frequency Transmission and Reception”), U.S. Pat.

Device Like a Breathing Mask with EEG/Brainwave Sensor(s) Devices in this category hold electromagnetic brain activity sensors in contact with (or proximity to) a person's head using a sensor-holding member which looks like a respiratory mask. In an example, such a mask can be a CPAP mask or other positive airway pressure mask which is generally worn by a person when they are sleeping. In an example, such devices can include members which span a portion of a person's forehead to position sensors there. Such devices can provide useful EEG data during sleep if a person wears a breathing mask while they sleep, but are not well-suited for use during the day. Prior art which appears to be within this category includes U.S. patents: U.S. Pat.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIGS. 1 through 155 show examples of how this invention can be embodied a mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor comprising: a wearable frame worn on a person's head; a plurality of electromagnetic energy sensors which collect data concerning the person's electromagnetic brain activity; and a control unit. However, these examples do not limit the full generalizability of the claims. In an example, the electromagnetic energy sensors can be electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes. In an example, the wearable frame can be substantially circular (or elliptical), spanning the person's forehead and the rear of the person's head. In an example, the wearable frame can loop around the person's head from one ear to the other. This mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor can be used for a variety of purposes. As highlighted by FIGS. 1 through 74, this mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor can be used to monitor, measure, and modify the person's food consumption. As highlighted by FIGS. 75 through 134, this mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor can be used to control eyewear with light-transmitting members whose light absorption, light reflection, light refraction, light spectrum transformation, focal direction, focal distance, light polarization, or parallax view can be controlled by the wearer's brain activity. As highlighted by FIGS. 135 through 155, this mobile wearable electromagnetic brain activity monitor can also comprise eyeglasses and/or other eyewear. FIGS. 1 through 6 provide a conceptual introduction to a method, device, and system to measure and/or modify a person's food consumption using a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor. As shown in FIG. 1, a person's food consumption 101 has an effect on their electromagnetic brain activity 102. Data concerning the person's food consumption 101 and data concerning their electromagnetic brain activity 102 can be collected in a chronologically-linked manner. These two data streams (concerning food consumption and brain activity) can then be jointly analyzed by a brain activity monitor and system 103 in order to identify significant relationships between patterns of food consumption and patterns of brain activity. In an example, this analysis can include a (short) time lag between food consumption and brain activity. In an example, a food-brainwave database can be created, wherein this database links patterns of food consumption 101 with patterns of electromagnetic brain activity 102. FIG. 1 shows the operation of a method for measuring and/or modifying food consumption during a first time period (which can be called a “calibration” period or an “association-creating” period) in which data concerning food consumption 101 and data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 102 are independently collected and jointly analyzed in order to identify significant associations between them. In an example, during a first (calibration) time period, data concerning food consumption can be manually entered via a human-to-computer interface which is part of a wearable EEG monitor. In an example, during a first (calibration) time period, data concerning food consumption can be manually entered into a physically-separate device or a remote computer as part of an overall system of wirelessly-linked devices. FIG. 2 shows the operation of this method during a second time period (after calibration) during which the previously-identified associations are used to estimate a person's food consumption based on their brain activity. In particular, during the second time period (shown in FIG. 2), the person's electromagnetic brain activity 102 is monitored and data concerning their brain activity is collected. Combining this brain activity data 102 with the associations between food consumption and brain activity which were identified in the first (calibration) period, the person's food consumption 101 is estimated from the person's brain activity 102. In an example, data concerning food consumption and brain activity can be analyzed within a data processor which is part of a wearable EEG monitor. In an example, data concerning food consumption and brain activity can be wirelessly transmitted to a physically-separate device or a remote computer and analyzed in that separate device or remote computer as part of an overall system of wirelessly-linked devices. In an example, a food-brainwave database which links food consumption patterns to brain activity patterns can be created de novo for a specific person. In an example, a previously-created food-brainwave database, which links food consumption patterns to brain activity patterns, can be used and a first (calibration) period can be shortened or skipped entirely. In an example, a general population food-brainwave database which links food consumption patterns to brain activity patterns can be created for a general population and then tailored, customized, or adapted for use for a specific person. In an example, a general population food-brainwave database can be tailored, customized, or adapted for use for a specific person based on demographic, physiologic, behavioral, health status, geographic and/or environmental parameters for that person. In an example, a general population food-brainwave database can be tailored, customized, or adapted for use for a specific person based on the person's baseline brainwave information. In an example, such tailoring, customization, or adaptation can include Bayesian statistical methods, an artificial neural network, evolving algorithms, and/or machine learning. In an example, food consumption can comprise total consumption of food of any type, including beverages as well as solid food. In an example, tracking and estimation of food consumption can be much more detailed and specific. In an example, food consumption can comprise consumption of specific types and amounts of foods, ingredients, and/or nutrients. In an example, a type of food, ingredient, or nutrient can be selected from the group consisting of: a specific type of carbohydrate, a class of carbohydrates, or all carbohydrates; a specific type of sugar, a class of sugars, or all sugars; a specific type of fat, a class of fats, or all fats; a specific type of cholesterol, a class of cholesterols, or all cholesterols; a specific type of protein, a class of proteins, or all proteins; a specific type of fiber, a class of fiber, or all fiber; a specific sodium compound, a class of sodium compounds, and all sodium compounds; high-carbohydrate food, high-sugar food, high-fat food, fried food, high-cholesterol food, high-protein food, high-fiber food, and high-sodium food. In an example, food consumption can be directly measured during a first (calibration) time period (in FIG. 1) by active entry of food information by a person via a human-to-computer interface such as a touchscreen, speech recognition interface, gesture recognition interface, EMG recognition interface, eye movement recognition interface, keypad, buttons, or knobs. In an example, a person can enter information concerning food that they eat via a software application on a portable electronic device using a menu-driven interface with pictures and descriptions of common foods and portions. In an example, food consumption can be directly measured during a first (calibration) time period in FIG. 1 by automatic tracking of food consumption via a wearable or handheld imaging device. In an example, a person can take pictures of food from different angles for 3D modeling of food volume as well as automatic food identification. In an example, electronically-functional eyewear with imaging capability can automatically track and identify food consumption using pattern recognition and/or gesture recognition. In an example, a person can use a spectroscopic food probe, scanner, or utensil to also collect information concerning the chemical composition of food. In an example, food consumption can also be independently measured by an intraoral chemical-composition sensor. As shown in FIG. 2, this invention can be embodied in a method that is able to not only track a person's food consumption, but also to help the person to modify their food consumption to improve their nutrition, weight management, and overall health. In addition to estimating the person's food consumption based on their brain activity, a brain activity monitor and system 103 can also provide feedback to the person in order to prompt the person to modify their food consumption. In an example, a brain activity monitor and system 103 can provide feedback to a person via a visual, auditory, or tactile computer-to-human interface in order to inform the person of their estimated food consumption and/or to prompt the person to modify their food consumption. In an example, this feedback can be based on the person's cumulative amount of food consumption. In an example, this feedback can be based on the person's consumption of a specific type or amount of food, ingredient, or nutrient. In an example, this feedback can be conveyed through a physically-separate device such as a smart phone, smart watch, smart wrist band, electronically-functional eyewear and/or contact lenses, wearable camera, other wearable device, tablet, desktop, or other remote computer. In an example, feedback can be conveyed to a person in the form of a written or spoken message that is delivered through a computer-to-human interface. In an example, feedback can be a text message. In an example, an interface for providing feedback can be part of a wearable EEG monitor itself. In an example, feedback can be delivered via a smart watch, a smart phone, or electronically-functional eyewear. In an example, feedback can be in the form of a visual, auditory, or tactile stimulus. In an example, feedback can be a gentle vibration or quiet tone. In an example, feedback can convey information concerning what type and/or amount of food consumption triggered the feedback and provide suggestions concerning how to modify food consumption to ensure proper nutrition. In an example, feedback can be triggered by a person's consumption of selected types or amounts of foods, nutrients, and/or ingredients as estimated by brain activity data collected by a wearable EEG monitor. In an example, this feedback can be triggered by the person's cumulative consumption of food and/or calories during a selected period of time. In an example, this feedback can encourage the person to modify their food consumption patterns to achieve better nutrition, proper energy balance, and/or predefined health goals. In an example, this feedback can be part of an overall system for proper nutrition, weight management, and improved health. In an example, electromagnetic brain activity can be measured by a plurality of electrodes in a mobile electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor which the person wears on their head in an ongoing manner. In an example, electrodes used can be dry electrodes. In an example, a person's brain activity can be measured from one or multiple selected recording sites using a mobile wearable EEG monitor. In an example, measurement of brain activity can comprise measuring electromagnetic data concerning impedance, voltage difference, and/or energy transfer between two sites on a person's head—a selected recording site and a reference site. In an example, electromagnetic brain activity data can be measured by an electrode or other brain activity sensor at a selected recording place. In an example, electromagnetic brain activity data from a selected recording place (relative to a reference place) can be called a “channel.” In an example, electromagnetic brain activity data from multiple recording places can be called a “montage.” In various examples, one or multiple recording places can be selected from the group of EEG placement sites consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In an example, one or more reference places can be selected from the group of sites consisting of A1 and A2. In an example, brain activity data can be recorded at a rate in the range of 100 to 300 samples per second. In an example, there can be different regions of brain activity for neural processing of the color, shape, texture, odor, taste, and feel of food. In an example, identification of food types and estimates of food quantity can be based on multivariate analysis of the activities of different brain regions associated with visual processing, image recognition, olfactory processing, taste processing, texture processing, and sensorymotor processing (such as chewing and swallowing). In an example, there can be a progressive or phased effect of food consumption on brain activity. In an example, a first phase can occur when a person sees and smells food prior to eating it. In an example, a second phase can occur as a person tastes, smells, and feels food as they eat it. In an example, a third phase can occur as food is digested within a person's gastrointestinal tract and nutrients from food enter the person's blood stream. In an example, statistical analysis of brain activity can comprise analysis of the separate, sequential, or cumulative effects of these three phases of food consumption. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a mobile wearable EEG monitor. A person can wear a mobile wearable EEG monitor on an ongoing and ambulatory basis. This EEG monitor can measure their brain activity, via one or more EM data channels, during different activities including eating. In an example, this invention can also comprise the use of one or more statistical methods to identify associations between: (a) the occurrence of hunger, satiation, a pleasant taste or odor in general, an unpleasant taste or odor in general, a specific taste, a specific odor, food consumption in general, consumption of a specific type of food, consumption of a specific type of nutrient, or consumption of a specific type of ingredient; and (b) the occurrence of a specific pattern of brain activity which is measured from one or more data channels on a mobile wearable EEG monitor. In an example, these associations can be used to create a food-brainwave database (or library) which links consumption of specific types and/or amounts of foods, nutrients, or ingredients with particular patterns of brain activity. In an example, this database of links between types of food consumption and types of brain activity can be generally applicable for all people. In an example, this database of links between types of food consumption and types of brain activity can be specifically-developed and/or customized for a particular person. In an example, a first database can link consumption of specific types and amounts of food to specific patterns of brain activity and a second database can link specific types and amounts of food to specific types and amounts of nutrients. In an example, sequential use of both databases can provide information on the types and amounts of nutrients which a person consumes based on information concerning their brain activity. In an alternative example, a single database can directly link specific patterns of brain activity and specific types and amounts of nutrients. In an example, these identified associations between food consumption and brain activity can be used to track a person's consumption of foods, nutrients, and/or ingredients. In an example, these associations between food consumption and brain activity can be used to provide feedback to the person concerning their consumption of foods, nutrients, and/or ingredients. In an example, these associations between food consumption and brain activity can be used to provide feedback to the person concerning their brain activity related to consumption of foods, nutrients, and/or ingredients. In an example, these associations between food consumption and brain activity can be used to modify the person's consumption of foods, nutrients, and/or ingredients. In an example, brain activity can be associated with food consumption during a first (calibration and/or database-creation) time period. In an example, during this calibration period, a database or data library can be created in which statistical models and parameters for linking brain activity to food consumption are estimated. These statistical models and parameters can be estimated for a general population or can be specific to a particular person. In an example, statistical models or parameters can be first estimated for the general population and then customized or adapted to a specific person, optionally through the use of Bayesian statistical methods. In an example, a general database, model, or model parameter can be customized, adjusted, modified, tailored, or adapted for a specific person. In an example, application of a database, model, or model parameter can control for variables selected from the group consisting of: a person's age, a person's gender, a person's health status, the time of day, level of recent physical activity, geographic location, and environmental variables. In an example, a database, model, and model parameters can be estimated de novo for a specific person. During a calibration period, data concerning food consumption and data concerning brain activity can be collected in a chronologically-linked manner. Data from these two sources can then be jointly analyzed using statistical methods in order to identify significant associations between specific patterns of food consumption and specific patterns of brain activity. In an example, these data streams can be analyzed within the data processor of a wearable EEG monitor. In an example, these data streams can be transmitted wirelessly to a separate device or remote location wherein the data is analyzed. In an example, a calibration or database-creation process can be an iterative one—employing Bayesian statistics, adaptive algorithms, and/or an artificial neural network. In an example, a general database or statistical method that links food consumption and brain activity patterns can be created for the general population and then customized for a specific person. In an example, a database or statistical method that links food consumption and brain activity patterns can be created de novo for a specific person. In an example, estimation of models and parameters for associating specific patterns of brain activity with specific types of food consumption can be an iterative or evolving process employing machine learning and/or an artificial neural network. In an example, a database can link consumption of specific foods, ingredients, or nutrients with specific patterns of EM brain activity. In an example, this linkage can be dependent on, or control for, a variety of control parameters including: person's age and gender, time of day, activity level, location, etc. In an example, such a database can include brainwave patterns associated with common foods, portion sizes which are commonly associated with these foods, ingredients which are commonly associated with these foods, nutrients which are commonly associated with these foods, and calories which are commonly associated with these foods. In an example, information concerning food consumption can be collected by a means other than collection of information on brain activity during a first (calibration and/or database-creation) period. In an example, during a calibration and/or database-creation period, information concerning food consumption can be manually entered and/or collected by the person wearing the EEG monitor. In an example, during a calibration and/or database-creation period, information concerning food consumption can be automatically collected by a mechanism and/or device other than measurement of brain activity by the wearable EEG monitor. In an example, during a calibration and/or database creation period, information concerning food consumption can be collected by an interactive combination of automatic data collection and manual data entry. In an example, during a first (calibration) time period, a person can manually enter information concerning food consumption via a hand-held mobile device such as a smart phone, electronic pad, or electronic tablet. In an example, a person can manually enter information concerning food consumption via a wearable device such as a smart watch, smart bracelet, or electronically-functional eyewear. In an example, a person can manually enter information concerning food consumption via a laptop, desktop, or other relatively fixed-location computer. In an example, a person can manually enter information concerning food consumption via a touchscreen, keyboard, keypad, touch buttons, or gesture recognition interface. In an example, food consumption information can be entered and/or collected via an eye movement detector or EMG sensor. In an example, software for entry of food consumption information can include pictures and descriptions of common food items. In an example, a person can manually enter information concerning food consumption via a speech recognition interface. In an example, during a first (calibration) time period, a person can actively collect information concerning food consumption by taking one or more pictures of food. In an example, such picture taking can be done with a handheld device which must be manually aimed toward food and manually triggered to take pictures. In an example, images of food can be automatically collected by an automatic imaging device which the person wears. In an example, images of food consumed can be automatically collected via a wearable camera or by eyewear with automatic imaging functionality. In an example, manually or automatically obtained pictures of food from different angles can be analyzed using three-dimensional modeling to estimate the volume of food consumed. In an example, a camera or other imaging device can take simultaneous pictures of food from different angles. In an example, a camera or other imaging device can take sequential pictures of food from different angles due to movement of the device, movement of the food, or both such movements. In an example, food consumption can be estimated by a wearable camera or electronically-functional eyewear based on gesture recognition as the person's hands interact with food and their mouth. In an example, food type can be identified from a picture of food using one or more methods selected from the group consisting of: analysis of food color, shape, and texture; packaging logo and/or label recognition or identification; and bar code recognition or identification. In an example, information concerning food consumed can be collected by scanning a bar code or other digital code associated with a food product sold in a store or menu item in a restaurant. In an example, location as detected by a GPS unit can be a factor in food identification, especially if the location is a restaurant that serves standardized servings and/or sells standardized packages of food. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a device for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; and a GPS unit. In an example, a control unit can comprise a data processor.

In an example, information concerning the types and amounts of food consumed can be collected from a smart food utensil, food probe, or food scanner that analyses the composition and volume of food consumed. In an example, food composition can be automatically analyzed via spectroscopy. In an example, information concerning specific types and amounts of food consumed can be collected during a calibration and/or database-creation period and this information can then be automatically linked to specific types and amounts of nutrients and/or ingredients using a database of common foods, their ingredients, and their nutritional composition. In an example, a hand-held or wearable spectroscopy device can be used to provide independent data concerning the types and amounts of nutrients and/or ingredients in specific types and amounts of food. In an example, a spectroscopy device can analyze the spectrum of light reflected from the surface of food or passing through a layer of food. In an example, electromagnetic data concerning brain activity can be filtered to remove artifacts before the application of primary statistical methods. In an example, electromagnetic signals from eye blinks, eye flutters, or other eye movements can be removed prior to the application of primary statistical methods. In an example, a notch filter can be used as well to remove 60 Hz artifacts caused by AC electrical lines. In various examples, one or more data filters can be selected from the group consisting of: a high-pass filter, a band-pass filter, a loss-pass filter, an electromyographic activity filter, a 0.5-1 Hz filter, and a 35-70 Hz filter. In an example, a specific pattern of brain activity can follow a specific pattern of food consumption after a time lag. In an example, this time lag can be in the range of 20-100 milliseconds. In an example, a specific pattern of brain activity associated with a specific pattern of food consumption can be analyzed as an Event Related Potential (ERP). In an example, a specific pattern of food consumption can be associated with a transient pattern of brain activity which does not repeat over time. In an example, a specific pattern of food consumption can be associated with a rhythmic pattern of brain activity which does repeat over time. In an example, statistical methods used to associate specific brainwave patterns with the consumption of specific types and/or amounts of food, ingredients, or nutrients can include analysis of wave frequency, wave frequency band, wave amplitude, wave phase, and wave form or morphology. In an example, wave form or morphology can be identified from the group consisting of: simple sinusoidal wave, composite sinusoidal wave, simple saw-tooth wave, composite saw-tooth wave, biphasic wave, tri-phasic wave, and spike.

As shown in FIG. 2, after a first (calibration) time period is completed, this invention can be used to track a person's food consumption by measuring and analyzing their brain activity using a wearable EEG monitor. In an example, food consumption can be automatically detected by measurement and analysis of brain activity. In an example, consumption of specific types of foods, ingredients, and nutrients can be automatically monitored, detected, and measured by a wearable EEG monitor using selected statistical methods, model parameters, and/or databases linking food consumption patterns to brain activity patterns. In an example, such a database can include brainwave patterns associated with common foods, portion sizes which are commonly associated with these foods, ingredients which are commonly associated with those foods, nutrients which are commonly associated with these foods, and calories which are commonly associated with these foods. In an example, automatic monitoring of food consumption based on brain activity can make use of statistical methods, model parameters, and/or databases which were identified and created during an earlier calibration period. In an example, a person's consumption of selected foods, ingredients, and/or nutrients can also be modified through feedback based on these statistical methods, model parameters, and/or databases. In an example, feedback can help a person to eat less unhealthy food and/or eat more healthy food. In an example, feedback can help a person to better balance their caloric intake and caloric expenditure to better manage their weight. In an example, automatic monitoring and measurement of food consumption via a wearable EEG monitor can be supplemented or refined by other methods of monitoring and measuring food consumption.

FIGS. 3 and 4 provide a conceptual introduction to how this invention can be embodied in a method, device, or system to measure and/or modify a person's food consumption using a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) monitor wherein modification of food consumed is achieved by self-modification of brain activity by the person wearing the monitor. In this example, the operation of a brain activity monitor and system during a first (calibration) time period shown in FIG. 3 is the same as was shown in FIG. 1. However, the type of feedback that is used to modify food consumption in FIG. 4 is different than the type of feedback that was used to modify food consumption in FIG. 2. In the example in FIG. 4, the person wearing the EEG monitor receives feedback concerning their brain activity. In an example, this feedback can be biofeedback. In an example, a visual, auditory, or tactile computer interface provides the person with feedback concerning their brain activity patterns and helps the person to self-modify these brain activity patterns as a means of modifying their food consumption. In an example, the feedback provided in FIG. 4 helps the person to self-modify their brain activity patterns in order to self-modify their desire for selected types or amounts of food. In the example shown in FIG. 4, modification of food consumption is mediated through self-modification of a person's brain activity. In an example, interactive feedback concerning brain activity patterns can help a person to modify their brain activity patterns into brain activity patterns that are associated with feelings of satiety. In an example, self-modification of brain activity patterns into patterns that are associated with feelings of satiety can help a person to reduce their food consumption. In an example, interactive feedback concerning brain activity patterns can help a person to modify their brain activity patterns into brain activity patterns that are associated with consumption of food that they like. In an example, self-modification of brain activity patterns into patterns that are associated with consumption of food that they like can help a person to increase their consumption of healthy food that they normally dislike. In an example, such feedback can also be useful in helping a person to exercise self-control with respect to addictive behavior. In an example, a computer interface which helps a person to self-modify their brain activity can comprise an interactive graphical display on a computer screen. In an example, this interactive graphical display can change from a first display configuration to a second display configuration as the person's brain activity changes from a first EM pattern to a second EM pattern. In an example, the second EM pattern of brain activity can be associated with a feeling of satiety. In an example, this second pattern of brain activity can be associated with consumption of a food that the person likes. In an example, the person can change their brain activity (to modify their food consumption) by concentrating on shifting the interactive graphic display from a first display configuration to a second display configuration. In an example, an interactive graphical display can be a changing geometric pattern, color pattern, moving bar, or moving dial. In an example, an interactive graphical display can be a face with a changing expression. In an example, a computer interface which helps a person to self-modify their brain activity can comprise an interactive audio signal. In an example, this interactive audio signal can change from a first sound pattern to a second sound pattern as the person's brain activity changes from a first EM pattern to a second EM pattern. In an example, the second EM pattern of brain activity can be associated with a feeling of satiety. In an example, this second pattern of brain activity can be associated with consumption of a food that the person likes. In an example, the person can change their brain activity (to modify their food consumption) by concentrating on shifting the interactive audio signal from a first sound pattern to a second sound pattern. In an example, an interactive audio signal can be a changing tone or a changing blend of tones. In an example, an interactive audio signal can be music with changing parameters.

In an example, this invention can be embodied in a method for modifying a person's food consumption comprising: (a) receiving data concerning a person's food consumption from a first time period: wherein this data is selected from the group consisting of: data communicated by the person via a touch screen interface, speech recognition interface, motion recognition interface, gesture recognition interface, eye movement interface, EMG recognition interface, or keyboard, keypad, or buttons, data from analysis of food images, food packaging, or food labels, data from a spectroscopic food probe, data from a smart food utensil, data from one or more wearable cameras, data from one or more motion sensors, data from one or more electromagnetic sensors in electromagnetic communication with the person's mouth, nose, tongue, esophagus, stomach, intestine or in electromagnetic communication with a nerve which innervates the person's mouth, nose, tongue, esophagus, stomach, or intestine, data from one or more optical sensors in optical communication with the person's mouth, nose, tongue, esophagus, stomach, intestine, or circulatory system, and data from one or more chemical sensors in fluid communication with the person's mouth, nose, tongue, esophagus, stomach, intestine, or circulatory system; and wherein food consumption can comprise consumption of food overall or consumption of one or more selected amounts and/or types of foods, ingredients, or nutrients; (b) receiving data concerning the person's electromagnetic brain activity from the first time period from one or more electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be less than one inch from the surface of the person's head; (c) creating a food-brainwave database, wherein this database links patterns of food consumption to patterns of electromagnetic brain activity, by analyzing data concerning the person's food consumption and data concerning the person's electromagnetic brain activity from the first time period; (d) receiving data concerning the person's electromagnetic brain activity from a second time period from one or more electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be less than one inch from the surface of the person's head; and (e) providing feedback to the person concerning their electromagnetic brain activity from the second time period in order to prompt the person to modify their food consumption by self-modifying their electromagnetic brain activity. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a method for modifying a person's food consumption comprising: (a) receiving data concerning a person's electromagnetic brain activity from a selected time period from one or more electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be less than one inch from the surface of the person's head; and (b) providing feedback to the person concerning their electromagnetic brain activity from the selected time period in order to prompt the person to modify their food consumption by self-modifying their electromagnetic brain activity. FIGS. 5 and 6 show an example of how this invention can be embodied in a method, device, or system to measure and/or modify a person's food consumption that uses both: (a) direct visual, auditory, and/or tactile feedback which prompts the person to modify their food consumption; and (b) interactive indirect feedback concerning the person's electromagnetic brain activity which prompts the person to self-modify their brain activity in order to modify their food consumption. In this example, FIG. 5 is the same as FIG. 1, but FIG. 6 includes both the direct feedback that was introduced in FIG. 2 and the indirect biofeedback that was introduced in FIG. 4. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 6, an embodiment of this invention can provide feedback concerning brain activity to a person wearing a mobile EEG monitor and this feedback can help the person to modify their food consumption. In an example, such feedback can enable the person to modify their brain activity which, in turn, modifies their food consumption. In an example, such feedback can be triggered by the person's consumption of selected types or amounts of foods, nutrients, and/or ingredients as measured by brain activity data collected by the mobile EEG monitor. This tracking of food consumption based on brain activity patterns can be based on previously-identified associations between specific types of food consumption and specific patterns of brain activity. In an alternative example, this feedback can be self-initiated by the person in a proactive manner when the person craves an amount or type of food which is unhealthy to consume. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 6, modification of food consumption can be caused by biofeedback and self-modification of brain activity. In an example, this invention can provide a computer-user interface which conveys information concerning brain activity patterns to a person wearing a mobile EEG monitor and helps the person to self-modify these brain activity patterns in order to change their desire for, and consumption of, a selected type or amount of food. In an example, a computer-user interface can help the person to self-modify their brain activity pattern toward a pattern that has been shown to be associated with satiety. In an example, this computer-user interface can provide interactive visual, auditory, and/or tactile cues to help the person self-modify their brain activity pattern. In an example, this computer-user interface can provide interactive graphical, avatar, or musical cues to help the person self-modify their brain activity. In an example, this computer-user interface can help the person to modify their brain activity pattern from a first pattern that is associated with hunger to a second pattern that is associated with satiety. In an example, self-modification of brain activity toward satiety can help the person to limit overeating. In an example, a computer-user interface can help a person to self-modify their brain activity pattern toward a pattern that has been shown to be associated with a good-tasting food. In an example, this computer-user interface can employ visual, auditory, and/or tactile cues to help the person self-modify their brain activity pattern toward an activity pattern that is associated with good-tasting food. In an example, this computer-user interface can help the person to modify their brain activity pattern from a first pattern that is associated with a first type or amount of food to a second pattern that is associated with a second type or amount of food. In an example, self-modification of brain activity toward a pattern that is associated with consuming a less-healthy (but more-appealing) type of food can help the person to instead consume a more-healthy (but less-appealing) type of food. In an example, with practice and help from this invention, a person may be able to train their brain to respond more favorably to healthy food and less favorably to unhealthy food. In an example, this invention can help a person to exercise “mind over platter”. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a device (or in a system of wirelessly-linked devices) which comprises hardware for the operation of the above-discussed methods of food consumption measurement and modification. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a device or system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption which includes a mobile wearable EEG monitor.

In an example, a power source for a wearable EEG monitor can be selected from the group consisting of: power from a power source that is internal to the device during regular operation (such as an internal battery, capacitor, energy-storing microchip, or wound coil or spring); power that is obtained, harvested, or transduced from a power source other than the person's body that is external to the device (such as a rechargeable battery, electromagnetic inductance from external source, solar energy, indoor lighting energy, wired connection to an external power source, ambient or localized radiofrequency energy, or ambient thermal energy); and power that is obtained, harvested, or transduced from the person's body (such as kinetic or mechanical energy from body motion, electromagnetic energy from the person's body, blood flow or other internal fluid flow, glucose metabolism, or thermal energy from the person's body. In an example, a wearable EEG monitor can be in data communication with a separate electronic device comprising one or more components selected from the group consisting of: one or more accelerometers; one or more cameras; a computer-to-human interface such as a display screen, one or more lights, one or more speakers, and/or one or more tactile actuators; a human-to-computer interface such as a touch screen, one or more touch-activated buttons, microphone and speech-recognition capability, and/or gesture recognition capability; a data memory component; a data processor; a GPS component; a power source and/or power-transducing component; and a wireless data transmission and data reception component. In an example the combination of a wearable EEG monitor and a separate electronic device can together comprise a system for using brain activity to measure and modify food consumption. In an example, the operation of this invention can occur within a self-contained wearable EEG monitor. In an example, the operation of this invention can occur within a distributed system of which a wearable device, such as a mobile wearable EEG monitor, is one component, and wherein the mobile wearable EEG monitor is in (wireless) communication with a remote computing device which is part of the overall system for using brain activity to measure and modify food consumption. In an example, all aspects of human-to-computer interaction and computer-to-human interaction can occur via one or more interfaces which are physical components of a wearable EEG monitor. In an example, some or all aspects of human-to-computer interaction and/or computer-to-human interaction can occur via one or more interfaces in one or more physically-separate remote devices with which a wearable EEG monitor is in wireless data communication. In an example, a person can use a physically-separate device to enter information concerning food consumption during a calibration period. In an example, a person can use a physically-separate device to enter information concerning food consumption when promoted by analysis of brain activity data collected by the wearable EEG monitor. In an example, a separate computing device with which a wearable EEG monitor communicates can also be worn by the person. In an example, the EEG monitor together with a separate computing device can comprises a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption. In an example, a separate computing device with which an EEG monitor is in data communication can worn on a person's wrist, hand, finger, arm, waist, torso, legs, neck, ear(s), and/or head. In an example, a separate computing device with which an EEG monitor is in data communication can be attached to a person's clothing by a means selected from the group consisting of: band, strap, clip, clamp, snap, pin, hook and eye fastener, magnet, and adhesive. In various example, a separate wearable computing device with which a wearable EEG monitor is in data communication can be selected from the group consisting of: a wristwatch, smart watch, fitness watch, watch phone, bracelet phone, smart bracelet, fitness bracelet, smart wrist band, electronically-functional wrist band, other wrist-worn electronic device, or smart armband; smart glasses, smart eyewear, augmented reality eyewear, virtual reality eyewear, an electronically-functional visor, electronically-functional contact lens, or other electronically-functional eyewear; a smart button, electronically-functional button, pin, brooch, pendant, beads, neck chain, necklace, dog tags, locket, or medallion; a smart finger ring, electronically-functional finger ring, electronically-functional earring, nose ring, or ear bud or clip; a wearable camera; an article of smart clothing, an electronically-functional shirt, electronically-functional pants, or a smart belt; electronically-functional headband, hair pin, headphones, or ear phones; electronically-functional dental appliance, dental attachment, palatal vault attachment, or other electronically-functional intraoral device. In an example, a separate computing device with which the EEG monitor communicates can also be held and/or carried by the person. In an example, a separate hand-held or carried computing device with which an EEG monitor is in data communication can be selected from the group consisting of: smart phone, mobile phone, or cellular phone; PDA; electronic tablet; electronic pad; smart food utensil; and other electronically-functional handheld device. In an example, a separate computing device with which the EEG monitor communicates can in a relatively-fixed remote location. In an example, a separate computing device with which an EEG monitor is in data communication can be selected from the group consisting of: laptop computer, desktop computer, internet terminal, smart appliance, or other fixed-location electronic communication device. In an example, the locations of electrodes (or other brain activity sensors) on a wearable EEG monitor can be identified according to the International 10-20 System and/or the Modified Combinatorial Nomenclature (MCN).

Starting with FIG. 7, we now transition to discussing some specific-hardware device and system embodiments of this invention. FIG. 7 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a wearable EEG monitor (702) for measuring and/or modifying a person's (701) food consumption comprising a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703) which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of the person's head and a control unit (704). In an example, control unit 704 can comprise a mobile power source and/or power transducer (wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources), a data processor; and a data transmitter. FIG. 7 shows a left-side view of a person 701 wearing EEG monitor 702 with a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703) and control unit 704. In this example, the electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703) are located at the following EEG electrode sites: frontal polar sites Fp1 and Fp2; frontal sites F7, F3, Fz, F4 and F8; temporal sites T3 (T7 in the MCN), T4 (T8 in the MCN), T5 (P7 in the MCN) and T6 (P8 in the MCN); central sites C3, C4 and Cz; parietal sites P3, P4 and Pz; and occipital sites O1 and O2; and earlobe reference sites A1 (705) and A2. FIG. 7 shows only the left side and top line of the person's head. In this example, the configuration of electrodes or other brain activity sensors is assumed to be symmetric with respect to the left and right sides of the person's head. FIG. 7 shows electrodes or other brain activity sensors at the following left-side and top sites: frontal polar site Fp1; frontal sites F7, F3 and Fz; temporal sites T3 and T5; central sites C3 and Cz; parietal sites P3 and Pz; and occipital site O1. Since symmetry is assumed, electrodes or other brain activity sensors are also assumed to be at the following right-side sites which are not shown here: frontal polar site Fp2; frontal sites F4 and F8; temporal sites T4 and T6; central site C4; parietal site P4; and occipital site O2. FIG. 7 also shows optional earlobe reference site A1 (705). Symmetric reference sites include earlobe site A1 on the left side and earlobe site A2 (not shown) on the right side. In this example, the electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703) are visible from an external side view of the EEG monitor. In an example, these sensors might not be visible from an external side perspective. They may only be visible on the inside of the bands. In an example, electrodes or other brain activity may be imbedded within the bands and may not be visible from any view. In FIG. 7, wearable EEG monitor (702) is further comprised of five arcuate bands (or straps). In this example, each of these five bands arcs around an approximately-hemispherical portion of the person's head. In this example, these five bands converge at a pivoting location near the person's ear. In an example, a wearable EEG monitor can comprise three or four bands (or straps), each of which arcs around an approximately-hemispherical portion of the person's head. In various examples, these bands can be rigid, semi-rigid, flexible, or elastic. In this example, a bottom frontal band and a bottom posterior band together comprise a slightly-curved, roughly-circular loop that goes around the person's head. In this example, this circular loop is tilted at an acute angle with respect to the horizontal plane (when the person's head is upright), wherein this acute angle is in the range of 20 to 60 degrees. In an example, the relative locations of a subset of bands can adjusted to customize the locations of electrodes or other brain activity sensors to the anatomy of a specific person. In an example, a subset of arcuate bands can be radially-adjusted by pivoting them around the point of band convergence. In the example shown in FIG. 7, the upper three bands can be radially-adjusted. Potential adjustment is indicated in FIG. 7 by three curved dotted-line arrows, at the distal arcs of these bands, each of which spans a small portion of the perimeter of the top of the person's head. In an example, a smaller or larger subset of bands can be radially-adjustable by pivoting. In an example, all five bands can be radially-adjustable by pivoting. In an example, radial-adjustment of bands can be done until the pattern of brain activity which is measured by the electrodes or other brain activity sensors best matches a standard or otherwise-expected pattern under selected conditions. In an example, such adjustment can be done in an iterative manner during a fitting period. In an example, radial-adjustment of one or more bands can be done by hand. In an example, radial-adjustment or one or more bands can be done automatically by one or more actuators. In an example, control unit 704 can include one or more actuators. In an example, individual electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703) can have fixed locations along the lengths of the bands. In an example, the location of one or more individual electrodes or other brain activity sensors can be moved along the lengths of bands, such as by movement along a track which spans a portion of the length of a band. In an example, this movement can be done by hand. In an example, this movement can be done automatically by one or more actuators. In example, this movement can help to customize the location of electrodes or other brain activity sensors to the anatomy of a specific person. In an example, individual electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703) can have fixed locations with respect to contact between the surface of a band and the surface of a person's head. In an example, individual electrodes or other brain activity sensors can be spring-loaded to maintain a desired level of contact or pressure with the surface of a person's head. In an example, the location, degree of contact, and/or level of pressure between one or more individual electrodes and the surface of a person's head can be adjusted. In an example, adjustment of the degree of contact and/or level of pressure between electrodes or other brain activity sensors and the surface of a person's head can help to customize an EEG monitor to the anatomy of a specific person. In an example, such contact or pressure adjustment can be done by hand. In an example, such contact or pressure adjustment can be done automatically by one or more actuators. In an example, such contact or pressure can be adjusted automatically by an actuator if proper contact or EM signal measurement is reduced or lost while the person is wearing the device. In the example shown in FIG. 7, all of the electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are physically present in the EEG monitor are actively used to monitor the person's brain activity. In an alternative example, an EEG monitor can comprise a large array of electrodes or other brain activity sensors and only a subset of them may be used to monitor a specific person's brain activity. In an example, the selection of a subset of electrodes or brain activity sensors to be actively used can serve to customize electrode or brain activity sensor configuration to the anatomy of a specific person. In an example, selection of a subset of a larger array of electrodes for active use can serve to customize electrode placement for a specific person without having to physically move electrode locations. In an example, an EEG monitor can comprise a large array of potential connection locations for electrodes or other brain activity sensors, but not all of these potential connection locations are used for electrodes or other brain activity sensors for a specific person. In an example, the selection of which connection locations to which electrodes or other brain activity sensors are actually connected can serve to customize the configuration of electrodes or brain activity sensor for a specific person. In an example, the selection of which connection locations are used for electrodes or brain activity sensors can customize an EEG monitor to the anatomy of a specific person. In an example, individual electrodes or brain activity sensors can be selectively inserted by hand into a subset of a large array of connection locations in order to customize the placement of electrodes or other brain activity sensors for use for a specific person. In an example, this can allow customization of electrode or sensor placement for a specific person without having the expense of electrodes or sensors which are not used. In the example shown in FIG. 7, control unit 704 is located where the bands converge. In an alternative example, a control unit can be located at a different location, such as along the length of one of the bands. In an example a control unit can be located at a position in front of a person's ear. In an example, a control unit can be incorporated into an eyewear frame which is physically-integrated into an EEG monitor as part of the same device or is wirelessly-integrated with an EEG monitor as part of an overall system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption. In an example, wearable EEG monitor 702 and/or control unit 704 can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: a power source and/or power-transducing component; a wireless data transmission and data reception component; a data memory component; and a data processor. In an example, wearable EEG monitor 702 and/or control unit 704 can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: a computer-to-human interface such as a display screen, one or more lights, one or more speakers, and/or one or more tactile actuators; a human-to-computer interface such as a touch screen, one or more touch-activated buttons, microphone and speech-recognition capability, and/or gesture recognition capability; one or more accelerometers; one or more cameras; and a GPS component. In an example, wearable EEG monitor 702 and/or control unit 704 can further include one or more sensors selected from the group consisting of: accelerometer, inclinometer, gyroscope, strain gauge, or other motion or position sensor; microphone or other sound sensor; thermometer or other temperature sensor; camera or other imaging sensor; optical sensor or optoelectronic sensor; blood pressure sensor; ECG/EKG sensor, heart rate monitor, and/or heart rate sensor; EMG sensor or other muscle activity sensor; GPS sensor, other location sensor, magnetometer, or compass; spectroscopy sensor or other spectral analysis sensor; electrochemical sensor; blood oximetry sensor; piezoelectric sensor; chewing sensor or swallowing sensor; respiration sensor; pressure sensor; galvanic skin response sensor; and taste or odor sensor. In this example, it is assumed that there are wires or other conductive connections between control unit 704 and electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703). Wires and other conductive connections are well known in the prior art and their exact configuration is not central to this invention. Accordingly, a wire configuration is not shown here. In an alternative example, electrodes or other brain activity sensors can be in wireless communication with a control unit. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a device for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; and a data transmitting member. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a device for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; and a database which includes associations between specific patterns of food consumption and specific patterns of electromagnetic brain activity, which translates specific types and amounts of food into specific types and amounts of nutrients, or which does both. FIGS. 8 through 14 comprise a chronological sequence which shows how wearable EEG monitor 702 can be used to measure and/or modify a person's food consumption. In an example, FIGS. 8 through 14 show how hardware can be used to implement the methods that were disclosed in FIGS. 1 and 2. FIGS. 8 through 10 show the operation of this hardware during a first (calibration) time period in which data concerning food consumption and data concerning brain activity are independently collected and significant associations are identified between patterns of food consumption and patterns of brain activity. FIGS. 11 through 14 show the operation of this hardware during a second (post-calibration) time period in which these associations are then used in combination with subsequent brain activity data in order to measure and/or modify the person's food consumption. Collectively, FIGS. 8 through 14 show a device and system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption using a wearable EEG monitor. FIG. 8 begins a first (calibration) time period sequence by showing person 701 (who is wearing EEG monitor 702) as this person views food 801. In this example, even the sight of food 801 evokes a response in the person's brain and a change 802 in the person's electromagnetic brain activity. In this example, change 802 in the person's electromagnetic brain activity is represented by a “lightning bolt” symbol due to its invisible (to the human eye) electromagnetic nature. This change 802 in brain activity can be called a first-phase of brain activity response to food because it is caused by the sight (and/or smell) of food before the person eats the food. Change 802 in electromagnetic brain activity is measured and/or recorded by the plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703) in EEG monitor 702. FIG. 9 continues the first (calibration) time period sequence by showing person 701 eating food 801. In this example, the taste, smell, and tactile sensations of eating food evoke a second and/or continued response in the person's brain and a second and/or continued change 901 in the person's electromagnetic brain activity. In this example, change 901 is also represented by a “lightning bolt” symbol. Change 901 in the person's brain activity can be called a second-phase of brain activity response to food because it is triggered when the person actually starts eating food. Change 901 in electromagnetic brain activity is measured and/or recorded by the plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 703) in EEG monitor 702. FIG. 10 continues the first (calibration) time period sequence by showing person 701 manually entering information concerning food 801 into a handheld electronic device 1001. In this example, manual entry of data is done using a touch screen. This is represented in FIG. 10 by a dotted-line arrow (1002) next to the person's thumb. In this example, manual entry of information concerning food consumed occurs during a first (calibration) time period. In various examples, a person can manually enter data concerning the types and amounts of food which they eat into a smart phone, electronic tablet, laptop, smart watch, smart wrist band, electronically-functional eyewear, or other electronic device. In various examples, a person can enter food consumption data via a touchscreen, speech recognition interface, gesture recognition interface, EMG recognition interface, eye movement recognition interface, keypad, buttons, or knobs. As shown in FIG. 10, handheld electronic device 1001 and wearable EEG monitor 702 are in wireless communication with each other. This wireless communication is represented by lightning bolt symbols 1003 and 1004 and the dotted-line arrow between them. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 702 and handheld electronic device 1001 together comprise a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption. Wireless communication between EEG monitor 702 and electronic device 1001 enables data concerning food consumption (having been entered into device 1001) and data concerning brain activity (having been recorded by monitor 702) to be chronologically linked and analyzed to identify associations between patterns of food consumption and patterns of electromagnetic brain activity. In an example, the data processing that is required to analyze this data and identify these associations can occur in control unit 704 of wearable EEG monitor 702, in a data processor within handheld device 1001, or in a remote computer with which either the EEG monitor or the handheld device is in wireless communication. In an example, data concerning food consumption and brain activity can be analyzed to create a food-brainwave database which links specific patterns of food consumption with specific patterns of brain activity. In an example, manual entry of food consumption information can be facilitated by an application on the handheld electronic device which provides a menu of common food items, including their images and descriptions. In an example, food consumption data can be collected and/or supplemented by having the person manually take pictures of food before a meal and a picture of any unconsumed food that remains after the meal. In an example, food consumption data can be collected and/or supplemented by analysis of images which are automatically taken by electronically-functional eyewear or a wearable camera. In an example, the amount of food eaten can be estimated by the difference in food volume between a before-meal food image and an after-meal food image. In an example, food consumption data can be collected and/or supplemented by the use of a smart food utensil, mobile food probe, or mobile food scanner. In an example, a smart food utensil, mobile food probe, or mobile food scanner can include a spectroscopic sensor for analyzing the chemical composition of food. In an example, food consumption data can be collected and/or supplemented by scanning a bar code or other unique content on food packaging or a restaurant menu. During a first (calibration) time period shown in FIGS. 8 through 10, data concerning the person's food consumption, including consumption of food 801, is collected by a means other than analysis of electromagnetic brain activity. Also, during the first (calibration) time period shown in FIGS. 8 through 10, data concerning the person's electromagnetic brain activity, including changes 802 and 901, is collected using wearable EEG monitor 702. Data concerning food consumption and brain activity are then jointly analyzed to identify significant associations between food consumption patterns and brain activity patterns. In various examples, first-phase change 802 and second-phase change 901 in the person's electromagnetic brain activity can be measured and analyzed separately, sequentially, or jointly in order to link patterns of food consumption to patterns of brain activity. In this example, two phases of food consumption (before eating and during eating) are measured and analyzed. In an alternative example, only one phase of food consumption may be measured and analyzed. In an alternative example, three phases of food consumption (before eating, during eating, and after digestion) may be measured and analyzed. In an example, changes 802 and 901 can be linked to food consumption in general, without identifying a specific type of food. In an example, changes 802 and 901 can be linked to the consumption of specific types and amounts of food, ingredients, and/or nutrients, such as the specific types and amounts of ingredients in food 801. FIGS. 11 through 14 show the operation of this hardware during a second (post-calibration) time period in which associations between food consumption and brain activity are used, in combination with monitored brain activity data, to measure and/or modify the person's food consumption. In an example, these associations can be embodied in a food-brainwave database. In an example, these associations can be embodied in a statistical model with estimated parameters. In an example, associations and/or a food-brainwave database can have been created de novo for person 701 during a first (calibration) time period for person 701. In an alternative example, associations and/or a food-brainwave database can have been created for a general population and adapted for use for person 701. In an example, use of population-based associations and/or a population-based food-brainwave database can reduce or entirely eliminate the need for a first (calibration) time period for person 701. FIG. 11 shows person 701 eating food 801 in a second (post calibration) time period. In this example, there is no independent entry of food consumption information during this second (post calibration) time period. During this second (post calibration) time period, food consumption is estimated based on the person's electromagnetic brain activity. In FIG. 11, the person's consumption of food 801 triggers a change (901) in the person's electromagnetic brain activity. Change 901 in brain activity is measured by wearable EEG monitor 702. In FIG. 12, data concerning the person's brain activity, including change 901 in response to consumption of food 801, is wirelessly transmitted from control unit 704 of wearable EEG monitor 702 to handheld electronic device 1001. This wireless transmission is represented by lightning bolt symbols 1201 and 1202. In an example, data concerning the person's brain activity during an extended period of time can be measured and recorded. In an example, this extended period of time can be several hours or an entire day. In an example, this extended period of time can include multiple food consumption events, of which eating food 801 is only one event. In an example, brain activity data can be wirelessly transmitted from wearable EEG monitor 702 to handheld electronic device 1001 at regular time intervals during an extended period of time, after each food consumption event, or at the end of the extended period of time. In an example, data concerning changes in a person's brain activity for an extended period of time can be used to estimate the person's cumulative food consumption during this period of time. In this manner, a log of the person's food consumption can be automatically created for this period of time. In an example, this automatic log of food consumption can be at the level of overall food consumption and/or total calories. In an example, this automatic log of food consumption can be at the level of specific types and amounts of foods, ingredients, and/or nutrients. FIG. 13 shows an example of how a system or device can convey feedback to a person in order to modify their food consumption. In FIG. 13, person 701 is shown receiving visual feedback 1301 (represented here by an exclamation point) concerning their food consumption from handheld electronic device 1001. In an example, feedback 1301 can be a warning that the person has consumed an unhealthy type or amount of food. In an example, feedback 1301 can be a warning that the person has not consumed a selected healthy food. In an example, feedback 1301 can indicate that the person has eaten too many calories overall compared to their caloric expenditure during a selected period of time. In an example, feedback 1301 can indicate that the person has eaten an unhealthy ingredient and/or an ingredient to which they are allergic. In an example, feedback 1301 can be a text message. In an example, feedback 1301 can comprise a negative expression on an animated face or avatar. In example, feedback 1301 can include positive suggestions for how the person can modify their food consumption in a healthier manner in order to achieve their health goals. In other examples, feedback to modify a person's food consumption can be conveyed to the person through a different visual, auditory, or tactile interface. The behavior of person 701 in FIG. 14 indicates that feedback 1301 has been successful in modifying the person's food consumption. In FIG. 14, the person has seen food 801 in a bowl, but the person turns away from the food rather than eating it because of feedback 1301 which the person received in FIG. 13. In an example, feedback 1301 may have indicated that the person has eaten too many fatty snacks today and should avoid eating more fatty snacks. In an example, the person is turning away from a bowl of fatty snacks in FIG. 14 after having received such feedback. In an example, a device and system for modifying a person's food consumption using a wearable EEG monitor can help to strengthen a person's willpower to avoid over-consumption of unhealthy types or amounts of food. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; and a smart phone, tablet, or other electronically-functional handheld device. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; a smart phone, tablet, or other electronically-functional handheld device; and a database which includes associations between specific patterns of food consumption and specific patterns of electromagnetic brain activity, which translates specific types and amounts of food into specific types and amounts of nutrients, or which does both. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a device for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; and a visual interface for computer-to-human communication. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a device for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a visual interface for computer-to-human communication; and a database which includes associations between specific patterns of food consumption and specific patterns of electromagnetic brain activity, which translates specific types and amounts of food into specific types and amounts of nutrients, or which does both. FIGS. 15 and 16 show another example of how wearable EEG monitor 702 can be used to modify a person's food consumption. This example involves interactive feedback concerning the person's electromagnetic brain activity patterns. In this example, person 701 modifies their food consumption by self-modifying their electromagnetic brain activity patterns. FIGS. 15 through 16 show an example of hardware that can be used to implement the biofeedback methods that were disclosed in FIGS. 4 and 6. FIG. 15 shows person 701 interacting with handheld electronic device 1504 which, in turn, is in wireless communication with wearable EEG monitor 702. This wireless communication is represented by lightning bolt symbol 1503 and the dotted-line arrow between handheld electronic device 1504 and wearable EEG monitor 702. FIG. 15 also shows a self-modified change in the person's electromagnetic brain activity from a first pattern 1501 to a second pattern 1505. In an example, first pattern 1501 can be an electromagnetic brain activity pattern which is generally associated with hunger and second pattern 1505 can be an electromagnetic brain activity pattern which is generally associated with satiety. In an example, person 701 can receive interactive feedback concerning their electromagnetic brain activity pattern as measured by wearable EEG monitor 702, wirelessly transmitted to handheld electronic device 1504, and visually displayed on the screen of electronic device 1504. In an example, the visual display on electronic device 1504 can change as the person's brain activity pattern changes. In an example, changes in the visual display can help person 701 to self-modify their brain activity pattern in a way which modifies their food consumption. In an example, when the visual display is changed to a selected configuration, this indicates that the person's brain activity has changed from first pattern 1501 to second pattern 1505. In an example, when the person has modified the visual display to a selected configuration, then this indicates that the person has modified their brain activity pattern to one which is generally associated with satiety. FIG. 16 shows that the person's self-modification of their electromagnetic brain activity has successfully modified their food consumption behavior. In this example, the person has seen food 801 in a bowl, but is turning away from food 801 rather than eating it. In this example, the person has been enabled to turn away from food 801 because they have self-modified their electromagnetic brain activity to a pattern 1505 which is generally associated with satiety. In an example, this is a case of “mind over platter.” In this example, the interactive feedback by which the person self-modifies their brain activity is visual feedback via a handheld electronic device. In another example, interactive feedback can be embodied in audio feedback—such as a series or tones or music whose parameters are changed by changes in measured brain activity. In another example, interactive feedback can be embodied in tactile feedback—such as a series of vibrations or pressure points applied to the person's skin by a wearable electronic device. FIGS. 17 through 20 show some additional examples of systems of wirelessly-connected devices including a wearable EEG monitor which are used to measure and/or modify a person's food consumption. FIG. 17 shows a system comprising wearable EEG monitor 702 and smart watch (or other electronically-functional wrist band) 1701 which are in wireless communication with each other. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 702 and smart watch (or wrist band) 1701 together comprise a wirelessly-linked system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption. Wireless communication between wearable EEG monitor 702 and smart watch (or wrist band) 1701 is represented by lightning bolt symbols 1702 and 1003 and the dotted-line bidirectional arrow between them. In an example, smart watch (or wrist band) 1701 can comprise a convenient user interface for this system. In an example, smart watch (or wrist band) 1701 can comprise a human-to-computer interface for the system for entering information concerning food consumption during a first (calibration) period. In an example, smart watch (or wrist band) 1701 can house key data processing and/or transmitting components for this system. In an example, smart watch (or wrist band) 1701 can comprise a computer-to-human interface for providing feedback to the person from the system in order to modify the person's food consumption. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; and a smart watch and/or electronically-functional band which is configured to be worn on a person's wrist. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; a smart watch and/or electronically-functional band which is configured to be worn on a person's wrist; and a database which includes associations between specific patterns of food consumption and specific patterns of electromagnetic brain activity, which translates specific types and amounts of food into specific types and amounts of nutrients, or which does both. FIG. 18 shows a system comprising wearable EEG monitor 702 and electronically-functional eyewear 1801 which are in wireless communication with each other. In this example, wearable EEG monitor and eyewear 1801 together comprise a wirelessly-linked system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption. Wireless communication between wearable EEG monitor 702 and electronically-functional eyewear 1801 is represented by lightning bolt symbols 1802 and 1003 and the dotted-line arrow between them. In an example, electronically-functional eyewear 1801 can comprise a convenient user interface for this system. In an example, electronically-functional eyewear 1801 can comprise a wearable camera whose images are analyzed to provide information concerning food consumption during a first (calibration) period. In an example, electronically-functional eyewear 1801 can house key data processing and/or transmitting components for this system. In an example, electronically-functional eyewear 1801 can comprise a computer-to-human interface for providing augmented reality visual feedback to modify the person's food consumption. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; and a pair of smart glasses and/or electronically-functional eyewear which is configured to be worn on a person's head. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; a pair of smart glasses and/or electronically-functional eyewear which is configured to be worn on a person's head; and a database which includes associations between specific patterns of food consumption and specific patterns of electromagnetic brain activity, which translates specific types and amounts of food into specific types and amounts of nutrients, or which does both. FIG. 19 shows a system comprising wearable EEG monitor 702 and a neck-worn device 1902 which are in wireless communication with each other. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 702 and neck-worn device 1902 together comprise a wirelessly-linked system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption. Wireless communication between wearable EEG monitor 702 and neck-worn device 1902 is represented by lightning bolt symbols 1903 and 1003 and the dotted-line arrow between them. In an example, neck-worn device 1902 can comprise an electronically-functional necklace and/or a wearable camera. In an example, a neck-worn device comprising a wearable camera can take pictures of food 1901 as a person eats. Analysis of such food images can provide food consumption tracking during a first (calibration) time period. In an example, neck-worn device 1902 can further comprise a microphone. In an example, to help preserve visual privacy, a wearable camera may only be activated to take pictures when a microphone detects chewing and/or swallowing sounds which indicate that the person is probably eating. In an example, neck-worn device 1902 can further comprise a convenient user interface for this system and/or house key data processing components for this system. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; and a smart necklace and/or electronically-functional device which is configured to worn on a person's neck. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; a smart necklace and/or electronically-functional device which is configured to worn on a person's neck; and a database which includes associations between specific patterns of food consumption and specific patterns of electromagnetic brain activity, which translates specific types and amounts of food into specific types and amounts of nutrients, or which does both. FIG. 20 shows a system comprising a wearable EEG monitor 702 and an intraoral food sensor 2002. These two components of the system are in wireless communication with each other. Together, wearable EEG monitor 702 and intraoral food sensor 2002 comprise a wirelessly-linked system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption. In an example, intraoral food sensor 2002 can be attached to, or implanted within, the palatal vault of the person's mouth. In an example, intraoral food sensor can be attached to the person's teeth, gums, or jaw. In an example, intraoral food sensor can be attached to, or implanted within, the person's tongue. In an example, intraoral food sensor can be in fluid communication with saliva and other intraoral fluids and materials. In an example, intraoral food sensor 2002 can analyze micro-samples of intraoral fluids in order to determine their chemical composition. In an example, for better operational efficiency, intraoral food sensor 2002 may only analyze micro-samples of intraoral fluids when other sensors (such as chewing sensors or swallow sensors) suggest that the person is eating something. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; and a device which is configured to be in fluid communication with a person's mouth or other portion of the person's gastrointestinal tract. In an example, this invention can be embodied in a system for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption comprising: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors which are configured to be worn less than one inch from the surface of a person's head; a mobile power source and/or power transducer, wherein a power transducer harvests power from human physiological activity and/or environmental energy sources; a data processor; a data transmitter; a device which is configured to be in fluid communication with a person's mouth or other portion of the person's gastrointestinal tract; and a database which includes associations between specific patterns of food consumption and specific patterns of electromagnetic brain activity, which translates specific types and amounts of food into specific types and amounts of nutrients, or which does both. FIG. 21 shows a left-side view of another example of how this invention can be embodied in a wearable EEG monitor that is used to measure and/or modify a person's food consumption. In this example, this invention is embodied as a hybrid wearable EEG monitor with an integrated eyewear frame. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 2101 serves as both a brain activity monitor and electronically-functional eyewear. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 2101 comprises: a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 2102); a control unit 2103; and a wearable camera 2104.

In this example, the anterior portion of wearable EEG monitor 2101 serves as an eyewear frame and the posterior portion of wearable EEG monitor 2101 loops completely around the back of the person's head. In this example, the front of this device rests on the bridge of the person's nose and the sides of this device rest on the person's ears. In this example, the anterior and posterior portions of this device form a continuous arcing band which encircles the person's head at a relatively-constant level which is just above the person's nose and ears. In this example, the eyewear portion of this device has lenses, but no display screen. In another example, the eyewear portion of this device may have a display screen, but no lenses. In another example, the eyewear portion of this device may have both a display screen and lenses. In an example, the eyewear portion of this device can serve as an augmented reality interface.

FIG. 22 shows a wearable EEG monitor for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption that is that same as the one disclosed in FIG. 7, except that it now includes one or more wearable cameras 2201. In this example, a wearable camera 2201 is positioned on the side of a person's head near the point where multiple bands converge. In an example, two wearable cameras positioned on the left and right sides of the person's head can provide stereoscopic images of food during a first (calibration) time period. These images can be analyzed to estimate food consumption during the calibration period. In an example, visual pattern recognition can be used to determine food types. In an example, 3D modeling of stereoscopic images can be used to estimate food amounts. In an example, wearable camera 2201 can take video pictures continually. In an example, in order to help maintain visual privacy, wearable camera 2201 may only be activated to take video pictures when data from other sources (such as motion sensors or sound sensors) suggests that the person is probably eating. In an example, in order to help maintain visual privacy, wearable camera 2201 may have a short focal length.

FIG. 23 shows a wearable EEG monitor that includes integrated eyewear, like the one disclosed in FIG. 21, but which also includes two upper arcuate members which loop over the top of the person's head. The addition of these two upper arcuate members increases the range of electrodes or other brain activity members covering the person's head. The addition of these two upper arcuate members provides electromagnetic recording coverage of the person's parietal lobe and upper occipital lobe. This can provide improved measurement of brain activity related to hunger and auditory sensation. In this example, control unit 2303 is located in front of the person's ears. In an example, control unit 2303 can further comprise a power source, a data processor, a data transmitter, and a user interface. In this example, the bottom portions of the two upper arcuate members converge at locations just above the person's ears.

FIG. 25 shows an example of a wearable EEG monitor (2501) for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption that is similar to the one disclosed in FIG. 24, except that at least one of the two rear arcuate members can be radially-pivoted around their convergence point (where control unit 2503 is located, in this example). This pivoting action is represented in FIG. 25 by an arcuate dotted-line arrow above the upper rear arcuate member. This pivoting action changes the angle at which the two rear arcuate members diverge as they loop around the back of the person's head. This pivoting action enables customization and/or adjustment of the locations of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 2502) which span the person's occipital lobe and/or parietal lobe. In an example, this device can also comprise a control unit which further comprises a power source, a data processor, and a data transmitter. FIG. 26 shows another example of a wearable EEG monitor (2601) with an integrated eyewear frame which measures and/or modifies a person's food consumption. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 2601 comprises a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 2603) and a wearable camera 2602. In an example, this device can also comprise a control unit which further comprises a power source, a data processor, and a data transmitter. In this example, the anterior portion of wearable EEG monitor 2601 is an eyewear frame. In this example, the posterior portion of wearable EEG monitor 2601: starts near the bottom of the left ear, curves up around the rear of the left ear, loops over the top of the person's head, curves down around the rear of the right ear, and then ends near the bottom of the right ear. In this example, the anterior potion of the device rests on the bridge of the person's nose and the posterior portions of the device rest on the tops of the person's ears. FIG. 27 shows another example of a wearable EEG monitor (2701) with an integrated eyewear frame which measures and/or modifies a person's food consumption. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 2701 comprises a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 2703) and a wearable camera 2702. In an example, this device can also comprise a control unit which further comprises a power source, a data processor, and a data transmitter. In this example, the anterior portion of wearable EEG monitor 2701 is an eyewear frame. In this example, the device: spans backward from the bridge of the person's nose to a position atop the person's left ear; then curves up and over the top of the person's head; then curves down to a position atop the person's right ear; and then spans forward to the bridge of the person's nose. In this example, the anterior portion of this device rests on the bridge of the person's nose and the side portions of this device rest on the tops of the person's ears. The sequence in FIGS. 28 through 32 shows an example of how the wearable EEG monitor that was introduced in FIG. 27 can be used to measure and modify a person's food consumption. In FIG. 28, person 701 sees (and smells) food 2801, but has not yet started to eat it. In FIG. 29, person 701 eats food 2801, which triggers a change 2901 in the electromagnetic brain activity which is recorded by the electrodes (including 2703) on wearable EEG monitor 2701. In an example, camera 2702 can take pictures of food 2801. In an example, the system can use previously-identified associations between food consumption and brain activity to identify the type and amount of food consumed, including food 2801, during a period of time. In an example, the system can automatically create a log of food consumption during this period of time. In FIG. 30, person 701 receives feedback 3003 from the system via a handheld electronic device 1001 in order to modify their food consumption. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 2701 and handheld electronic device 1001 are in wireless communication, as represented by lightning bolt symbols 3001 and 3002. In an example, an automatically-created food log based on brain activity patterns can indicate that the person has eaten an unhealthy type and/or amount of food during a period of time. In an example, feedback based on this log may suggest that the person should modify their food consumption to improve their nutrition, manage their energy balance, and/or meet health goals. In an example, a person can directly modify their food consumption based on feedback 3003. In another example, as shown in FIG. 31, person 701 can indirectly modify their food consumption via self-modification of brain activity. In this latter example, shown in FIG. 31, person 701 uses an interactive biofeedback interface 3103 to self-modify their brain activity pattern which, in turn, modifies their food consumption. In various examples, an interactive biofeedback interface can be visual, auditory, and/or tactile. In this example, wearable EEG monitor 2701 and handheld electronic device 1001 share interactive wireless communication, as represented by lightning bolt symbols 3101 and 3102. In an example, person 701 can use interactive biofeedback interface 3103 to self-modify their brain activity pattern from a first pattern 3104 which is generally associated with hunger to a second pattern 3105 which is generally associated with satiety. In an example, when the person is able to self-modify their brain activity to a pattern associated with satiety, they can better avoid eating an unhealthy amount or type of food. In an example, person 701 can initiate use of biofeedback interface 3103 based on feedback 3003. In an example, the person can initiate use of this biofeedback interface 3103 on their own, without prompting by feedback from a system. FIG. 32 shows person 701 turning away from a bowl of food 2801 instead of eating it. In an example, this modification of food consumption can be a direct result of feedback 3003 that was shown in FIG. 30. In an example, this modification of food consumption can be an indirect result of self-modification of brain activity patterns with the help of interactive biofeedback interface 3103, as shown in FIG. 31. In an example, this modification of food consumption can be the combined result of direct feedback and interactive biofeedback. FIG. 33 shows an example of a wearable EEG monitor 3301 for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption which integrates both eyewear and headphone components. Wearable EEG monitor 3301 comprises a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 3303) and wearable camera 3302. In an example, this monitor can further comprise a control unit which, in turn, can comprise a power source, a data processor, and a data transmitter. In this example, the anterior portion of wearable EEG monitor comprises eyewear frames. In this example, the posterior portion of wearable EEG monitor comprises a set of headphones which cover the person's ears and loop over the top of the person's head. In this example, the eyewear frame and headphones are integrated into a single device. FIG. 34 shows an example of a wearable EEG monitor 3401 for measuring and/or modifying a person's food consumption which is shaped like headphones which cover a person's ears and loop over the top of their head. Wearable EEG monitor 3401 comprises a plurality of electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 3403) and one or more wearable cameras (including 3402). In an example, this monitor can further comprise a control unit which, in turn, can comprise a power source, a data processor, and a data transmitter. FIGS. 35 through 41 show examples of how wearable EEG monitor 3401 can be used to measure and/or modify a person's food consumption. FIG. 35 shows how one or more wearable cameras (including 3402) can take pictures of food 2801 before it is eaten. FIG. 36 shows how one or more wearable cameras (including 3402) can take pictures of food while it is being eaten. FIG. 36 also shows how electrodes or other brain activity sensors (including 3403) can record a change 2901 in electromagnetic brain activity which is caused by the consumption of food 2801. FIG. 37 shows wearable EEG monitor 3401 being in wireless communication with handheld electronic device 1001 and conveying feedback 3703 concerning food consumption to the person. FIG. 38 shows wearable EEG monitor 3401 being in wireless communication with handheld electronic device 1001 and helping the person to self-modify their brain activity using interactive biofeedback interface 3803. In an example, this biofeedback helps the person to self-modify their brain activity from a first pattern 3804 that is associated with hunger to a second pattern 3805 that is associated with satiety. FIG. 39 shows that the person turns away from food 2801 due to feedback 3703, self-modification of brain activity to a satiety pattern 3805, or both.

In this example, the wearable EEG monitor can also detect eating by detecting chewing and/or swallowing sounds. FIG. 41 shows a variation on the headphone-style wearable EEG monitor in which an interactive biofeedback interface is auditory in nature. In this example, changes in sound tones and/or musical parameters help person 701 to self-modify their brain activity pattern from a first pattern 3804 to a second pattern 3805. This change in brain activity pattern, in turn, modifies their food consumption.

In this example, sensor-positioning member 5201 is assumed to be substantially symmetric with respect to the left side (shown) and the right side (not shown) of the wearer's head. This monitor further comprises control unit 5203, which need not be replicated on the right side. In the example shown in FIG. 52, sensor-positioning member 5201 is configured to loop over the top portion of the wearer's head in a manner similar to the rim of a (skull) cap in which the right and left sides have been elongated. In this example, the right and left sides come down to locations just above the wearer's ears. In various examples, sensor-holding member 5201 can be shaped like a two-dimensional circle, oval, ellipse, oblong shape, egg shape, or conic section which has been curved in three-dimensional space in order to conform to the top portion of the wearer's head. In an example, a portion of sensor-positioning member 5201 that is anterior to the wearer's ears spans an upper portion of the wearer's temporal lobe, a lower portion of their central sulcus, and a posterior portion of their cerebral cortex. In an example, electrodes or other brain activity sensors on sensor-positioning member 5201 collect data on brain activity concerning short term memory, emotion, smell, hunger, and/or taste. This brain activity data can be associated with selected quantities and types of food consumption and/or can be used to identify quantities and types of food consumed. In an example, a portion of the sensor-positioning member 5201 that is posterior to the wearer's ears spans an upper portion of the wearer's temporal lobe and a posterior portion of their occipital lobe. In an example, electrodes or other brain activity sensors on sensor-positioning member 5201 collect data on brain activity concerning the sight, image recognition, and/or speech.

In this example, a device or system directly and actively modifies a person's electromagnetic brain activity in order to modify their food consumption. This method, device, or system modifies electromagnetic brain activity directly, rather than relying on the feedback or self-modification of brain activity discussed in earlier examples. In this example, a wearable EEG device not only measures electromagnetic brain activity, but also directly modifies electromagnetic brain activity.

In an example, surface electromagnetic patterns (detected at selected locations on the surface of a person's head) can be analyzed to estimate the interior electromagnetic patterns (within particular brain regions) which caused these surface electromagnetic patterns. In an example, a three-dimensional model of the electromagnetic field which created a surface electromagnetic pattern can be created. In an example, this three-dimensional model of the electromagnetic field can then be used to infer the interior electromagnetic pattern which created the surface electromagnetic pattern. In an example, this three-dimensional model of the electromagnetic field can also be used, in reverse, to infer the surface electromagnetic pattern which would be required to recreate the interior electromagnetic pattern. In an example, a surface electromagnetic pattern which is associated with satiety can be identified. In an example, the interior electromagnetic pattern which is associated with this surface electromagnetic pattern can be determined using a three-dimensional model of the brain's electromagnetic field. In an example, the surface electromagnetic pattern which would be required or recreate an interior electromagnetic pattern associated with satiety can be determined using the three-dimensional model in reverse. Finally, in an example, a person can be given a feeling of satiety by recreating this required surface electromagnetic pattern via an array of electromagnetic transmitters on the surface of their head. In an example, a wearable EEG device has such electromagnetic transmitters and thus have the capability to induce a feeling of satiety.

Finally, in an example, a person can be given a eating good-tasting food by recreating this required surface electromagnetic pattern via an array of electromagnetic transmitters on the surface of their head. In an example, this can help a person to enjoy eating healthy food whose taste they would otherwise not enjoy.

In an example, a moveable sensor arm can be at least partially connected to a face-spanning support member and can hold at least one electromagnetic energy sensor which collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity. In an example, a moveable sensor arm can be moved relative to a face-spanning support member from a first arm configuration to a second arm configuration, and vice versa. In an example, in the first arm configuration, the moveable sensor arm holds the electromagnetic energy sensor in a selected location from which the electromagnetic energy sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity. In the second arm configuration the moveable sensor arm holds the electromagnetic energy sensor in a different location. In an example, a moveable sensor arm can be visually less-obtrusive in a second arm configuration than in a first arm configuration.

In an example, the selected location from which an electromagnetic energy sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 135 comprises: face-spanning support member 13501, two optical members (including optical member 13502), electromagnetic energy sensor 13503, moveable sensor arm 13504, and connecting axle 13505. Connecting axle 13505 connects moveable sensor arm 13504 with face-spanning support member 13501. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 13501 is a single-piece member which spans from one ear to the other. In this example, face-spanning support member 13501 has two side portions (which each span from an ear to the front of the face) and a front portion (which spans the face from one side to the other). Although the far side portion is not shown [sorry, Gary] in the angled perspective of FIG. 135, the device in this example is assumed to be symmetric with respect to a central longitudinal (right-vs.-left) plane of the person's head. In this example, side portions are horizontally aligned with the person's eyes and the front portion is horizontally aligned with the person's eyebrows. In this example, the optical members (including 13502) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 13501 and optical members (including 13502) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 13503 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13506 is on a person's forehead and/or temple. As shown in FIG. 135, moveable sensor arm 13504 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13506 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 135, moveable sensor arm 13504 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is substantially hidden behind (interior to) the side portion of face-spanning support member 13501. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13504 pivots and/or rotates around axle 13505 in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. In this example, axle 13505 is located near an ear. In this example, in the second arm configuration moveable sensor arm 13504 spans forward from axle 13505 toward the front of the person's face. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13504 is slightly arcuate. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13504 can be straight. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13504 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13504 can be moved automatically by an actuator. FIG. 136 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; an electromagnetic energy sensor, wherein this electromagnetic energy sensor has a first sensor configuration wherein it is configured to be at a selected location relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein this electromagnetic energy sensor has a second sensor configuration wherein it is not at this selected location; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 136 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 13604 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 13603 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 13603 is at a selected location from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13606. The upper half of FIG. 136 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 13604 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 13603 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 13603 is not at the selected location. In an example, the selected location from which an electromagnetic energy sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 136 comprises: face-spanning support member 13601, two optical members (including optical member 13602), electromagnetic energy sensor 13603, moveable sensor arm 13604, and connecting axle 13605. Connecting axle 13605 connects moveable sensor arm 13604 with face-spanning support member 13601. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 13601 is a single-piece member which spans from one ear to the other. In this example, face-spanning support member 13601 has two side portions (which each span from an ear to the front of the face) and a front portion (which spans the face from one side to the other). Although the far side portion is not shown [sorry, Gary] in the angled perspective of FIG. 136, the device in this example is assumed to be symmetric with respect to a central longitudinal (right-vs.-left) plane of the person's head. In this example, side portions are horizontally aligned with the person's eyes and the front portion is horizontally aligned with the person's eyebrows. In this example, the optical members (including 13602) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 13601 and optical members (including 13602) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 13603 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13606 is on a person's forehead and/or temple. As shown in FIG. 136, moveable sensor arm 13604 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13606 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 136, moveable sensor arm 13604 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is substantially hidden behind (interior to) the side portion of face-spanning support member 13601. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13604 pivots and/or rotates around axle 13605 in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. In this example, axle 13605 is located between the person's ear and the front of the person's face. In this example, in the second arm configuration, moveable sensor arm 13604 spans from axle 13605 backward toward the person's ear. In another example, in the second arm configuration, moveable sensor arm 13604 can span from axle 13605 forward toward the person's face. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13604 is slightly arcuate. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13604 can be straight. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13604 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13604 can be moved automatically by an actuator. FIG. 137 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; an electromagnetic energy sensor, wherein this electromagnetic energy sensor has a first sensor configuration wherein it is configured to be at a selected location relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein this electromagnetic energy sensor has a second sensor configuration wherein it is not at this selected location; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 137 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 13704 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 13703 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 13703 is at a selected location from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13706. The upper half of FIG. 137 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 13704 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 13703 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 13703 is not at the selected location. In an example, the selected location from which an electromagnetic energy sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 137 comprises: face-spanning support member 13701, two optical members (including optical member 13702), electromagnetic energy sensor 13703, moveable sensor arm 13704, and connecting axle 13705. Connecting axle 13705 connects moveable sensor arm 13704 with face-spanning support member 13701. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 13701 is a single-piece member which spans from one ear to the other. In this example, face-spanning support member 13701 has two side portions (which each span from an ear to the front of the face) and a front portion (which spans the face from one side to the other). Although the far side portion is not shown [sorry, Gary] in the angled perspective of FIG. 137, the device in this example is assumed to be symmetric with respect to a central longitudinal (right-vs.-left) plane of the person's head. In this example, side portions are horizontally aligned with the person's eyes and the front portion is horizontally aligned with the person's eyebrows. In this example, the optical members (including 13702) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 13701 and optical members (including 13702) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 13703 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13706 is on the forehead. As shown in FIG. 137, moveable sensor arm 13704 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13706 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 137, moveable sensor arm 13704 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is substantially hidden behind (interior to) the side portion of face-spanning support member 13701. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13704 pivots and/or rotates around axle 13705 in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. In this example, axle 13705 is located near the front of a side portion of face-spanning support member 13701. In this example, in the second arm configuration, moveable sensor arm 13704 spans backward from axle 13705 toward the person's ear. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13704 is slightly arcuate. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13704 can be straight. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13704 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13704 can be moved automatically by an actuator. FIG. 138 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; an electromagnetic energy sensor, wherein this electromagnetic energy sensor has a first sensor configuration wherein it is configured to be at a selected location relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein this electromagnetic energy sensor has a second sensor configuration wherein it is not at this selected location; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensor in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 138 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 13804 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 13803 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 13803 is at a selected location from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13806. The upper half of FIG. 138 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 13804 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 13803 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 13803 is not at the selected location. In an example, the selected location from which an electromagnetic energy sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 138 comprises: face-spanning support member 13801, two optical members (including optical member 13802), electromagnetic energy sensor 13803, moveable sensor arm 13804, and connecting axle 13805. Connecting axle 13805 connects moveable sensor arm 13804 with face-spanning support member 13801. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 13801 is a single-piece member which spans from one ear to the other. In this example, face-spanning support member 13801 has two side portions (which each span from an ear to the front of the face) and a front portion (which spans the face from one side to the other). Although the far side portion is not shown [sorry, Gary] in the angled perspective of FIG. 138, the device in this example is assumed to be symmetric with respect to a central longitudinal (right-vs.-left) plane of the person's head. In this example, side portions are horizontally aligned with the person's eyes and the front portion is horizontally aligned with the person's eyebrows. In this example, the optical members (including 13802) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 13801 and optical members (including 13802) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 13803 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13806 is on a person's forehead. As shown in FIG. 138, moveable sensor arm 13804 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13806 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 138, moveable sensor arm 13804 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is substantially hidden behind (interior to) the front portion of face-spanning support member 13801. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13804 pivots and/or rotates around axle 13805 in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. In this example, axle 13805 is located near the middle of the front portion of face-spanning support member 13801. In this example, in the second arm configuration, moveable sensor arm 13804 spans sideways from axle 13805. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13804 is straight. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13804 can be arcuate. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13804 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13804 can be moved automatically by an actuator. In this example, there is one central moveable sensor arm and one central electromagnetic energy sensor. In another example, there can be two moveable sensor arms and two electromagnetic energy sensors, one on each side of the forehead and/or one above each of the two optical members. FIG. 139 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 139 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 13905 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensors 13903 and 13904 are in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensors 13903 and 13904 are at selected locations from which they collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13907 and 13908. The upper half of FIG. 139 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 13905 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensors 13903 and 13904 are in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensors 13903 and 13904 are not at these selected locations. In an example, the selected locations from which electromagnetic energy sensors collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 139 comprises: face-spanning support member 13901, two optical members (including optical member 13902), electromagnetic energy sensors 13903 and 13904, moveable sensor arm 13905, and connecting axles (including 13906). Connecting axle 13906 connects moveable sensor arm 13905 with face-spanning support member 13901. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 13901 is a single-piece member which spans from one ear to the other. In this example, face-spanning support member 13901 has two side portions (which each span from an ear to the front of the face) and a front portion (which spans the face from one side to the other). Although the far side portion is not shown [sorry, Gary] in the angled perspective of FIG. 139, the device in this example is assumed to be symmetric with respect to a central longitudinal (right-vs.-left) plane of the person's head. In this example, side portions are horizontally aligned with the person's eyes and the front portion is horizontally aligned with the person's eyebrows in the second arm configuration. In this example, the two optical members (including 13902) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 13901 and the two optical members (including 13902) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected locations from which electromagnetic energy sensors 13903 and 13904 collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13907 and 13908 are on a person's forehead and/or temple. In an example, there can be a greater number of electromagnetic energy sensors on moveable sensor arm 13905. As shown in FIG. 139, moveable sensor arm 13905 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 13907 and 13908 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 139, moveable sensor arm 13905 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is substantially hidden behind, aligned with, and interior to face-spanning support member 13901. In this example, in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 13905 is substantially aligned with, hidden behind, and interior to face-spanning support member 13901. In this example, in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 13905 is pivoted and/or rotated upwards to span the person's forehead. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13905 pivots and/or rotates around axle 13906 in order to change from the second arm configuration to the first arm configuration, or vice versa. In this example, axle 13906 is located near the person's ear. Although not shown, in this example a similar axle is assumed to be on the other side of the person's head due to assumed device symmetry. In this example, moveable sensor arm 13905 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 13905 can be moved automatically by an actuator. FIG. 140 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 140 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 14005 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensors 14003 and 14004 are in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensors 14003 and 14004 are at selected locations on the upper portion of a person's head from which they collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14007 and 14008. The upper half of FIG. 140 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 14005 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensors 14003 and 14004 are in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensors 14003 and 14004 are not at these selected locations. In an example, the selected locations from which electromagnetic energy sensors collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 140 comprises: face-spanning support member 14001, two optical members (including optical member 14002), electromagnetic energy sensors 14003 and 14004, moveable sensor arm 14005, and connecting axles (including 14006). Connecting axle 14006 connects moveable sensor arm 14005 with face-spanning support member 14001. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 14001 is a single-piece member which spans from one ear to the other. In this example, face-spanning support member 14001 has two side portions (which each span from an ear to the front of the face) and a front portion (which spans the face from one side to the other). Although the far side portion is not shown [sorry, Gary] in the angled perspective of FIG. 140, the device in this example is assumed to be symmetric with respect to a central longitudinal (right-vs.-left) plane of the person's head. In this example, side portions are horizontally aligned with the person's eyes and the front portion is horizontally aligned with the person's eyebrows in the second arm configuration. In this example, the two optical members (including 14002) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 14001 and the two optical members (including 14002) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected locations from which electromagnetic energy sensors 14003 and 14004 collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14007 and 14008 are on the upper portion of a person's head. In an example, there can be a greater number of electromagnetic energy sensors on moveable sensor arm 14005. As shown in FIG. 140, moveable sensor arm 14005 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14007 and 14008 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 140, moveable sensor arm 14005 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is substantially hidden behind, aligned with, and interior to face-spanning support member 14001. In this example, in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14005 is substantially aligned with, hidden behind, and interior to face-spanning support member 14001. In this example, in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14005 is pivoted and/or rotated upwards to span an upper portion of a person's head. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14005 pivots and/or rotates around axle 14006 in order to change from the second arm configuration to the first arm configuration, or vice versa. In this example, axle 14006 is located near the person's ear. Although not shown, in this example a similar axle is assumed to be on the other side of the person's head due to assumed device symmetry. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14005 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 14005 can be moved automatically by an actuator. FIG. 141 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 141 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 14104 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14103 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14103 is at a selected location on a person's forehead and/or temple from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14107. The upper half of FIG. 141 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 14104 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14103 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14103 is not at this selected location. In an example, the selected location from which an electromagnetic energy sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 141 comprises: face-spanning support member 14101, two optical members (including optical member 14102), electromagnetic energy sensor 14103, moveable sensor arm 14104, and connectors 14105 and 14106. Connectors 14105 and 14106 connect moveable sensor arm 14104 with face-spanning support member 14101. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 14101 is a single-piece member which spans from one ear to the other. In this example, face-spanning support member 14101 has two side portions (which each span from an ear to the front of the face) and a front portion (which spans the face from one side to the other). Although the far side portion is not shown [sorry, Gary] in the angled perspective of FIG. 141, the device in this example is assumed to be symmetric with respect to a central longitudinal (right-vs.-left) plane of the person's head. In this example, side portions are horizontally aligned with the person's eyes and the front portion is horizontally aligned with the person's eyebrows in the second arm configuration. In this example, the two optical members (including 14102) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 14101 and the two optical members (including 14102) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 14103 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14107 is on a person's forehead and/or temple. As shown in FIG. 141, moveable sensor arm 14104 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14107 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 141, moveable sensor arm 14104 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is substantially hidden behind, aligned with, and interior to face-spanning support member 14101. In this example, in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14104 is substantially aligned with, hidden behind, and interior to face-spanning support member 14101. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14104 is bent, flexed, and/or folded upwards from face-spanning support member 14101 when the distance between connectors 14105 and 14106 is decreased. In this example, the distance between connectors 14105 and 14106 is decreased when connector 14106 is moved toward connector 14105. In an example, this movement can be along a track and/or channel in face-spanning support member 14101. In another example, connector 14105 can be moved toward connector 14106. In another example, both connectors 14105 and 14106 can be moved toward each other. In this example, when moveable sensor arm 14104 is bent, flexed, and/or folded upwards into the first arm configuration, it moves electromagnetic energy sensor 14103 to a selected location on the person's temple and/or forehead from which this sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14107. In this example, connector 14105 is located near the front end of a side portion of face-spanning support member 14101. In this example, connector 14106 is located near the rear end of a side portion of face-spanning support member 14101 in the second arm configuration and near the middle of the side portion of face-spanning support member 14101 is the first arm configuration. In an example, the device can be symmetric and there can be a similar moveable sensor arm and similar connectors on the other side of the person's head which are not shown from this perspective. In an example, the device can be asymmetric and there can be only one moveable sensor arm on only one side of the person's head. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14104 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 14104 can be moved automatically by an actuator. FIG. 142 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 142 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 14204 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14203 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14203 is at a selected location on a person's forehead from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14207. In an example, this selected location can be a body surface location which is proximal to the person's pineal gland; in an example, this device can be useful for an astro teller. The upper half of FIG. 142 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 14204 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14203 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14203 is not at the selected location. In an example, the selected location from which an electromagnetic energy sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 142 comprises: face-spanning support member 14201, two optical members (including optical member 14202), electromagnetic energy sensor 14203, moveable sensor arm 14204, and connectors 14205 and 14206. Connectors 14205 and 14206 connect moveable sensor arm 14204 to face-spanning support member 14201. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 14201 is a single-piece member which spans from one ear to the other. In this example, face-spanning support member 14201 has two side portions (which each span from an ear to the front of the face) and a front portion (which spans the face from one side to the other). Although the far side portion is not shown in the angled perspective of FIG. 142, the device in this example is assumed to be symmetric with respect to a central longitudinal (right-vs.-left) plane of the person's head. In this example, side portions are horizontally aligned with the person's eyes and the front portion is horizontally aligned with the person's eyebrows in the second arm configuration. In this example, the two optical members (including 14202) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 14201 and the two optical members (including 14202) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 14203 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14207 is on a person's forehead. As shown in FIG. 142, moveable sensor arm 14204 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14207 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 142, moveable sensor arm 14204 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is substantially hidden behind, aligned with, and interior to face-spanning support member 14201. In this example, in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14204 is substantially aligned with, hidden behind, and interior to face-spanning support member 14201. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14204 is bent, flexed, and/or folded upwards from face-spanning support member 14201 when the distance between connectors 14205 and 14206 is decreased. In this example, the distance between connectors 14205 and 14206 is decreased when connectors 14205 and 14206 are moved toward each other. In an example, this movement can be along a track and/or channel in face-spanning support member 14201. In other examples, only connector 14205 can be moved toward connector 14206 or only connector 14206 can be moved toward connector 14205. In this example, when moveable sensor arm 14204 is bent, flexed, and/or folded upwards into the first arm configuration, it moves electromagnetic energy sensor 14203 to a selected location on the person's forehead from which this sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14207. In this example, connectors 14205 and 14206 are located along the front portion of face-spanning support member 14201. In this example, there is one central moveable sensor arm and one central electromagnetic energy sensor. In another example, there can be two moveable sensor arms and two electromagnetic energy sensors, one on each side of the forehead and/or one above each of the two optical members. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14204 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 14204 can be moved automatically by an actuator. FIG. 143 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 143 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 14304 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14303 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14303 is at a selected location on a person's forehead from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14305. The upper half of FIG. 143 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 14304 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14303 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14303 is not at the selected location. In an example, the selected location from which an electromagnetic energy sensor collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 143 comprises: face-spanning support member 14301, two optical members (including optical member 14302), electromagnetic energy sensor 14303, and moveable sensor arm 14304. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 14301 is a single-piece member which spans the circumference of a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, face-spanning support member 14301 can have a longitudinal axis which encircles a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, when a person is standing up, a plane formed by this longitudinal axis can intersect a horizontal plane at an angle which is less than 45 degrees. In this example, face-spanning support member 14301 spans a person's face at a horizontal level which is substantially aligned with the person's eyebrows. In another example, face-spanning support member 14301 can span a person's face across the person's forehead. In this example, face-spanning support member 14301 spans the sides of the person's head at levels which are proximal to the upper portions of the person's ears. In another example, a face-spanning support member can be a single-piece member which spans a portion of the circumference of a person's head. In an example, a face-spanning support member can span from one ear to the other ear in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, face-spanning support member can have a longitudinal axis which spans a portion of a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, when a person is standing up, a plane formed by this longitudinal axis can intersect a horizontal plane at an angle which is less than 45 degrees. In this example, face-spanning support member can span a person's face at a horizontal level which is substantially aligned with the person's eyebrows. In another example, a face-spanning support member can span a person's face across the person's forehead. In this example, a face-spanning support member can span the sides of a person's head at levels which are proximal to the upper portions of the person's ears. In this example, two optical members (including 14302) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 14301 and the two optical members (including 14302) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 14303 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14305 is on a person's forehead. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14304 can be moved along the longitudinal axis of face-spanning support member 14301 from a first arm configuration to a second arm configuration, and vice versa. In an example, moveable sensor arm 14304 can slide along a track and/or channel on face-spanning support member 14301. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14304 is located on a person's forehead in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure) and is located on the side or back of the person's head in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure). In this example, there is one moveable sensor arm and one central electromagnetic energy sensor. In another example, there can be a plurality of moveable sensor arms and electromagnetic energy sensors. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14304 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 14304 can be moved automatically by an actuator. As shown in FIG. 143, moveable sensor arm 14304 is visually less-obtrusive (from a frontal perspective) in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14305 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. In FIG. 143, moveable sensor arm 14304 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration because it is less visible from the perspective of someone facing the person. FIG. 144 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 144 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 14405 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensors 14403 and 14404 are in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensors 14403 and 14404 are at selected locations on a person's head from which they collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14407 and 14408. The upper half of FIG. 144 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 14405 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensors 14403 and 14404 are in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensors 14403 and 14404 are not at these selected locations. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 144 comprises: face-spanning support member 14401, two optical members (including optical member 14402), electromagnetic energy sensors 14403 and 14404, moveable sensor arm 14405, and connecting axles (including 14406). Connecting axle 14406 connects moveable sensor arm 14405 with face-spanning support member 14401. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 14401 is a single-piece member which spans the circumference of a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, face-spanning support member 14401 can have a longitudinal axis which encircles a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, when a person is standing up, a plane formed by this longitudinal axis can intersect a horizontal plane at an angle which is less than 45 degrees. In this example, face-spanning support member 14401 spans a person's face at a horizontal level which is substantially aligned with the person's eyebrows. In another example, face-spanning support member 14401 can span a person's face across the person's forehead. In this example, face-spanning support member 14401 spans the sides of the person's head at levels which are proximal to the upper portions of the person's ears. In another example, a face-spanning support member can be a single-piece member which spans a portion of the circumference of a person's head. In an example, a face-spanning support member can span from one ear to the other ear in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, face-spanning support member can have a longitudinal axis which spans a portion of a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, when a person is standing up, a plane formed by this longitudinal axis can intersect a horizontal plane at an angle which is less than 45 degrees. In this example, face-spanning support member can span a person's face at a horizontal level which is substantially aligned with the person's eyebrows. In another example, a face-spanning support member can span a person's face across the person's forehead. In this example, a face-spanning support member can span the sides of a person's head at levels which are proximal to the upper portions of the person's ears. In this example, two optical members (including 14402) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 14401 and the two optical members (including 14402) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected locations from which electromagnetic energy sensors 14403 and 14404 collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14407 and 14408 are on the sides and back of a person's head. In an example, the selected locations from which electromagnetic energy sensors 14403 and 14404 collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14405 pivots and/or rotates around axle 14406 in order to change from the second arm configuration to the first arm configuration, or vice versa. Although not shown, in this example a similar axle is assumed to be on the other side of the person's head due to assumed device symmetry. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14405 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 14405 can be moved automatically by an actuator. In this example, in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14405 is substantially aligned with, hidden behind, and interior to face-spanning support member 14401. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14405 is attached the face-spanning support member 14401 via axle 14406 which is located near the side of the person's face. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14405 spans backward from axle 14406 to loop around the back of the person's head. In this example, in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure) the rear portion of moveable sensor arm 14405 has been pivoted and/or rotated upwards to loop around the back of the person's head at a higher level. In an example, electromagnetic energy sensors 14403 and 14404 can measure electromagnetic brain activity 14407 and 14408 better from this higher level. As shown in FIG. 144, moveable sensor arm 14405 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14407 and 14408 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. FIG. 145 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 145 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 14504 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14503 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14503 is at a selected location on a person's forehead and/or temple from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14507. The upper half of FIG. 145 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 14504 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14503 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14503 is not at the selected location. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 145 comprises: face-spanning support member 14501, two optical members (including optical member 14502), electromagnetic energy sensor 14503, an first portion of moveable sensor arm 14504, a second portion of moveable sensor arm 14505, and connecting axle 14506. Connecting axle 14506 connects the moveable sensor arm (14504 and 14505) to face-spanning support member 14501. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 14501 is a single-piece member which spans the circumference of a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, face-spanning support member 14501 can have a longitudinal axis which encircles a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, when a person is standing up, a plane formed by this longitudinal axis can intersect a horizontal plane at an angle which is less than 45 degrees. In this example, face-spanning support member 14501 spans a person's face at a horizontal level which is substantially aligned with the person's eyebrows. In another example, face-spanning support member 14501 can span a person's face across the person's forehead. In this example, face-spanning support member 14501 spans the sides of the person's head at levels which are proximal to the upper portions of the person's ears. In another example, a face-spanning support member can be a single-piece member which spans a portion of the circumference of a person's head. In an example, a face-spanning support member can span from one ear to the other ear in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, face-spanning support member can have a longitudinal axis which spans a portion of a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, when a person is standing up, a plane formed by this longitudinal axis can intersect a horizontal plane at an angle which is less than 45 degrees. In an example, a face-spanning support member can span a person's face at a horizontal level which is substantially aligned with the person's eyebrows. In another example, a face-spanning support member can span a person's face across the person's forehead. In this example, a face-spanning support member can span the sides of a person's head at levels which are proximal to the upper portions of the person's ears. In this example, two optical members (including 14502) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 14501 and the two optical members (including 14502) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 14503 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14507 is on a person's temple and/or forehead. In an example, the selected locations from which electromagnetic energy sensor 14503 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In this example, the moveable sensor arm (14504 and 14505) rotates around axle 14506 in order to change from the second arm configuration to the first arm configuration, or vice versa. Although not shown from this perspective, in this example there can be a similar moveable arm on the other side of the person's head. In this example, the moveable sensor arm (14504 and 14505) is moved manually. In another example, the moveable sensor arm can be moved automatically by an actuator. In this example, in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) the moveable sensor arm (14504 and 14505) is substantially aligned with (and partially hidden behind) face-spanning support member 14501. In this example, the moveable sensor arm (14504 and 14505) is attached to face-spanning support member 14501 via axle 14506 which is located on the side of the person's face. In this example, in the second arm configuration, the first part 14504 of the moveable sensor arm spans forward from axle 14506 (on the interior side of face-spanning support member 14501) and the second part 14505 of the moveable sensor arm spans backward from axle 14506 (on the exterior side of face-spanning support member 14501). In this example, in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure) the forward spanning portion has been pivoted and/or rotated upwards to bring electromagnetic energy sensor 14503 into contact with the person's temple and/or forehead. As shown in FIG. 145, the moveable sensor arm (14504 and 14505) is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14507 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. FIG. 146 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 146 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 14604 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14603 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14603 is at a selected location on a person's forehead from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14606. The upper half of FIG. 146 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 14604 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14603 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14603 is not at the selected location. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 146 comprises: face-spanning support member 14601, two optical members (including optical member 14602), electromagnetic energy sensor 14603, moveable sensor arm 14604, and connecting axles (including 14605). Connecting axle 14605 connects moveable sensor arm 14604 to face-spanning support member 14601. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 14601 is a single-piece member which spans a portion of the circumference of a person's head. In this example, face-spanning support member 14601 spans from one ear to the other ear in a substantially-horizontal manner. In this example, face-spanning support member 14601 has a longitudinal axis which spans a portion of a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, when a person is standing up, a plane formed by this longitudinal axis intersects a horizontal plane at an angle which is less than 45 degrees. In this example, face-spanning support member 14601 spans a person's face at a horizontal level which is substantially aligned with the person's eyebrows. In another example, a face-spanning support member can span a person's face across the person's forehead. In this example, face-spanning support member 14601 spans the sides of a person's head at levels which are proximal to the upper portions of the person's ears. In this example, two optical members (including 14602) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 14601 and the two optical members (including 14602) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 14603 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14604 pivots and/or rotates around axle 14605 in order to change from the second arm configuration to the first arm configuration, or vice versa. Although not shown, in this example a similar axle is assumed to be on the other side of the person's head due to assumed device symmetry. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14604 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 14604 can be moved automatically by an actuator. In this example, in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14604 spans backwards from axle 14605 and loops around the back of the person's head (in a manner which is relatively unobtrusive from the perspective of someone facing the person). In this example, moveable sensor arm 14604 is attached to face-spanning support member 14601 via axle 14605 which is located near the person's ear. In this example, in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14604 has been pivoted and/or rotated over the top of the person's head in order to bring electromagnetic energy sensor 14603 into contact with the person's forehead. In an example, there can be multiple electromagnetic energy sensors on moveable sensor arm 14604. As shown in FIG. 146, moveable sensor arm 14604 is visually less-obtrusive (from a frontal perspective) in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14606 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. FIG. 147 shows an example of how this invention can be embodied in a shape-transforming eyewear device for collecting data concerning electromagnetic brain activity comprising: a face-spanning support member which is configured to span an upper portion of a person's face; at least one optical member which transmits light from the person's environment and/or light from a virtual image display to at least one of the person's eyes; one or more electromagnetic energy sensors, wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a first sensor configuration wherein they are configured to be at a selected locations relative to the surface of the person's head in order to collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity and wherein these electromagnetic energy sensors have a second sensor configuration wherein they are not at these selected locations; and a movable sensor arm which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors and is at least partially connected to the face-spanning support member, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a first arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the first sensor configuration, wherein this moveable sensor arm has a second arm configuration which holds the electromagnetic energy sensors in the second sensor configuration, and wherein this moveable sensor arm is moved relative to the face-spanning support member in order to change from the first arm configuration to the second arm configuration, or vice versa. The lower half of FIG. 147 shows this example at a time when moveable sensor arm 14704 is in the first arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14703 is in the first sensor configuration. In this first configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14703 is at a selected location on a person's forehead from which it collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14706. The upper half of FIG. 147 shows this example at different time, when moveable sensor arm 14704 is in the second arm configuration and electromagnetic energy sensor 14703 is in the second sensor configuration. In this second configuration, electromagnetic energy sensor 14703 is not at the selected location. In more detail, the embodiment shown in FIG. 147 comprises: face-spanning support member 14701, two optical members (including optical member 14702), electromagnetic energy sensor 14703, moveable sensor arm 14704, and connecting axles (including 14705). Connecting axle 14705 connects moveable sensor arm 14704 to face-spanning support member 14701. As discussed earlier, this embodiment can further comprise one or more components selected from the group consisting of: data processor, power source, data communication component, human-to-computer user interface, computer-to-human interface, digital memory, additional sensors, and a non-implantable electromagnetic energy emitter. In this example, face-spanning support member 14701 is a single-piece member which spans a portion of the circumference of a person's head. In this example, face-spanning support member 14701 spans from one ear to the other ear in a substantially-horizontal manner. In this example, face-spanning support member 14701 has a longitudinal axis which spans a portion of a person's head in a substantially-horizontal manner. In an example, when a person is standing up, a plane formed by this longitudinal axis intersects a horizontal plane at an angle which is less than 45 degrees. In this example, face-spanning support member 14701 spans a person's face at a horizontal level which is substantially aligned with the person's eyebrows. In another example, a face-spanning support member can span a person's face across the person's forehead. In this example, face-spanning support member 14701 spans the sides of a person's head at levels which are proximal to the upper portions of the person's ears. In this example, two optical members (including 14702) are lenses. In this example, face-spanning support member 14701 and the two optical members (including 14702) together comprise a pair of electronically-functional eyeglasses. In this example, the selected location from which electromagnetic energy sensor 14703 collects data concerning electromagnetic brain activity can be selected from the group consisting of: FP1, FPz, FP2, AF7, AF5, AF3, AFz, AF4, AF6, AF8, F7, F5, F3, F1, Fz, F2, F4, F6, F8, FT7, FC5, FC3, FC1, FCz, FC2, FC4, FC6, FT8, T3/T7, C3, C4, C1, Cz, C2, C5, C6, T4/T8, TP7, CP5, CP3, CP1, CPz, CP2, CP4, CP6, TP8, T5/P7, P5, P3, P1, Pz, P2, P4, P6, T6/P8, PO7, PO5, PO3, POz, PO4, PO6, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14704 rotates and/or pivots around axle 14705 in order to change from the second arm configuration to the first arm configuration, or vice versa. Although not shown, in this example a similar axle is assumed to be on the other side of the person's head due to assumed device symmetry. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14704 is moved manually. In another example, moveable sensor arm 14704 can be moved automatically by an actuator. In this example, in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14704 spans the circumference of the person's head in a substantially horizontal manner. In this example, as moveable sensor arm 14704 spans the person's face, it is substantially aligned with, hidden by, and interior to the front portion of face-spanning support member 14701. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14704 also loops around the back of the person's head. In this example, moveable sensor arm 14704 is attached to face-spanning support member 14701 via axle 14705 which is located near the person's ear. In this example, in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure) moveable sensor arm 14704 has been pivoted and/or rotated in order to bring electromagnetic energy sensor 14703 into contact with the person's forehead. In an example, there can be multiple electromagnetic energy sensors on moveable sensor arm 14704. As shown in FIG. 147, moveable sensor arm 14704 is visually less-obtrusive in the second arm configuration (shown in the upper half of the figure) than in the first arm configuration (shown in the lower half of the figure). Thus, this eyewear can collect data concerning electromagnetic brain activity 14706 using a more-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is needed, but can transform into a less-obtrusive configuration at times when such data collection is not needed. This enables a person to wear a mobile EEG monitor without looking too dorky—or at least without looking dorky all the time. FIGS. 148 through 155 show examples of an eyewear device which collects data concerning electromagnetic energy from a person's brain. FIG. 148 shows an example of an eyewear device which collects data concerning electromagnetic energy from a person's brain comprising: a frontal support member 14801 which is configured to be worn on a person's head and to span from one eye to the other eye across a portion of the front of the person's face; at least one optical member 14802 which is configured to be worn within 6″ of one of the person's eyes and which is attached to or an integrated part of the frontal support member 14801; at least one lateral ear support member 14803 which is attached to or an integrated part of the frontal support member 14801 and which is configured to be worn on or around one of the person's ears; at least one forehead ascending member 14804 which is attached to or an integrated part of the lateral ear support member 14803 which is configured to span at least a portion of the person's temple and/or forehead above the lateral ear support member 14803; at least one electromagnetic energy sensor 14807 and/or 14808 which is attached to or an integrated part of the forehead ascending member 14804 and which is configured to receive electromagnetic energy from the person's brain; and a control unit 14805 with which the at least one electromagnetic energy sensor 14807 and/or 14808 is in electromagnetic communication. The example in FIG. 148 also shows a reference electrode 14806 which is in electromagnetic communication with the person's head in proximity to the person's ear. In an example, the device shown in FIG. 148 can be symmetric with respect to the sides of the person's head, with similar, symmetric components assumed on both the right and left sides of the person's head, even though only the left side of the person's head is fully shown in FIG. 148. In an example, some of the components may not be symmetric with respect to the right and left sides of the person's head. In an example, there can be a forehead ascending member (and associated electromagnetic sensors) on both sides of the person's head. In an example, there can be a forehead ascending member (and associated electromagnetic sensors) only on one side of the person's head. In an example, a frontal support member can longitudinally and horizontally span a portion of the person's face within 1″ of the person's eyebrows. In an example, a frontal support member can be straight. In an example, a frontal support member can be arcuate. In an example, a frontal support member (or projections from it) can rest on the bridge of the person's nose. In an example, a frontal support member can be the front portion of the frame of a pair of eyeglasses. In an example, an optical member can be an optical lens which modifies light rays from an object in the environment before these light rays are received by an eye. In an example, an optical member can be a convex or concave lens. In an example, an optical member can be an image-displaying member which creates a virtual image which is seen by an eye. In an example, an optical member can be a display screen. In an example, an optical member can be a composite optical member which allows light rays from an object in the environment to reach an eye and also creates a virtual image which is seen by the eye. In an example, an optical member can be part of a virtual reality or augmented reality system. In an example, at least one lateral ear support member can be connected to a frontal support member by a hinge and/or spring mechanism. In an example, at least one lateral ear support member can be an integrated part (one continuous piece) of the frontal support member. In an example, a lateral ear support member can be an ear piece or side frame of a pair of eyeglasses. In an example, a lateral ear support member can be straight. In an example, a lateral ear support member can be arcuate. In an example, a distal end of a lateral ear support member can rest on top of a person's ear. In an example, a distal end of lateral ear support member can curve around a person's ear. In an example, a forehead ascending member can be attached to (and/or branch off from) a lateral ear support member at a location in a middle section of the lateral ear support member. In an example, a forehead ascending member can be attached to (and/or branch off from) a lateral ear support member at a location in the middle section of the lateral ear support member which at least ½ inch from the frontal support member. In an example, a forehead ascending member can be attached to (and/or branch off from) a lateral ear support member at a location in a middle section of the lateral ear support member which at least ½ inch from the distal end of the lateral ear support member. In an example, a forehead ascending member can be attached to (and/or branch off from) a lateral ear support member at a location in a middle section of the lateral ear support member which at least ½ inch from the top of the person's ear. In an example, a forehead ascending member can span a distance between ¼ inch and 6 inches. In an example, a forehead ascending member can be arcuate. In an example, a forehead ascending member can have an arcuate shape which branches off from the lateral ear support member at an acute angle (X), diverges from the lateral ear support member at a growing angle (Y, which is greater than X), and then further diverges at a shrinking angle (Z, which is less than X). In an example, a forehead ascending member can have an arcuate shape which comprises a portion of a sine curve. In an example, a forehead ascending member can have an arcuate shape which is a conic section. In an example, a forehead ascending member can branch off from a lateral ear support member and ascend to a person's temple. In an example, a forehead ascending member can branch off from a lateral ear support member and ascend to a location on a person's forehead which is directly above the person's eye. In an example, a forehead ascending member can branch off from a lateral ear support member and ascend to the center of the person's forehead. In an example a forehead ascending member can ascend to a location on a person's forehead which is between ¼″ and 4″ above the person's eyebrows. In an example, a forehead ascending member can have a lower end which branches off from the lateral ear support member and an upper end which is located over the person's temple or forehead, wherein projecting and plotting the locations of the lower and upper ends onto a vertical plane yields a linear approximation of the slope of the forehead ascending member in the range of 0.5 to 2. In an example, a forehead ascending member can have a lower end which branches off from the lateral ear support member and an upper end which is located over the person's temple or forehead, wherein projecting and plotting the locations of the lower and upper ends onto a vertical plane yields a linear approximation of the upward angle of the forehead ascending member in the range of 30 degrees to 150 degrees. In an example, a forehead ascending member can travel along an inward (closer to the face) as well as an upward (closer to the top of the head) path after branching off from a lateral ear support member. In an example, a forehead ascending member can have a spring mechanism which keeps it close to (and/or exerts pressure on) the surface of the person's head. In an example, a forehead ascending member can further comprise an inflatable member which keeps it close to (and/or exerts pressure on) the surface of the person's head. In an example, a forehead ascending member can have a motion mechanism which helps to keep it close to (and/or exerts pressure on) the surface of the person's head. In an example this motion mechanism can be selected from the group consisting of: electric motor or actuator; MEMS; pneumatic member; hydraulic member; spring; and other tensile member. In an example, an electromagnetic energy sensor can be an electroencephalographic (EEG) sensor. In an example, data collected by an electromagnetic energy sensor can be used to measure electromagnetic energy emitted by a person's brain. In an example, data collected by electromagnetic energy sensors can be used to measure a person's brain waves. In an example, data from the sensors can be analyzed using Fourier Transformation to identify wave patterns at different frequencies or within selected frequency ranges. In an example, the relative power of brain waves in different frequency ranges can be tracked and analyzed. In an example, an electromagnetic energy sensor can be a dry EEG sensor which does not require gel or liquid to make electromagnetic contact with a person's brain. In an example, an electromagnetic energy sensor can be in direct physical contact with the person's skin. In an example, an electromagnetic energy sensor can be in electromagnetic communication with the person's brain without being in direct physical contact with the person's skin. In an example, there can be two electromagnetic energy sensors on one forehead ascending member, one closer to the person's ear and one further up toward the center of the person's forehead. In an example, there can be only one electromagnetic energy sensor on a forehead ascending member. In an example, there can be three or more electromagnetic energy sensors on a forehead ascending member. In an example, a control unit can further comprise a power source, a data processing unit, a human-to-computer control interface, a computer-to-human interface, and a wireless data transmitter. In an example, one or more electromagnetic energy sensors can be in electromagnetic communication with the control unit. In an example, data from one or more electromagnetic energy sensors can be analyzed within a data processing unit within the control unit. In an example, data from one or more electromagnetic energy sensors can be wirelessly transmitted to a remote data processing unit and analyzed within that remote data processing unit. In an example, a power source can be a battery. In an example, a power source can further comprise an energy harvesting member which transduces kinetic, thermal, and/or ambient electromagnetic energy into power for the device. In an example, a human-to-computer control interface can be selected from the group consisting of: voice or speech recognition; a button or other touch-based control; and gesture recognition. In an example, data from the electromagnetic energy sensors themselves can be analyzed and used as part of the human-to-computer control interface for the device. FIG. 149 shows another example of an eyewear device to collect data concerning electromagnetic energy from a person's brain.
