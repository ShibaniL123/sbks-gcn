RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/634,144, filed on Aug. 4, 2003, filed, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 60/400,875, filed on Aug. 2, 2002, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Liposomes and lipid complexes have been long recognized as drug delivery systems which can improve therapeutic and diagnostic effectiveness of many bioactive agents and contrast agents. Experiments with a number of different antibiotics and X-ray contrast agents have shown that better therapeutic activity or better contrast with a higher level of safety can be achieved by encapsulating bioactive agents and contrast agents with liposomes or lipid complexes. Research on liposomes and lipid complexes as encapsulating systems for bioactive agents has revealed that a successful development and commercialization of such products requires reproducible methods of large scale production of lipid vesicles with suitable characteristics. Consequently, workers have searched for methods which consistently produce liposomes or lipid complexes of the required size and concentration, size distribution and, importantly, entrapping capacity, with flexible lipid composition requirements. Such methods seek to provide liposomes or lipid complexes with consistent active substance to lipid ratio while respecting currently accepted good manufacturing practices for pharmaceutical products. Conventional liposome and lipid complex preparation methods include a number of steps in which the bilayer-forming components (for example, phospholipids or mixtures of phospholipids with other lipids e.g., cholesterol) are dissolved in a volatile organic solvent or solvent mixture in a round bottom flask followed by evaporation of the solvent under conditions, such as temperature and pressure, which will prevent phase separation. Upon solvent removal a dry lipid mixture, usually in form of a film deposit on the walls of the reactor, is hydrated with an aqueous medium which may contain dissolved buffers, salts, conditioning agents and an active substance to be entrapped. Liposomes or lipid complexes form in the hydration step such that a proportion of the aqueous medium becomes encapsulated in the liposomes. The hydration can be performed with or without energizing the solution by means of stirring, sonication or microfluidization or with subsequent extrusion through one or more filters, such as polycarbonate filters. The free non-encapsulated active substance can be separated for recovery and the product is filtered, sterilized, optionally lyophilized, and packaged. Other methods of making liposomes or lipid complexes involving injection of organic solutions of lipids into an aqueous medium with continuous removal of solvent, use of spray drying, lyophilization, microemulsification and microfluidization, and the like have been proposed in a number of publications or patents. Such patents include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,529,561 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,572,425. Cisplatin—cis-diamine-dichloroplatinum (II)—is one of the more effective anti-tumor agents used in the systemic treatment of cancers. This chemotherapeutic drug is highly effective in the treatment of tumor models in laboratory animals and in human tumors, such as endometrial, bladder, ovarian and testicular neoplasms, as well as squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Sur, et al., 1983 Oncology 40(5): 372-376; Steerenberg, et al., 1988 Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 21(4): 299-307). Cisplatin is also used extensively in the treatment of lung carcinoma, both small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (Schiller et al., 2001 Oncology 61(Suppl 1): 3-13). Other active platinum compounds (defined below) are useful in cancer treatment. Like other cancer chemotherapeutic agents, active platinum compounds such as cisplatin are typically highly toxic. The main disadvantages of cisplatin are its extreme nephrotoxicity, which is the main dose-limiting factor, its rapid excretion via the kidneys, with a circulation half life of only a few minutes, and its strong affinity to plasma proteins (Freise, et al., 1982 Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther. 258(2): 180-192). Attempts to minimize the toxicity of active platinum compounds have included combination chemotherapy, synthesis of analogues (Prestayko et al., 1979 Cancer Treat Rev. 6(1): 17-39; Weiss, et al., 1993 Drugs. 46(3): 360-377), immunotherapy and entrapment in liposomes (Sur, et al., 1983; Weiss, et al., 1993). It has been reported that antineoplastic agents, including cisplatin, entrapped in liposomes have a reduced toxicity, relative to the agent in free form, while retaining antitumor activity (Steerenberg, et al., 1987; Weiss, et al., 1993). Cisplatin, however, is difficult to efficiently entrap in liposomes or lipid complexes because of its low aqueous solubility, approximately 1.0 mg/mL at room temperature, and low lipophilicity, both of which properties contribute to a low cisplatin/lipid ratio. Liposomes and lipid complexes containing cisplatin suffer from another problem—stability of the composition. In particular, maintenance of bioactive agent potency and retention of the bioactive agent in the liposome during storage are recognized problems (Freise, et al., 1982; Gondal, et al., 1993; Potkul, et al., 1991 Am J Obstet Gynecol. 164(2): 652-658; Steerenberg, et al., 1988; Weiss, et al., 1993) and a limited shelf life of liposomes containing cisplatin, on the order of several weeks at 4° C., has been reported (Gondal, et al., 1993 Eur J. Cancer. 29A(1): 1536-1542; Potkul, et al., 1991). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided, among other things, is a new form of lipid-complexed active platinum compound, which allows for high concentrations of platinum compound in a composition. For example, the concentration of cisplatin in the composition is higher at room temperature, e.g., about greater than 1.2 mg/mL, compared to 1 mg/mL in aqueous solution. The lipid-complexed active platinum compound is stable over long periods of time. For example, the lipid-complexed active platinum compound is stable for more than one year.

In some embodiments, wherein lipid-complexed active platinum compound has an average volume-weighted diameter of about 0.5 to about 20 microns. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises a liposome. The liposome may comprise at least one lipid, and may further comprise at least one active platinum compound. In some embodiments, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a lipid complexed active platinum compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The pharmaceutical formulation may be formulated for inhalation or injection.

Another aspect of the invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations comprising any one of the aforementioned compositions and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The pharmaceutical formulation of the lipid complexed active platinum compound may be comprised of an aqueous dispersion of liposomes. The formulation may contain lipid excipients to form the liposomes, and salts/buffers to provide the appropriate osmolarity and pH. The pharmaceutical excipient may be a liquid, diluent, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting any subject composition or component thereof from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each excipient must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the subject composition and its components and not injurious to the patient. Suitable excipients include trehalose, raffinose, mannitol, sucrose, leucine, trileucine, and calcium chloride. Examples of other suitable excipients include (1) sugars, such as lactose, and glucose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; and (21) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is adapted for inhalation by or injection into a patient. The process for producing this active platinum compound formulation can comprise mixing an active platinum compound with an appropriate hydrophobic matrix and subjecting the mixture to one or more cycles of establishing two separate temperatures. For example, the process comprises the steps of: (a) combining an active platinum compound and a hydrophobic matrix carrying system; (b) establishing the mixture at a first temperature; and (c) thereafter establishing the mixture at a second temperature, which second temperature is cooler than the first temperature. Step (b) is typically effected with heating, while step (c) is typically effected with cooling. In alternative embodiments, the cycles are counted beginning with the cooler step, transitioning to the warmer step, and cycling the two steps. The process can comprise sequentially repeating the steps (b) and (c) for a total of two or three or more cycles. The active platinum compound solution can be produced by dissolving active platinum compound in a saline solution to form a platinum solution. The hydrophobic matrix carrying system favorably comprises liposome or lipid complex-forming lipids. The process for making a platinum aggregate can further comprise, after all of steps (b) and steps (c) have been completed: (d) removing un-entrapped active platinum compound by filtering through a membrane having a molecular weight cut-off selected to retain desired liposomes or lipid complexes and adding a liposome or lipid complex compatible liquid to wash out un-entrapped active platinum compound. Cisplatin, for example, forms large crystalline aggregates in aqueous solution with a crystal diameter of greater than a few microns. In the presence of an amphipathic matrix system, such as a lipid bilayer, small cisplatin aggregates form. For example, the aggregates may be formed in the hydrocarbon core region of a lipid bilayer or be formed such that a lipid bilayer surrounds the aggregate. During the warming cycle of the process, it is believed that cisplatin is returned to solution at a greater rate in aqueous regions of the process mixture than in the bilayers. As a result of applying more than one cool/warm cycle, cisplatin accumulates further in the core region of the lipid bilayers or within the lipid bilayer. Without limiting the invention to the proposed theory, experimentation indicates that the cisplatin aggregates cause the immediate surroundings of the interfacial bilayer region to be more hydrophobic and compact. This results in a high level of entrapment of active platinum compound as cooling and warming cycles are repeated. The resulting formulation has a markedly high entrapment percentage. The entrapment has been shown, in some cases, to reach almost 92%. This amount is far higher than the most efficient entrapment expected from a conventional aqueous entrapment which is approximately 2-10% entrapment. This efficiency of the present invention is demonstrated in example 3. In one embodiment, the process comprises combining the bioactive agent with a hydrophobic matrix carrying system and cycling the solution between a warmer and a cooler temperature. Preferably the cycling is performed more than one time. More preferably the step is performed two or more times, or three or more times. The cooler temperature portion of cycle can, for example, use a temperature of about 35° C. or less, 25° C. or less, 20° C. or less, 15° C. or less, 10° C. or less, or 5° C. or less. In some embodiments, the temperature is about −25° Celsius to about 35° Celsius, about −5 to about 25° C., about −5 and about 20° C., about −5 and about 10° C., about −5 and about 5° C., or about 1 and about 5° C. In some embodiments, the warming step temperature is 50° Celsius or higher. The temperatures can also be selected to be below and above the transition temperature for a lipid in the lipid composition. In some embodiments the step of warming comprises warming the reaction vessel to about 4 to about 70° Celsius, about 45 and to about 55° Celsius. The above temperature ranges are particularly preferred for use with lipid compositions comprising predominantly diphosphatidycholine (DPPC) and cholesterol. For manufacturing convenience, and to be sure the desired temperature is established, the cooler and warmer steps can be maintained for a period of time, such as approximately form 5 to 300 minutes or 30 to 60 minutes. Another way to consider the temperature cycling is in terms of the temperature differential between the warming and cooling steps of the cycle. This temperature differential can be, for example, about 25° Celsius or more, such as a differential from about 25 to about 70° Celsius, or a differential of about 40 to about 55° Celsius. The temperatures of the warming and cooling steps are selected on the basis of increasing entrapment of active platinum compound. Without being limited by any particular theory, it is believed that it is useful to select an upper temperature effective substantially increase the solubility of active platinum compound in the process mixture. During repetitive cooling/heating, bioactive agents are solubilized and crystallized repetitively. As soluble drug is cooled, some portion enters complexes with the lipid while the remainder precipitates. On subsequent heating, unencapsulated bioactive agent that is crystallized becomes soluble again. Importantly, active platinum compound that has been encapsulated in the lipid complex substantially stays in the lipid complex during the heating and cooling cycling (e.g. it leaks at such a slow rate that no appreciable amount leaves the lipid complex during the heating phase of this process). For example, as the temperature is increased during the warming step of the cycle, the active platinum compound, such as cisplatin, dissolves. During the cooling step, the cisplatin in the aqueous phase precipitates out of solution to a greater extent that the cisplatin associated with the lipid bilayers, thereby increasing the amount of lipid-associated cisplatin with each heating and cooling cycle. Additionally, solubility of cisplatin is highly temperature-dependent. For example, FIG. 1A depicts a graph of the transition temperature of dissolved-precipitated cisplatin in aqueous solution as a function of cisplatin concentration during heating (where the cisplatin is initially in precipitated). FIG. 1C depicts a graph of the transition temperature at which aqueous cisplatin is precipitated during cooling (where the cisplatin is initially dissolved). Lowering 15° in temperature of a cisplatin solution decreases the soluble concentration by about 50%. In other words, solubility limiting concentration increases with increasing temperature by about 3% per degree increase in temperature of aqueous cisplatin. In addition, the aggregate (crystal)-to-monomer transition temperature (solubilizing temperature) is higher than the monomer-to-aggregate (crystal) transition temperature (crystallizing temperature) by about 15 to 20° C. Similar graphs for another active platinum compound, transplatin, are depicted in FIGS. 1B and 1D, which show solubility properties similar to cisplatin. Transplatin solubility is poorer than cisplatin, but it is also temperature-dependent. Lowering the temperature by about 15° C. decreases the soluble concentration of transplatin by about 50%. The aggregate (crystal)-to-monomer transition temperature (solubilizing temperature) is higher than the monomer-to-aggregate (crystal) transition temperature (crystallizing temperature) by about 20 to 30° C. Experimental results strongly indicate that the physical state of cisplatin is solid (aggregates) or lipid bound since the concentration of cisplatin is much higher than the solubility limit. Results further indicate that process does not require freezing the compositions, but that cooling to temperature higher than the freezing point of water is effective. Results further indicated that an entrapment efficiency achieved by 3-cycles was similar to that achieved by 6-cycles of cooling and warming cycles, which indicated that 3 cycles of temperature treatment was sufficient to achieve high levels of active platinum compound entrapment. Results further indicate that the process can be scaled-up while increasing process efficiency in entrapping cisplatin. Thus, the invention further provides processes that are conducted to provide an amount adapted for total administration (in appropriate smaller volume increments) of 200 or more mLs, 400 or more mLs, or 800 or more mLs. All else being the same, it is believed that the larger production volumes generally achieve increased efficiency over smaller scale processes. While such volume is that appropriate for administration, it will be recognized that the volume can be reduced for storage. Results further indicate that the lipid-complexed cisplatin made by the method of the invention can retain entrapped cisplatin with minimal leakage for over one year. This is a further demonstration of the uniqueness in the formulation, indicating that the cisplatin is bound within the liposome structure and not free to readily leak out. The process of the present invention may further comprise separating the components of the product of the aforementioned process. For example, in some embodiments, the process provides both the aforementioned lipid-complexed active platinum compound and the aforementioned liposome. In certain embodiments, the portion of the product comprising the lipid-complexed active platinum compound, referred to herein as “the heavy fraction” may be separated from the portion comprising the liposome, referred to herein as “the light fraction.” Methods of separating include allowing the heavy product to settle over a period of time, or centrifuging the product. Example 1 70 mg DPPC and 28 mg cholesterol was dissolved in 1 mL ethanol and added to 10 mL of 4 mg/mL cisplatin in 0.9% saline solution. (i) An aliquot (50%) of the sample was treated by 3 cycles of cooling to 4° C. and warming to 50° C. The aliquot, in a test tube, was cooled by refrigeration, and heated in a water bath. The resulting unentrapped cisplatin (free cisplatin) was washed by dialysis. (ii) The remainder of the sample was not treated by temperature cycles and directly washed by dialysis.

The lipid/cisplatin suspension was cooled to approximately 4° C. and held at that temperature for 20 min. and warmed to 50° C. and held at that temperature for 20 min. Ethanol was removed by bubbling N2 gas into the suspension during the warming period. The cooling and warming steps were repeated 5 further times. TABLE 3 Entrapment of cisplatin.

[in-line-formulae]Vtotal=Vliposome+Voutside[/in-line-formulae] TABLE 6 [Measurement of Vliposome] Abs at 450 nm [dichromate] Voutside Vliposome HLL Cisplatin 0.874 0.67 mg/mL 1.88 mL 0.12 mL Saline only 0.822 0.60 mg/mL 2 mL 0 mL Method: 1) 2 mL HLL Cisplatin prepared as described in Example 4 was concentrated by centrifugation filter kit. 2) 0.8 mL of concentrated sample was recovered and 1.2 mL of 1 mg/mL dichromate was added to recover original volume. 0.8 mL normal saline+1.2 mL of dichromate was also prepared as a control. 3) Abs at 450 nm was measured to detect difference in dichromate concentration. To avoid turbidity from liposome sample, both samples were filtered by centrifugal filtration. Result: 6% of total volume was occupied by liposomes. Vliposome=1.53 μL/μmoles lipid (total lipid 39.3 mM) [in-line-formulae]Next, Vliposome=Vcaptured+Vbilayer [/in-line-formulae] To estimate Vbilayer, the lamellarity of the vesicles of HLL cisplatin was determined. Measurement of lamellarity of HLL cisplatin vesicles: % probe lipid at Ftotal Finside outmost leaflet* Fluorescence intensity 14193 11349 20 *% probe lipid at outmost leaflet = (Ftotal − Finside) × 100 ÷ Ftotal Method: Cisplatin vesicles were prepared with the method of Example 9, described below (1 liter batch) modified to add 0.5 wt % fluorescence probe lipid (NBD-PE). This probe lipid distributes evenly in membrane inside and outside. The ratio of amount of probes located in outmost membrane layer (surface of liposome) vs. the rest of probes is determined to estimate how many lipid layers exist in HLL Cisplatin. The ratio between probes located on liposome surface and probes located inside liposome was determined by adding a reducing agent dithionite to quench only surface probes. Then, total quenching was achieved by rupturing liposome with detergent. Result: Outmost bilayer shell contains 40% of total lipids. Based on geometric calculation, % lipid at outmost bilayer shell would be 52% and 36% for bi-lamellar and tri-lamellar vesicles, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the average lamellarity of HLL Cisplatin was three. Assuming tri-lamellar vesicles, the ratio of Vliposome/Vcaptured was calculated to be 1.2635. Therefore, the captured volume was: V captured = ⁢ V liposome ÷ 1.2635 = ⁢ 1.53 ⁢ ⁢ μ ⁢ ⁢ L ⁢ / ⁢ μ ⁢ ⁢ moles ⁢ ⁢ lipid ÷ 1.2635 = ⁢ 1.21 ⁢ ⁢ μ ⁢ ⁢ L ⁢ / ⁢ μ ⁢ ⁢ moles ⁢ ⁢ lipid = ⁢ 1.21 ⁢ ⁢ μ ⁢ ⁢ L ⁢ / ⁢ μ ⁢ ⁢ moles ⁢ ⁢ lipid × ⁢ 39.3 ⁢ ⁢ mM ⁢ ⁢ ( total ⁢ ⁢ lipid ⁢ ⁢ concentration ) = ⁢ 47.6 ⁢ ⁢ μ ⁢ ⁢ L ⁢ / ⁢ M ⁢ ⁢ 1 The captured volume was 47.6 μL per every mL HLL Cisplatin and 4.76% of total volume. If entrapped cisplatin was assumed to be in an aqueous compartment of liposomes, its local cisplatin concentration would be estimated to be 21.0 mg/mL. This concentration was not only higher than cisplatin solubility limit at room temperature but more significantly it was much higher than initial charging concentration (4 mg/mL). Example 7 Effect of Cooling Temperature on Entrapment Efficiency of HLL Cisplatin The object was to find an optimum cooling temperature for the highest entrapment of cisplatin and avoid freezing and thawing. 20 mg/mL DPPC, 8 mg/mL cholesterol, and 4 mg/mL cisplatin suspension was prepared by ethanol infusion. The sample was split to three equal aliquots which were treated by 6 cycles of cooling and warming using three different cooling temperatures. After a treatment of temperature cycles the samples were dialyzed to remove free cisplatin. The resulting data (Table 7) helps optimize the manufacturing process.

Samples were prepared as in the previous example. At cooling the temperature of samples was 0° C. The temperature cycle was done by 15 min cooling and 15 min warming. The starting cisplatin concentration was 4 mg/mL and free cisplatin was removed by dialysis. TABLE 8 Effect of Number of Temperature Cycles.

The 20 mL batch was prepared as described in example 4. The 1 L batch was prepared indicated in the following steps: 1. Four grams of cisplatin were dissolved in 1 Liter of injection grade 0.9% sodium chloride at 65° C.2. 20 grams of DPPC and 8 grams of cholesterol were dissolved in 120 mL of absolute ethanol at 65° C.3. While mixing the cisplatin solution at 300 rpm (65° C.), the lipid solution was metered (infused) into the cisplatin solution at a flow rate of 20 mL/min.4. After infusion, cisplatin/lipid dispersion was cooled down to −5° C. to 0° C. using a propylene glycol/water bath and kept for 45 minutes (cooling).5. The dispersion was warmed up to 50° C. and maintained for 15 minutes (warming).6. The cooling/warming cycle described in steps 4 and 5 was performed for two more times (three cycles total).7. The dispersion was washed to remove free cisplatin by diafiltration. The permeate removing rate was 17-22 mL/min. The dispersion volume (1 L) was maintained constant by compensating the permeate with a feed of fresh sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The 200 mL batch was made in the same manner but employed 20% of the components. The process efficiency was defined as the lipid/drug (wt/wt) ratio of initial ingredients divided by the lipid/drug ratio for the final product (Table 9). TABLE 9 Process efficiency.

The resulting data is presented in FIG. 2. Example 11 Density Characterization of Light and Heavy Fractions Samples were prepared as in the previous example. At cooling the temperature of samples was 0° C. The temperature cycle was done by 15 min cooling and 15 min warming. The starting cisplatin concentration was 4 mg/mL and free cisplatin was removed by dialysis. Density Gradient Analysis Seven different batches of cisplatin lipid complex were used for these experiments. Density gradients were formed using Iodixanol (SIGMA (D1556, lot no. 025K1414)) as a dense media and 0.9% NaCl saline solution to keep osmolality close to normal 300 mOsM. First, about 5.5 mL saline was added to the centrifuge tube, and then the same volume of heavy medium (1:1 mixture of Iodixanol 60% and saline) was layered on the bottom of the tube using a syringe with a long needle. Gradients were formed using a BioComp 107ip Gradient Master at the settings: time=2:14 min, angle=79.0, speed=17 rpm, and using the long tube cap. An aliquot of Cisplatin Lipid Complex samples (1 mL) were placed on the top of the gradient and centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm at 20° C. After centrifugation, the top 0.8-1.0 mL volume of clear liquid was discarded, and the next 2 mL was collected representing the light fraction. The light fraction is believed to contain liposomes, wherein at least some of the liposomes are associated with cisplatin. There was a detectable amount of free cisplatin in the light fraction of nebulized samples, which was determined by filtering through Centricon-30 filtering devices and subtracted from the total cisplatin. The rest of the media was removed, leaving only a small yellow pellet on the bottom representing the dense (heavy) fraction, which was subsequently dispersed in 2 mL solution of 75% n-Propanol, 5% saline, 20% water. Cisplatin in the heavy fraction was not completely soluble at this point. An aliquot of this dispersion was taken for cisplatin determination. Another part of the dispersion (1 mL) was mixed with equal volume of 60% n-Propanol and centrifuged 5 min at 1000 rpm on an Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge to settle undissolved cisplatin, and then 1 mL of clear supernatant was used for HPLC lipid determination. Cisplatin Concentration: Cisplatin was measured by HPLC by separating cisplatin on YMC-Pack NH2 column using 90% acetonitrile mobile phase and measuring absorbance at 305 nm. Cisplatin standards and samples were diluted in solution of 75% n-Propanol, 5% saline and 20% water. Standards were used with cisplatin concentrations of 75, 50, 25, and 10 μg/mL. Cisplatin peak retention time was usually around 6.4 min. Lipid Analysis by HPLC. Lipids were analyzed by HPLC as follows: lipids were separated on a Phenomenex Luna C8(2) column using binary gradient mode. Mobile phase A: methanol 70%, acetonitrile 20%, water 10%, ammonium acetate 0.1%, mobile phase B: methanol 70%, acetonitrile 30%, ammonium acetate 0.07%. Lipid standards and samples were diluted in a solution of 60% n-Propanol, 40% water. Lipids were detected by Sedex 55 Evaporative Light Scattering Detector. The retention time for cholesterol was about 8 mm, for DPPC about 10 min. Preparation of Samples on Carbon Coated Grids for TEM Analysis About 50 mL of a cisplatin lipid complex batch was allowed to settle by gravity for at least one week at 4° C. The white to portion containing mostly light fraction was removed and the yellowish brown fraction on the bottom was used for TEM analysis. A small amount of sample (less than 10 microliters) was placed on the carbon coated grid. The grid was placed on the top of a piece of filter paper and spun an Eppendorf centrifuge for 1 minute at 500 RPM to remove excess water. Samples were air-dried for at least one hour before analysis. If centrifugation was done at too low a speed, water was not removed sufficiently enough, and the sample remained too thick, even after drying, tending to boil when exposed to high vacuum inside the TEM microscope. Centrifugation conditions were adjusted to be gentle enough to avoid damage to the grid or loss of the sample. Experimentally, it was found that mild centrifugation at a speed of 200-500×g for 1 min produced samples of good quality with sufficient amount of particles on the grid, but a minimum volume of water. For comparison, samples of cisplatin crystals (not complexed with a lipid) were prepared by the following procedure: 15 mg cisplatin was dissolved in 5 mL saline solution by heating to 50° C. to provide a 3 mg/mL cisplatin solution. The cisplatin solution was briefly sonicated in a bath of room temperature water. At the first signs of cisplatin precipitation and cloudiness, a small volume was taken with a pipette and immediately placed on a carbon coated grid as described in the preceding paragraph. TEM images were obtained on a Zeiss 910 Transmission Electron Microscope at the Princeton Imaging and Analysis Center, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. An accelerating high voltage of 100 kV was used, and pictures were captured on a charged couple device (CCD) camera at magnifications of 2000 to 25,000×. TEM images of heavy fraction lipid-complexed cisplatin are shown in FIGS. 3A-B. The cisplatin-rich particles were electron dense enough to be seen without staining. TEM images of cisplatin crystals which are not complexed with a lipid are shown in FIGS. 4A-B. The un-complexed cisplatin crystals appear as dark particles of rectangular shape approximately 2 microns wide and 10-20 microns long. It is believed that the cisplatin particles in the lipid-complexed cisplatin are surrounded by a lipid bilayer, and therefore, cannot grow as large as “free” cisplatin. Additionally, the cisplatin in the lipid-complexed cisplatin does not dissolve in saline upon dilution, further suggesting that the cisplatin is surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Results Nine batches of Lipid-cisplatin complex were fractionated on an Iodixanol density gradient as described in the Methods section. All nine samples separated into a similarly positioned white band of light fraction and a yellow pellet of dense fraction. 2 mL of the light fraction were collected and the rest of the liquid was removed. The remaining pellet was dispersed in 2 mL of 75% n-Propanol. Cisplatin and lipid concentrations in each fraction were measured by HPLC as described. The lipid/cisplatin ratio in the dense fraction was very high so that both lipid and cisplatin could not be solubilized in same solvent at high enough concentration for the lipid analysis. For that reason, the lipid-cisplatin mixture in 75% n-propanol solution was centrifuged to remove the insoluble portion of the cisplatin, and the supernatant was used as is for lipid HPLC analysis, as described in Methods. Results of the density gradient analysis are presented in Table 10. L/D represents the ratio of lipid to cisplatin by weight. The percentages presented are with respect to the total cisplatin or lipid in the formulation. Lower section of the table shows averages of lipid and cisplatin contents in each fraction derived from all nine samples tested. Standard deviations (SD) are shown to demonstrate consistency. These data demonstrate that the majority of lipid (90.6% on average, +/−3.1%) is in the light fraction, while only 0.87+/−0.09% lipid is in the dense fraction. The majority of cisplatin (82.3+/−2.9%) is in the dense fraction, while only 8.4+/−2.1% is in the light fraction. The lipid to drug ratio (L/D) calculated for the total sample was an average of 22.7. The same L/D ratio in separate fractions was as high as 255+/−47 for the light fraction, and as low as 0.24+/−0.03 for dense fraction.

This mixture was in half and 20 mL portions were layered on the top of another 10 mL iodixanol 30% in saline using two 50 mL centrifuge tubes. The samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4000 rpm at 5° C. on an Eppendorf 5810 centrifuge. Supernatant, containing a mixture of light and heavy fractions, was discarded. The pellet, containing the dense fraction of the cisplatin lipid composition, was gently dispersed in 5 mL of saline. After determining the concentration of cisplatin, the concentration was adjusted to make the concentration 2.7 mg/mL of cisplatin. To obtain the light fraction, the cisplatin lipid complex batch was allowed to settle by gravity at 5° C. for 1 week. The top portion of the sample, containing the light fraction, was collected. Nebulization Studies TEM Analysis of Nebulized Lipid-Complexed Cisplatin: 5 mL of sample was nebulized using a PARI-LC STAR nebulizer, and the aerosol was collected by a chilled (ice water) impinger. From the impinger, 2.5 mL of the nebulizate was obtained for the analysis. An aliquot of the nebulizate was filter-centrifuged using a centricon-YM-30, when necessary, immediately after nebulization to determine non-encapsulated (free) cisplatin. Nebulization air pressure was 30 PSI and the flow rate of the aerosol collection system provided by the pump was 8 L/min. 1 mL of aerosol, collected in an impinger, was diluted with 2 mL of saline and allowed to incubate at 4° C. for 20 hours. In parallel, 1 mL of the original (non-nebulized) formulation was treated the same. After the heavy fraction settled, the whiter top portion of each sample was removed and the yellowish portion was dispersed in a solution of 10% iodixanol in saline. Samples were centrifuged at 4000 RPM for 20 minutes on an Eppendorf 5810 centrifuge. Supernatants were discarded and pellets having heavy fraction particles dispersed in 200 microliters saline each. the amount of heavy fraction pellet obtained from the nebulized formulation was less than the amount from the original formulation. Samples for TEM were prepared as described previously. FIG. 5 depicts TEM images of the nebulized heavy fraction particles and FIG. 6A-B depicts TEM images of the non-nebulized heavy fraction particles. In both cases, the particles are dark and dense of rectangular and rhomboidal shape of average size between 1 and 2 microns. In some instances, bigger and longer particles of 3 microns and greater in size were present in the non-nebulized sample (FIG. 8B) compared to the nebulized sample. Density Gradient Analysis of Nebulized Lipid-Complexed Cisplatin: 5 mL of sample was nebulized as described above. Within a few hours after nebulization, a 1 mL sample was run on the density gradient system. Visibly all the gradients appeared similar to the ones of the original samples (non-nebulized). Each fraction was collected as described above and analyzed for lipid and cisplatin content. The results of density gradient analysis of the samples after nebulization are presented in Table 11. Similar to the non-nebulized samples, the majority of lipid (85.2% on average, =/−6.1%) was found in the light fraction, while only 0.36%+/−0.08% lipid was in the dense fraction. The distribution of cisplatin was 46.0+/−1.2% in the dense fraction, and 8.5+/−1.1% in the light fraction. The L/D ratio was similar to that in the non-nebulized samples, being 232+/−15 for the light fraction, and 0.18+/−0.03 for the dense fraction. TABLE 11 Density Gradient Analysis After Nebulization.

While not being bound by any particular theory, the above data indicates that a significant portion of cisplatin leaks out of the dense fraction during nebulization, but does not leak out of the light fraction to a significant extent. The separated light and dense fractions were nebulized as described above and then analyzed for total and free cisplatin. Table 13 shows the results, compared with nebulization of the total cisplatin lipid complex. The total cisplatin lipid complex sample lost 45.1% of encapsulated cisplatin during nebulization. The light fraction was essentially unchanged. The dense fraction lost more than 70% of its original encapsulated cisplatin. The results demonstrate that the dense fraction leaks, while the light fraction essentially does not. Additionally, the dense fraction leaked to a greater extent when nebulized alone, compared to the total cisplatin lipid complex sample. While not being bound by any particular, it is believed that liposomes contained in the light fraction “protect” the dense particles during nebulization, thereby reducing cisplatin leakage.

Batches 17-20 are shown in FIGS. 8A-D, respectively. The optical micrographs depict round particles of about 1 to 2 microns in size, or less, and a number of rod-shaped particles of about 1-2 microns wide and up to about 10 microns in length. Example 14 Freeze Fracture Images An aliquot of the sample was plated on a copper plate and then sandwiched with another copper plate. This sample sandwich was quickly frozen by dipping into liquid propane and transferred to a copper plate holder, which was immersed in liquid nitrogen. The holder was transferred into a vacuum-freeze chamber (Balzers freeze-etching system BAF 400 T), which was at a temperature of 170° C. with a vacuum of 2-5×10−6 bar. Fracturing and subsequent Pt and carbon coating were carried out at −115° C. The replica was taken out of the chamber and treated with 2% nitric acid for about 4-5 hours, followed by bleaching overnight. The washed replica was placed on a copper grid for EM observation. Representative freeze fracture images are shown in Figure Example 16 Particle Size Analysis Samples of the heavy fraction comprising lipid-complexed cisplatin were diluted in filtered saline (NaCl 0.9%) at a ratio of 1:2000 and analyzed by an AccuSizer Optical Particle Sizer 780 using the following settings: injection loop volume 1 mL, Data collection time 60 s, Detector LE 400-05SE summary mode, Minimum diameter 0.05 microns. The detector used counts only particles 0.5 microns and larger. Four batches were analyzed (batch nos. 17-20), as shown in FIGS. 10A-D. The distribution plots show relative volumes occupied by particles of different sizes. The particles in the range of 0.5 to 1 micron represent the right side tail of the main distribution of the light fraction, the majority of which has particle sizes less than 5 microns. The plots also show a large peak at the right from 1 micron to 20 micron, with a median size of about 8 to 10 microns. Batches 17 and 20 were subjected to particle size analysis after nebulization as well, and the results are shown in FIGS. 11A-B.
