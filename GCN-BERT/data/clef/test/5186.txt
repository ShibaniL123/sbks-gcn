Synthesis of (R)-4-benzyl-3-(3-phenylpropanoyl)oxazolidin-2-one ((R)-12)
The procedure was similar to that of (R)-9 except the following reagents were used: (R)-8 (1.5 g, 8.47 mmol), n-butyl lithium (4.1 mL of 2.5 M solution, 10.16 mmol), and 3-phenyl propanoyl chloride (1.64 mL, 11 mmol). The reaction gave (R)-12 in 90% yield (2.36 g).
