To the stirred solution of 1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-isoindole-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (10 g, 62 mmol, 1 eq) in dry THF (200 mL) were added 4,4-diethoxy-butylamine (13.6 g, 62 mmol, 1 eq) and TEA (8.6 mL, 62 mmol, 1 eq) under ice cooled condition and stirred at RT for 16 h. After completion of the reaction, it was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain crude product which was purified by silica gel (100-200 mesh) column chromatography (5% EA/Hexane) to afford 2-(4,4-diethoxy-butyl)-isoindole-1,3-dione (17 g, 94% yield) as light yellowish liquid.
