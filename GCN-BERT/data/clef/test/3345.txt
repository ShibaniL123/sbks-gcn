DISPLAYING PRODUCT FIELD The invention relates to displaying product. BACKGROUND Figure 1 shows an existing display system 1 known as a pallet rack. Dexion™ is a wellknown brand of such pallet racking. The rack 1 includes four uprights 3a to 3d set at a rectangular horizontal pitch to define a front, a back and a side of a bay. The uprights take the form of vertical channel sections. The “floor” of each channel section includes two vertical columns of apertures. The left-hand side two 3a, 3b of the uprights are mutually connected by a trio of vertically spaced horizontal members and a pair of inclined members. The right-hand side uprights 3c, 3d are likewise mutually connected. The long openings of the channel section uprights open inwardly, i.e. towards the foreaft centre of the display system 1. The five illustrated connecting members that interconnect the uprights 3a, 3b are received through these openings into the interiors of the channels. A quartet of horizontally extending beams 5a to 5d run horizontally along the length of the display system. The beam 5a connects the left rear upright 3a to the right rear upright 3d, whilst the front lower beam 5d connects the front left upright 3b to the right front upright 3c. The beams 5a, 5d are mutually parallel and sit at the same height to carry product in the form of pallets. In the illustrated display system 1, the beams 5a, 5d are dimensioned to accommodate two standard pallets side by side. The upper beams 5b, 5c are arranged in closely analogous fashion to the lower beams 5a, 5d but sit above those lower beams to define a second, upper, product-carrying location. The beams have suitable end formations for engaging the apertures of the uprights so that the beams may be moved up and down along the columns of apertures to adjust the height of the cargo carrying positions. Similar display systems are sometimes used for displaying product other than pallets or palletised product. By way of example, the beams 5a, 5b might carry a bench top in the form of a horizontal plate. Such display systems are sometimes employed by retailers to, for example, display product to their customers. Other times such display systems might be used by technicians in industrial environments to store and display their own tools for easy access. In either context, and in other contexts, it is desirable to extend the display capacity of the display system to conveniently and attractively display more product. In Figure 1, a single bay of the display system is shown. Often a display system will include multiple bays. Adjacent bays of the display system may share uprights. By example, a second bay may be added to the display system 1 by adding two further uprights (akin to the uprights 3c, 3d) and four further beams (akin to the beams 5a to 5d). SUMMARY In broad summary, the present inventors have recognised that the sides of display systems such as the display system 1 typically go unutilised. Accordingly, one aspect of the invention provides a method of extending the displaying capacity of a display system including the step of displaying product at at least one side of the display system. Another aspect of the invention provides a display board extender mountable at the side of a display system to extend the display system’s displaying capacity. Yet another aspect of the invention provides a display system including such a display board extender. Of course, once presented with this inventive concept, it is possible to implement the method in a variety of ways. Likewise the extender, and the display system including the extender, may take a wide variety of forms. Preferred forms of the invention are described herein. The invention is not limited to these forms. Rather the invention is defined by the claims. Disclosed herein is a display system including four uprights set at a rectangular horizontal pitch to define a front, a back and a side of a bay; and a member, for carrying product, connecting one of the uprights at one end of the bay to another of the uprights at the other end of the bay; and a display system extender connected to one of the uprights to carry further product. The display system extender may be cantilevered from the one of the uprights so as to have an unsupported free end. The extender preferably includes apertures spaced at a constant pitch, and most preferably is formed of sheet material. The display system extender may include a stiffening flange running along at least one of its edges. Preferred forms of the display system extender include two apertures through which fasteners engage, to connect the display system extender to, the one of the uprights. Also disclosed is a display system extender formed of sheet material and including two apertures by which is it connectable to an upright of a display system; apertures, for carrying product, spaced a regular pitch; and a stiffening flange. Also disclosed is a method of extending the display capacity of a display system, the display system including four uprights set at a rectangular horizontal pitch to define a front, a back and a side of a bay; and a member, for carrying product, connecting one of the uprights at one end of the bay to another of the uprights at the other end of the bay; the method including displaying product at the side of the display system. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS An embodiment of the apparatus will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: • Figure 1 is a perspective view of a prior art display system; • Figure 2 is a perspective view of the corner of a display system; • Figure 3a is an elevation of a display system extender; • Figure 3b is a top view of the display system extender; • Figure 3c is a side view of the display system extender; and Figure 3d is a perspective view of the display system extender. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS The following examples are intended to illustrate the scope of the invention and to enable reproduction and comparison. They are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure in any way. Figure 2 illustrates a display system 10 including: • uprights 13a, 13b; • members in the form of horizontally extending beams 15a, 15b; • a bench top 15℮; and • a display system extender 17. The display system 10 is a table for displaying hardware items. The uprights 13a, 13b are two of four uprights which are set on a horizontal rectangular pitch to define table legs. The beam 15a runs horizontally to connect rearward left leg 13a to the other rearward leg (not shown). The beam 15d likewise mutually connects the two front legs. The legs and beams may well be Dexion™ product. The table top 15c includes a large plate-like section which sits on the beams 15a, 15d and substantially spans the rectangular region defined by the four table legs. The plate section of the table top 15℮ is formed of sheet material having downward flanges extending from each of its four edges so that it has the appearance of a bench top in the vicinity of 50mm thick. An elevated display portion 15f runs, along the lengthwise centre line of the plate-like portion of the table top 15℮, from end to end of the table top 15℮. The elevated display portion 15f is formed of a long, narrow, rectangular web of sheet material having an about 100 mm long flange extending downwardly from each of its four edges. The elevated display portion 15f is fastened to the plate-like portion of the table top 15℮. An arrangement of mounting apertures runs along the lengthwise centre line of the elevated display portion 15f. A respective pair of like arrangements of display apertures opens through the plate-like portion of the table top fore and aft of the elevated central portion 15f. Each of the five arrangements of mounting apertures includes a central line of equispaced circular apertures sitting centrally between two lines of lengthwise extending and lengthwise spaced slots. The slots are substantially identical and set at a constant pitch. In this example, the table top 15℮ including its elevated display portion 15f and its arrangements of display apertures is symmetric about its lengthwise centre line. The display system extender 17 is in this example a single integral body. In this case it is formed of 1.5 mm thick zinc anneal. Of course, other sheet materials and indeed entirely different modes of construction are possible. Desirably the extender 17 has a surface coating. An adhesive vinyl decal is one form of surface coating. In this example, the decal takes the form of Interpon Vivica Mercury Silver Gloss GW003K. The extender 17 includes a main body 17a and a pair of stiffening flanges 17b, 17c. The main body 17a is a planar rectangular plate which in use is arranged to occupy a vertical plane so that its long axis runs horizontally. This stiffening flange 17b runs horizontally along most of the top edge of the main body 17a. In this example, the body 17a is in the vicinity of 340 mm long, whilst the flange is in the vicinity of 280 mm long. In this example, the extender 17 is symmetrical about its vertical centre line. In particular, the flange 17b is centrally mounted along the top edge of the main body 17a such that there is a flangeless portion about 30mm long at each end of the adaptor 17. A pair of screw holes 17d opens through each end of the body 17a. The screw holes 17d pass through the flangeless end portion of the main body 17a. As illustrated in Figure 2, the flangeless portion of the body 17a is in use arranged to overlie a side wall of the leg 13b. Suitable fasteners, e.g. screws, are passed through the apertures 17d and engage the leg 13b to connect the extender 17 to the leg 13b. In this mounting configuration, the extender 17 depends from only the leg 13b and extends from that front leg in cantilever fashion in the rearward direction. A free end of the extender sits at about the lengthwise centre line of the display system 10. There is a pair of screw holes 17d at each end of the body 17a whereby the extender 17 can be installed either as a left-hand or as a right-handed version. By way of example, in Figure 2 the right-hand screw holes 17d are used to mount the extender 17 to extend rearwardly from the forward left leg 17b, whereas alternatively the left-hand screw holes 17d could be used to mount the extender to extend rearwardly from the right front leg (not shown). Alternatively, the extender could be mounted to extend forwardly from a rearward leg. Of course, modes of attachment other than the fastening hole 17d are possible. By way of example, the extender 17 may be formed with downwardly extending hooks to hook into suitable apertures of the uprights 13a, 13b. More elaborate arrangements are also possible, such as the applicant’s own Pro-Click System™ which includes a suitable spring-loaded fastener which may be passed through an aperture akin to the aperture 17d, and through a complementary aperture of the leg 13b before expanding to prevent reversal of the projection through that aperture whereby the extender 17 and a portion of the leg 13b is captured between a head and the expanded portion of the fastener. Desirably, the fastening arrangement, which may be integrated with the extender 17, includes a portion accessible from the front of the extender 17 to effect retraction of the extended portion, to allow removal of the extender from the upright 13b. Most preferably, this accessible portion requires a tool for operation to resist casual, tool-less, replacement of the extender 17. Some variants of the extender may not be mounted in cantilever fashion. By way of example, the extender may be sufficiently long so as to be fastened to both of the uprights 13a, 13b. Nor is the extender limited to any particular vertical height. For example, whereas the extender 17 is about 160 mm high, other variants may be a much taller panel. Running horizontally along the lower margin of the main body 17a is a line of peg board holes 17℮. The peg board holes are configured to co-operate with conventional peg board fittings. In this example, the holes each have a diameter of about 5 mm and are spaced at a pitch of about 12.5 mm (i.e. about 1/2 inch). The row of holes 17℮ constitutes a ticket strip and the space thereabove is a convenient information display region. By way of example, the displayed information may be product information and/or branding. Existing peg board fittings, such as those with a horizontally-projecting elongate member having a slightly upturned end, may be fitted to the holes 17℮ so that those horizontally extending members provide convenient hanging points for product to be displayed. By way of example, elongate items such as drill bits carried in suitable plastic envelopes may be hung from the elongate member so as to be carried by the extender 17. The extender 17 is illustrated as mounted below the table top 15℮. Alternatively, it might be mounted above the table top. 1.
