The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a polymer containing benzohetero[1,3]diazole units. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a polymer containing benzohetero[1,3]diazole units which comprises reacting at least one disubstituted benzohetero[1,3]diazole compound with at least one heteroaryl compound. Said polymer can be advantageously used in the construction of photovoltaic devices such as, for example, photovoltaic cells, photovoltaic modules, solar cells, solar modules, on both a rigid and flexible support. Furthermore, said polymer can be advantageously used in the construction of Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFTs), or of Organic Field Effect Transistors (OFETs). The exploitation of solar energy by means of the photovoltaic technology is considered one of the best ways for responding to the increasing energy demand of our planet. Photovoltaic devices are capable of converting the energy of a luminous radiation into electric energy. At present, most photovoltaic devices which can be used for practical applications exploit the physico-chemical properties of photoactive materials of the inorganic type, in particular high-purity crystalline silicon. As a result of the high production costs of silicon, scientific research, however, has been orienting its efforts towards the development of alternative organic materials having a polymeric structure (the so-called “polymer photovoltaic cells”). Unlike high-purity crystalline silicon, in fact, organic polymers are characterized by a relative synthesis facility, a low production cost, a reduced weight of the relative photovoltaic device. The most widely-used polymer photovoltaic cells are those with an architecture known as “bulk heterojunction”, having a photoactive layer comprising an electron-donor compound and an electron-acceptor compound which form a mixture in which the two phases consisting of said electron-donor compound and of said electron-acceptor compound form a dispersion on a nanometric level with an extremely high contact area. Yu et al., for example, in: “Polymer Photovoltaic Cells: Enhanced Efficiencies via a Network of Internal Donor-Acceptor Heterojunction”, Science (1995), Vol. 270, pages 1789-1791, describe polymer photovoltaic cells of the type reported above in which the photoactive layer comprises a mixture of an electron-donor compound, in particular a conjugated polymer, more specifically poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) and of an electron-acceptor compound, in particular PC61BM (6,6 phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester). Polymer photovoltaic cells of the type described above can currently reach conversion efficiencies of solar radiation into electric energy ranging, on an average, from 1% to 6%: the maximum conversion efficiency obtained has been 8.3%. The basic conversion process of light into electric current in a polymer photovoltaic cell takes place through the following steps: 1. absorption of a photon on the part of the electron-donor compound with the formation of an exciton, i.e. a pair of “electron-electronic gap (or hole)” charge transporters; 2. diffusion of the exciton in a region of the electron-donor compound as far as the interface with the electron-acceptor compound; 3. dissociation of the exciton in the two charge transporters: electron (−) in the acceptor phase (i.e. in the electron-acceptor compound) and electronic gap [(or hole) (+)] in the donor phase (i.e. in the electron-donor compound); 4. transporting of the charges thus formed to the cathode (electron, through the electron-acceptor compound) and to the anode [electronic gap (or hole), through the electron-donor compound], with the generation of an electric current in the circuit of the organic photovoltaic cell. The photo-absorption process with the formation of the exciton and the subsequent yielding of the electron to the electron-acceptor compound leads to the excitation of an electron from the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) to the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) of the electron-donor compound and, subsequently, the passage from this to the LUMO of the electron-acceptor compound. As the efficiency of a polymer photovoltaic cell depends on the number of free electrons which are generated by dissociation of the excitons which in turn can be directly correlated with the number of photons absorbed, one of the structural characteristics of the electron-donor compounds which mostly influences said efficiency is the difference in energy existing between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the electron-donor compound, i.e. the so-called band-gap. The maximum wave-length value at which the electron-donor compound is capable of collecting and effectively converting photons into electric energy, i.e. the so-called “photon harvesting” or “light-harvesting” process, depends on this difference. In order to obtain acceptable electric currents, the band-gap between HOMO and LUMO must not be excessively high, but at the same time must not be excessively low. An excessively low band-gap would in fact correspond to an excessively high HOMO which would jeopardize the voltage obtained at the electrodes of the device (this voltage can be in fact correlated to the difference between HOMO and LUMO of the electron-donor compound). In the simplest way of operating, the polymer photovoltaic cells having an architecture known as “bulk heterojunction” described above, are produced by introducing a thin layer (about 100 nanometers) of a mixture of the electron-acceptor compound and of the electron-donor compound (architecture known as “bulk heterojunction”), between two electrodes, normally consisting of indium-tin oxide (ITO) (anode) and aluminium (Al) (cathode). In order to produce a layer of this type, a solution of the two components is generally prepared and a photoactive film is subsequently created on the anode [indium-tin oxide (ITO] starting from this solution, resorting to suitable deposition techniques such as, for example, “spin-coating”, “spray-coating” “ink-jet printing”, and the like. At the end, the counter-electrode [i.e. the aluminium cathode. (Al)] is deposited on the dried film. Optionally, other additional layers capable of exerting specific functions of an electric, optical or mechanical nature, can be introduced between the electrodes and the photovoltaic film. In order to facilitate the electronic gaps (or holes) in reaching the anode [indium-tin oxide (ITO)] and at the same time to block the transport of electrons, thus allowing an improved collection of the charges on the part of the electrode and inhibiting recombination phenomena, before creating the photoactive film starting from the mixture of acceptor compound and of donor compound as described above, a film is deposited, starting from an aqueous suspension of PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfon-ate], resorting to suitable deposition techniques such as, for example, “spin-coating”, “spray-coating” “ink-jet printing”, and the like. At the end, the counter-electrode [i.e. the aluminium cathode (Al)] is deposited on the dried film. The electron-donor compound which is most commonly used in the construction of organic photovoltaic cells is regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). This polymer has optimal electronic and optical characteristics (good HOMO and LUMO orbital values, good adsorption coefficient), a good solubility in the solvents used in the construction of photovoltaic cells and a reasonable mobility of the electronic holes. Other examples of polymers which can be advantageously used as electron-donor compounds are: the polymer PCDTBT {poly[N-9″-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole]}, the polymer PCPDTBT {poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-dithio-phene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)]}. As is known, conjugated polymers consist of alternating σ and π bonds and have a σ bond skeleton due to the superimposition of sp2 orbitals. Furthermore, the pz orbitals of a carbon atom are superimposed with the pz orbitals of the adjacent atoms allowing the formation of a system of π bonds: the electrons of the π bonds are therefore delocalized on the whole molecule. The above conjugated polymers have electronic properties similar to those of inorganic semiconductors: said electronic properties derive from the delocalization of the π bonds. The electron-donor conjugated polymers used in polymer photovoltaic cells must be capable of reaching good conversion efficiencies of solar radiation to electric energy. In this respect, it should be remembered that, in order to be advantageously used in polymer photovoltaic cells, an electron-donor conjugated polymer must have: energy levels compatible with those of the electron-acceptor polymer (e.g., a derivative of fullerene);a high mobility of the electronic gaps;a certain crystallinity degree;a good solubility in organic solvents;a good compatibility with the organic acceptor polymer in order to confer an appropriate morphology to the active phase;a high photo-stability;a low band-gap value (≦2 eV). In particular, as far as the band-gap value is concerned, it should be remembered that the flow of photons of solar radiation which reaches the surface of the Earth is maximum for energy values of around 1.8 eV (corresponding to radiations having a wavelength of about 700 nm). Due to the high band-gap values generally higher than 2 eV, which characterize the above electron-donor compounds, the light harvesting or photon harvesting process within this spectral field is not very efficient and only a fraction of the overall solar energy, generally that ranging from 350 nm to 650 nm, is converted into electric energy. Among the polymers most widely-used as donor compounds, for example, the above-mentioned regioregular polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) has a band-gap equal to 1.9 eV. In order to improve the yield of the light harvesting or photon harvesting process and, consequently, the efficiency of the organic photovoltaic devices, it is therefore fundamental to find new electron-donor polymers capable of capturing and of converting solar radiations having a lower energy, i.e. electron-donor polymers characterized by lower band-gap values than those of polymers typically used as electron-donor compounds. A great effort has been made in the art for finding electron-donor polymers having a low band-gap value. One of the most widely-used strategies for obtaining electron-donor polymers having a low band-gap, for example, is the synthesis of alternating conjugated copolymers comprising electron-rich units (donor) and electron-poor units (acceptor). A synthesis of this kind is described, for example, by Chen et al. in: “Development of Novel Conjugated Donor Polymers for High-Efficiency Bulk-Heterojunction Photovoltaic Devices”, Account of Chemical Research (2009), Vol. 42(11), pages 1709-1718. One of the monomeric units most widely-used as electron-poor unit (acceptor) for obtaining alternating conjugated polymers comprising electron-rich units (donor) and electron-poor units (acceptor) having a low band-gap, is 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole having formula (1): Said alternating conjugated polymers are also characterized by a high electronic mobility and by a wide absorption spectrum. Examples of electron-rich units (donor), comprising thiophene and its derivatives, used in the above alternating conjugated polymers are indicated hereunder in Figure 1: wherein R generally represents a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group. Processes for the synthesis of the above alternating conjugated polymers are known in the art. Cheng et al. in: “Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers for Organic Solar Cell Applications”, Chemical Review (2009), Vol. 109, pages 5868-5923, for example, describe various processes for the preparation of conjugated polymers. Said processes are carried out in the presence of metallic catalysts, in particular catalysts containing palladium, and/or in the presence of compounds containing metals such as, for example, palladium, nickel, zinc, magnesium, tin, lithium, and the like. Said processes, however, can have various drawbacks due to the effects of the metallic residues which can remain in the conjugated polymers thus obtained. It is known, in fact, that the properties of said alternating conjugated polymers, in particular the electrical properties, can be negatively influenced by the presence of metallic residues as described, for example, by: Sonar et al. in “A study on the effects metal residues in poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) have on field-effect transistor device characteristics”, Synthetic Metal (2007), Vol. 157, pages 872-875; Krebs et al. in “Influence of Residual Catalyst on the Properties of Conjugated Polyphenylenevinylene Materials: Palladium Nanoparticles and Poor. Electrical Performance”, Chemical Material (2004), Vol. 16, pages 1313-1318; Björklund et al. in “The effects of metal impurities in poly[2,5-bis(3-decylthiophen-2-yl)-thienol[2,3-b]-thiophene] on field-effect transistor properties”, Organic Electronics (2009), Vol. 10, pages 215-221. Processes are also known for the preparation of said alternating conjugated polymers capable of reducing the quantity of metallic catalysts and/or of compounds containing metals used therein. Alternating conjugated polymers having formula (Ib), for example, can be prepared by means of a process which comprises reacting, in the presence of catalysts containing palladium, 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole having formula (Ia) with a di-tri-alkyl-stannyl arene having formula (2) (Stille reaction indicated hereunder in Scheme 1), or with a heteroarene (Stille reaction not indicated hereunder in Scheme 1), or with a di-arylboronic acid having formula (3) (Suzuki reaction indicated hereunder in Scheme 2) or with a di-heteroarylboronic acid or their corresponding ester derivative (Suzuki reaction not indicated hereunder in Scheme 2): wherein Ar represents the electron-rich units (donor) indicated above in Figure 1, and the substituents R′, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group; wherein Ar has the meanings described above and the substituents R, the same or different from each other, represent a hydrogen atom, or a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group, or the OR groups together with the other atoms to which they are bound can form a heterocyclic ring having the following formula (4): wherein the substituents R′, the same or different from each other, represent a hydrogen atom, or a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group, and B is boron. The above Stille and Suzuki reactions are generally catalyzed by bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride [PdCl2(PPh3)2], as such or prepared in situ starting from palladium chloride (PdCl2) and triphenylphosphine; or palladium(0)-tetrakistriphenyl-phosphine [Pd(PPh3)3], or palladium(II) acetate [Pd(OAc)2], or other phosphines such as, for example, tri-ortho-tolyl phosphine or tris-para-tolyl phosphine. Stille and Suzuki reactions can be carried out in solvents selected, for example, from: ethers (for example, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran); hydrocarbons (toluene, xylene); dipolar aprotic solvents (N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide). The reaction temperatures generally range from 80° C. to 160° C. In the case of Suzuki reactions, a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate or of potassium bicarbonate, or a saturated aqueous solution of sodium or of potassium carbonate, must be added. At the end of the above reactions, the product obtained, i.e. the polymer, is generally precipitated in alcohol such as, for example, methanol, the precipitate obtained is washed with a solvent such as, for example, heptane or ethyl ether, obtaining a residue which is re-dissolved in a solvent such as, for example, chloroform or chlorobenzene, and re-precipitated in an alcohol such as, for example, methanol. Tri-alkyl-stannyl arenes are generally prepared starting from the corresponding halogen arenes (Ar′—X) by reaction with an alkyl lithium such as, for example, n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi), to give the corresponding aryl lithium (Ar′—Li), which is reacted in situ with a tri-alkyl-stannyl chloride [ClSn(R″)3] to give the corresponding tri-alkyl-stannyl arene [Ar′—Sn(R″)3] as indicated hereunder in Scheme 3: wherein Ar′ represents an arene or a heteroarene, X represents a halogen atom, preferably bromine, and the substituents R″, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group. If 2-tri-alkyl-stannyl thiophene (Ar=thiophene) is to be prepared, it is not necessary to use the corresponding halogen arene, i.e. 2-halogen thiophene, as the thiophene having formula (5) can be reacted directly with an alkyl lithium such as, for example, n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi), or with a lithium di-alkyl amide (reaction not indicated in Scheme 4), obtaining a thienyl-lithium having formula (6) which can be reacted in situ with a tri-alkyl-stannyl chloride [ClSn(R″)3] to give the corresponding tri-alkyl-stannyl thiophene having formula (7) as indicated hereunder in Scheme 4: wherein the substituents R″, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group. Analogously, di(tri-alkyl stannyl arenes) (10) can be prepared by reacting a di-halogen arene having formula (8) with an alkyl lithium such as, for example, n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi), obtaining a di-lithium-arene having formula (9), which can be reacted in situ with a tri-alkyl-stannyl chloride [ClSn(R″)3] as indicated hereunder in Scheme 5; or di-2,5-tri-alkylstannylthiophenes having formula (13) can be prepared, by reacting a bis-thiophene-bis-thienyl derivative having formula (11) with an alkyl lithium such as, for example, n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi), obtaining a di-lithium-bis-thienyl derivative having formula (12) which can be reacted in situ with a tri-alkyl-stannyl chloride [ClSn(R″)3] as indicated hereunder in Scheme 6: wherein Ar′ represents an arene or a heteroarene, and the substituents R″, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group; wherein Y represents a group selected from the electron-rich units (donor) indicated above in Figure 1, m is 0 or 1, and the substituents R″, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group. The processes described above, however, can have some drawbacks. In the case of the Stille reaction (Scheme 1), for example, the stannylated compounds used in the reaction and obtained with the processes indicated in the above schemes (Scheme 3, Scheme 4, Scheme 5 and Scheme 6), are not easy to purify with the normal laboratory techniques. Consequently low yields of stannylated compounds are obtained, as significant quantities of the same are lost during the purification. Furthermore, the processes indicated in the above schemes require the use of highly flammable and dangerous substances such as, for example, alkyl lithium compounds and perfectly anhydrous operating conditions. Furthermore, organic derivatives of tin are substances that are extremely toxic for human beings and harmful for the environment. In the case of the Suzuki reaction (Scheme 2), instead of derivatives of tin, the corresponding boron derivatives, acids or esters, are used. Like tin derivatives, boron-derivatives are generally prepared starting from the corresponding halogen arenes (Ar′—X) by reaction with an alkyl lithium, such as, for example, n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi), to give the corresponding aryl lithium (Ar′—Li), which is reacted in situ with a boron ester, such as, for example, 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (reaction not indicated in Scheme 7), or with a tri-alkyl-borate [B(OR″)3], to give the corresponding diester of arylboronic acid [Ar′—B(OR″)2] as indicated hereunder in Scheme 7: wherein Ar′ represents an arene or a heteroarene, X represents a halogen atom, preferably bromine, and the substituents R″, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group, or two of the groups OR″ together with the atoms to which they are bound can form a heterocyclic ring having formula (4) indicated above. If the ester of thienyl-2-boronic acid is to be prepared, it is not necessary to use the corresponding halogen arene, i.e. 2-halogen thiophene as starting material, as the thiophene having formula (5) can be reacted directly with an alkyl lithium such as, for example, n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi), or with a lithium di-alkyl amide (reaction not indicated in Scheme 8) obtaining a thienyl-lithium having formula (6) which can be reacted in situ with a tri-alkyl borate [B(OR″)3], to give the corresponding diester of thienylboronic acid [Ar′—B(OR″)2] having formula (7a) as indicated hereunder in Scheme 8: wherein the substituents R″, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group, or two of the groups OR″ together with the atoms to which they are bound can form a heterocyclic ring having formula (4) indicated above. Analogously, the esters of di-arylboronic acids having formula (3) can be prepared by reacting a di-halogen arene having formula (8) with an alkyl lithium such as, for example, n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi), obtaining a di-lithium-arene having formula (9) which can be reacted in situ with a tri-alkyl borate [B(OR″)3] as indicated hereunder in Scheme 9; or di-2,5-thienylboronic acids (13a) can be prepared by reacting a di-thienyl derivative having formula (11) with an alkyl lithium such as, for example, n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi), obtaining a di-lithium-bis-thienyl derivative having formula (12) which can be reacted in situ with a tri-alkyl borate [B(OR″)3] as indicated hereunder in Scheme 10: wherein Ar represents an arene or a heteroarene, and the substituents R″, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group, or the groups OR″ together with the atoms to which they are bound can form a heterocyclic ring having formula (4) indicated above; wherein Y represents a group selected from the electron-rich units (donor) indicated above in Figure 1, m is 0 or 1, and the substituents R″, the same or different from each other, represent a linear or branched C1-C20 alkyl group, or two of the groups OR″ together with the atoms to which they are bound can form a heterocyclic ring having formula (4) indicated above. Boron derivatives can also have some drawbacks, however. Also in this case, their purification is not easy and is often accompanied by a partial degradation of the boron derivative. Unlike stannylated compounds, boron esters are not substances which are toxic and harmful for the environment. Like stannylated compounds, their preparation, however, requires the use of highly flammable and dangerous substances such as alkyl lithium compounds and perfectly anhydrous operating conditions. The Applicant has therefore considered the problem of finding a process for the production of a polymer containing benzohetero[1,3]diazole units capable of overcoming the above drawbacks. In particular, the Applicant has considered the problem of finding a process for the production of a polymer containing benzohetero[1,3]diazole units which does not require the use of stannylated or boronated compounds. The Applicant has now found that the production of a polymer containing a benzohetero[1,3]diazole unit can be carried out by means of a process which comprises reacting at least one disubstituted benzohetero[1,3]diazole compound with at least one heteroaryl compound. Said process avoids the use of stannylated or boronated compounds with a consequent saving of times and of process costs, in addition to negative effects on the environment and/or on the health of the operators. Furthermore, said process allows a reduction in the quantity of metallic residues present in the polymer obtained, and also to obtain a tin-free polymer. Said polymer can be advantageously used in the construction of photovoltaic devices such as, for example, photovoltaic cells, photovoltaic modules, solar cells, solar modules, on both a rigid and flexible support. Furthermore, said polymer can be advantageously used in the construction of Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFTs), or of Organic Field Effect Transistors (OFETs) An object of the present invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of a polymer containing benzohetero[1,3]diazole units having general formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV): wherein: R1, R2, R3 and R6, the same or different from each other, represent a hydrogen atom; a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl group; a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkoxyl group;Y represents a penta- or hexa-atomic heteroarylene group, also benzo-condensed or heterobicyclic, containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, silicon, selenium, phosphorous such as, for example, thiophenylene, 3,4-dialkylthiophenylene, 3,4-dialkoxythiophenyl-ene, 2,7-(9,9-dialkyl)fluorenylene, 3,6-(9-alkyl)carbazolene, 2,7-(9-alkyl)carbazolene, 4,7-(2-alkyl)benzo-2,1,3-triazolene, 10-alkyl-acrid-olene, wherein alkyl represents a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl group and alkoxy represents a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkoxyl group; or Y represents an arylene group, said arylene group being optionally substituted with one or more —CR11 groups or with one or more —COR11 groups wherein R11 represents a hydrogen atom, or a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl group, or with one or more linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl groups, or with one or more aryl groups;W represents an oxygen atom; a sulfur atom; an NR group wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, or a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl group;Z represents a sulfur atom; an oxygen atom; a selenium atom; an NR group wherein R represents a hydrogen atom, or a linear or branched C1-C30 preferably C6-C26, alkyl group;R4 and R5, the same or different from each other, represent a hydrogen atom; a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl group; a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkoxyl group; or, when m is 0, R4 and R5 can be optionally bound to each other to form, together with the carbon atoms to which they are bound, a condensed cycle containing from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 6, carbon atoms, saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms such as, for example, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, silicon, phosphorous, selenium, said condensed cycle being optionally substituted with one or more linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl groups, or with one or more linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkoxyl groups;R7 and R8, the same or different from each other, represent a hydrogen atom; a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl group; a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkoxyl group; a —CH2OR12 group wherein R12 represents a hydrogen atom, or a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl group; or, R7 and R8 can be optionally bound to each other to form, together with the carbon atoms to which they are bound, a condensed cycle containing from 3 to 14 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 6, carbon atoms, saturated, unsaturated or aromatic, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms such as, for example, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, silicon, phosphorous, selenium, said condensed cycle being optionally substituted with one or more linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkyl groups, or with one or more linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkoxyl groups;R9 and R10, the same or different from each other, represent a hydrogen atom; a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10 alkyl group; a linear or branched C1-C20, preferably C2-C10, alkoxyl group;m is 0, 1, or 2;n is an integer ranging from 10 to 500, preferably from 20 to 300; said process comprising reacting at least one disubstituted benzohetero[1,3]diazole compound having general formula (V): wherein X represents a halogen atom selected from chlorine, fluorine, bromine, iodine, preferably bromine, and Z, R1 and R2, have the same meanings described above; with at least one heteroaryl compound having general formula (VI), (VII), (VIII) or (IX): wherein W, Y, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10, have the same meanings described above For the purposes of the present description and of the following claims, the definitions of the numerical ranges always comprise the extremes unless otherwise specified.
