FIELD OF INVENTION The invention relates to a process for the preparation of Etravirine (formula-I) and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt for the treatment of HIV. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Etravirine, chemically known as 4-((6-amino-5-bromo-2-((4-cyanophenyl) amino) pyrimidin-4-yl) oxy)-3, 5-dimethylbenzonitrileis a pyrimidine derivative having Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) replication inhibiting properties. It was first disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,037,917 and the key step disclosed in the patent is presented in Scheme 1. STATE OF THE ART The following procedures are reported for the synthesis of etravirine. U.S. Pat. No. 7,037,917 describes the synthesis of compound of formula (I) and its salt. The process for etravrine comprises reacting 4-[[6-chloro-5-bromo-2[(4-cyanophenyl) amino]-4-pyrimidinyl]oxy-3, 5-dimethylbenzonitrile with ammonia. The process requires longer reaction times and also resulted poor yields in all stages. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. (2001, 11, 2235-2239) explains a process for the synthesis of etravirine and the synthesis involes the introduction of —NH2 group at the final stage of the synthesis. It required a high pressure and temperature for the introduction of amino group. The process also gave poor yields in the amination and phenoxide coupling reaction stages. Organic process Research and Development (2010, 14, 657-660) describes an improved process for the synthesis of etravirine. According to the process, the synthesis starts with trichloro pyrimidine and the main aspect of this route is the introduction of bromine at the final stage of the synthesis. This method suffers from the formation of an unwanted coupling product in the aminobenzonitrile coupling stage and it needs tedious work up procedures to remove the impurity. Due the formation of the impurity, the yield of the reaction was also very low. Process for the preparation of etravirine was described in WO 2010049952 and it describes the synthesis of etravirine through a novel. intermediate 4-((6-chloro-2-(4-cyanophenyl) amino)-4-pyrimidinyl)oxy-3,5-dimethylbenzonitrile and also reported novel crystalline forms of etravirine. In the reported synthesis, the yields obtained in some of the stages are very poor. It is clear from the above discussion that, an efficient and cost effective method for the synthesis of etravirine is needed to overcome the difficulties associated with the known art. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION The primary object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Etravirine. Another object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of 4-((4-amino-5-bromo-6-chloropyrimidin-2-yl) amino) benzonitrileis, a key intermediate for Etravirine synthesis. A further object of the invention is to provide pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the Etravirine for the treatment of HIV.
