Step 13 Synthesis of Compound 45
Compound 44 (542 mg, 1.67 mmol) was dissolved in THF (5.42 mL), and diethylamine (0.524 mL, 5.01 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (193 mg, 0.167 mmol) were added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (5 mL) was added to the residue. The reaction mixture was washed with ether, and 2 mol/L sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (5 mL) and saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution were added to the aqueous layer, followed by extraction with 10% methanol-chloroform five times. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to give Compound 45 (362 mg, Yield 90%) as a pale yellow oil.
