Example 18
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid (0.051 g, 0.448 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.431 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 48.5Â° C. for 4 days and the precipitation formed. After cooling, the solid was collected by filtration and washed with cold dichloromethane to give N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (0.099 g, 71%) as a green solid.
