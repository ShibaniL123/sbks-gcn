Preparation of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-3-amine
HCl in dioxane (4 M; 1.2 mL, 4.78 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of tert-butyl 3-((4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)amino)azetidine-1-carboxylate (296 mg, 0.48 mmol) in MeOH (3.5 ml). After stirring at room temperature overnight, the reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was dissolved in MeOH (2 mL). This solution was then loaded onto an SCX-2 ion-exchange cartridge that had been pretreated with methanol. The cartridge was washed with methanol and then 7N ammonia in methanol. Product fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure to afford N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-3-amine (181 mg, 87%) as a pale solid. m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 436.
