TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a base film, a laminated structure including the same, and a display device, and more particularly, to a base film that exhibits a high glass transition temperature and thus has excellent heat resistance, and has high light transmittance, a laminated structure including the same, and a display device. This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2013-0116560 filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) on Sep. 30, 2013, and Korean Patent Application No. 10-2014-0129369 filed with KIPO on Sep. 26, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF ART In general, a touch panel is a device that is installed on the surface of a display device and converts physical contact such as a finger of a user, a touch pen, and the like into an electrical signal, and is applied for a liquid crystal display, a plasma display panel, an EL (electro-luminescence) device, and the like. Such a touch panel is commercialized as an optical type using infrared rays, a transparent electrode type using a contact point of a transparent conductive film formed by coating a metal oxide on a polymer substrate film, a capacitance type detecting a change in capacity, a position sensitive type that senses a position from the distribution of force to a pressure sensor, and the like. Among the various types of touch panels, a transparent electrode type requires a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film, and an ITO film formed by coating indium tin oxide (ITO) on a polymer substrate film is widely used because it is transparent and has excellent conductivity. Particularly, the metal oxide-based conductive film may be prepared by vacuum deposition or sputtering a metal oxide on a polymer substrate film or a glass substrate. Thus, heat resistance is one of essential properties of a base film, because processes such as vacuum deposition, sputtering, and the like that are progressed at a high temperature should be conducted. In general, heat resistance may be assessed by glass transition temperature, and to obtain a base film on which an optically excellent transparent metal oxide-based conductive film is formed, sputtering at a temperature of equal to or greater than about 150° C., preferably at a temperature of equal to or greater than about 200° C., is required, and thus a high glass transition temperature above the sputtering temperature and excellent mechanical properties are required for the base film. Further, in order to process the base film and apply it to a display device and the like, transparency in the visible light region is also an important property in addition to the above-explained high glass transition temperature, and light transmittance of 90% or more is required. However, a polymer film such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polycarbonate (PC), and the like, which is conventionally used as a base film, has a low glass transition temperature of 120° C. or less, thus generating a problem of deformation in the process of forming a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film. In addition, a polyimide (PI) film, on which many studies have recently being progressed due to its excellent heat resistance and high glass transition temperature of 400° C. or more, but is not transparent and shows an orange color, and thus is not suitable for application in the display field. Further, since a polymer film such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and the like has a large phase difference, it can be used as an external base film, but cannot be used as an internal base film. Accordingly, there is a demand for development of a base film that has properties of a high glass transition temperature, heat resistance, and the like, has small a phase difference, and is transparent, a laminated structure including the same, and a display device including the laminated structure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Technical Problem It is an object of the invention to provide a base film that exhibits a high glass transition temperature and thus has excellent heat resistance, and has high light transmittance. It is another object of the invention to provide a laminated structure including the base film. It is still another object of the invention to provide a display device including the laminated structure. Technical Solution The present invention provides a base film including: a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit; and a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit, wherein the content of exo-isomers in the cyclic olefin-based repeat unit is 50 mol % or more, and a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film is formed on the base film. The present invention also provides a laminated structure including the base film, and a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film formed on the base film. The present invention also provides a display device including the laminated structure. Hereinafter, a base film, a laminated structure including the same, and a display device according to specific embodiments of the invention will be explained in detail. According to one embodiment of the invention, a base film is provided, including: a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit; and a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit, wherein the content of exo-isomers in the cyclic olefin-based repeat unit is 50 mol % or more, and a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film is formed on the base film. In the base film, the cyclic olefin-based repeat unit may be represented by the following Formula 1, and the polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit may include a homopolymer prepared by addition polymerization of one kind of norbornene-based monomers represented by the following Chemical Formula 2, or a copolymer prepared by addition polymerization of two or more kinds thereof In the Chemical Formulae 1 and 2, q is an integer of 0 to 4, m is 50 to 5000, R1 to R4 are independently a polymer functional group or a non-polar functional group, or at least one combination selected from the group consisting of R1 and R2, and R3 and R4 may be connected to each other to form a C1-10 alkylidene group, or R1 or R2 may be connected with one of R3 and R4 to form a C4-12 saturated or unsaturated aliphatic ring or a C6-24 aromatic ring. The inventors progressed studies on a base film that has properties of high glass transition temperature, heat resistance, transparency, and the like, and can be applied in the field of displays, particularly as a base film including a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film formed on the top, and confirmed through experiments that if a base film includes a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit and a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit, and the content of exo-isomers in the cyclic olefin-based repeat unit is 50 mol % or more, a film that has a high glass transition temperature and exhibits high light transmittance in the visible light region may be prepared, and completed the invention. Particularly, the base film includes a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit, for example, a norbornene-based repeat unit, thus exhibiting a high glass transition temperature, and includes 50 mol % or more of exo-isomers in the cyclic olefin-based repeat unit, thus exhibiting high light transmittance and transparency. The base film includes a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit together with the polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit, thus lowering a phase difference in the thickness direction. The base film of one embodiment may include 50 mol % or more, or 50 to 100 mol %, of exo-isomers in the cyclic olefin-based repeat unit. The exo-isomers in the cyclic olefin-based repeat unit are characterized in that the molecular weight and yield increase when polymerized, the removal of a catalyst after a reaction is easy, and particularly, a remaining catalyst amount is low and thus heat resistance is excellent, and has high solubility in a solvent, and thus a base film including an excessive amount of exo-isomers compared to endo-isomers may exhibit high heat resistance and high transparency. The polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit may have a weight average molecular weight of about 10,000 to 1,000,000, preferably about 200,000 to 500,000. The repeat unit of the Chemical Formula 1 making up the polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit may have a polymerization degree of about 30 to 5000, preferably about 300 to 1500. The base film of one embodiment may include a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit, and the copolymer may include 1 to 50 wt %, preferably 5 to 20 wt %, of the styrene-based repeat units. The copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit may inhibit lamination of molecules in the thickness direction, thus lowering a phase difference in the thickness direction while maintaining a phase difference in the plane direction. Particularly, since it appears that the styrene-based repeat unit in the copolymer performs a function for controlling the phase difference of the copolymer, if the content of the styrene-based repeat units in the copolymer is too small, the above-explained effect may not be sufficiently manifested. The copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit may have a weight average molecular weight of about 500 to 1,000,000. Further, the polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit and the copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit may be mixed at a weight ratio of 99:1 to 50:50, and preferably at a weight ratio of 90:10 to 70:30.

The base film according to one embodiment including a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit, and a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit, may have a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 250° C. or more, about 250 to about 450° C., about 250 to 400° C., or about 300 to about 350° C. That is, the base film is an amorphous polymer with a hard and bulky ring structure in all the monomer units of the main chain, and thus is structurally hard. The base film includes 50 mol % or more of exo-isomers in the cyclic olefin-based repeat units, and thus exhibits a glass transition temperature of about 250° C. or more, preferably a high glass transition temperature of about 250 to 450° C., thereby exhibiting superior thermal stability compared to the previously known base films such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polycarbonate (PC), and the like. The base film may have light transmittance of 90% or more at a wavelength region of about 400 to 800 nm. Since the base film of one embodiment includes a cyclic olefin-based polymer obtained by addition polymerization using a homogeneous catalyst and thus has a hard and bulky ring structure in all the monomer units of the main chain, it does not generate optical loss due to scattering, and has small light absorption in the visible light region due to i-conjugation, thus exhibiting high light transmittance. Particularly, the base film has a low dielectric constant, electrically excellent isotropy, and a small phase difference (Rth) in the thickness direction, and thus it may be applied for a base film of the inside as well as the outside, when used for a display device. The base film may have a thickness of 20 to 200 μm, and preferably 20 to 60 μm. The transparent metal oxide-based conductive film formed on the top of the base film of one embodiment may be an ITO film, an ATO film, an IZO (indium zinc oxide) film, an indium film, a tin oxide film, a zinc oxide film, a titanium oxide film, an antimony oxide film, and the like. The transparent metal oxide-based conductive film may be formed, for example, by sputtering at a high temperature, but the kind and the preparation method are not limited thereto. The base film may be used for a base of an ITO film for a touch panel or a base of a display device. The base film may be prepared using commonly known constituents and preparation methods of a film, except including a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit and a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit as explained above. For example, 10 to 30 wt % of the polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit and the copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit, and the remaining amount of solvent, are mixed to prepared a coating solution, which is casted on a mirror surface-polished substrate such as metal or glass using a knife coater or a bar coater, and then the solvent is dried to prepare a base film. The drying temperature may be selected according to the kind of solvent used, and the surface temperature of the mirror surface-polished substrate such as metal or glass may be preferably below room temperature. The solvent is not specifically limited, and for example, it may include cyclic saturated hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, and the like; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and the like; halogenated alkanes or halogenated aryls such as chlorobutane, bromohexane, chloromethylene, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, chloroform, tetrachloroethylene, and the like; saturated carboxylic acid esters such as ethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, methyl propionate, and the like; ethers such as dibutylether, tetrahydrofuran, and the like; and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and the like, which may be used alone or in combination. Alkanes such as pentane, hexane, octane, nonane, decane, and the like may be additionally mixed with the solvent and used. According to another embodiment of the invention, a laminated structure including the above explained base film, and a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film formed on the base film, are provided. As explained above, since the base film includes a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit and a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit, includes 50 mol % or more of exo-isomers in the cyclic olefin-based repeat unit and thus has high glass transition temperature, and exhibits high light transmittance in the visible light region, the laminated structure including the base film and a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film may exhibit excellent heat resistance and transparency, and may be applied for a display device and the like. Those described with regard to the base film of one embodiment may be applied to the base film and the transparent metal oxide-based conductive film formed on the base film without limitations. According to yet another embodiment of the invention, a display device including the above-explained laminated structure is provided. As explained above, since the laminated structure including a base film and a transparent metal oxide-based conductive film includes a polymer having a specific repeat unit and a copolymer including a styrene repeat unit and a maleimide repeat unit, and includes 50 mol % or more of exo-isomers in the specific repeat unit and thus exhibits excellent heat resistance and transparency, it may be appropriately applied for a display device. Since the construction of the display device is identical to the common construction of a device except for including a base film including a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit and a copolymer including a styrene-based repeat unit and a maleimide-based repeat unit as explained above, detailed explanations thereof are omitted. Advantageous Effects According to the present invention, a base film that exhibits a high glass transition temperature and thus has excellent heat resistance, and has high light transmittance, a laminated structure including the same, and a display device are provided.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS The present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the following examples. However, these examples are only to illustrate the invention, and the scope of the invention is not limited thereto. EXAMPLES AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES Preparation of a Cyclic Olefin-Based Polymer and a Base Film Example 1 (1) Preparation of a Cyclic Olefin-Based Polymer 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid butyl ester (100 g) with an exo ratio of 71 mol % and 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (900 g) with an exo ratio of 71 mol % were introduced into a reactor at room temperature, and toluene (3000 g) was put therein. 1-octyne (10.8 g) was additionally put in the reactor, the inside of the reactor was replaced with nitrogen, and then the temperature of the reactor was raised to 105° C. Subsequently, a catalyst of palladium acetate trimer (0.288 g) and tricyclohexyl phosphonium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl) borate (2.46 g) were dissolved in a dichloromethane solvent, which was then introduced into the reactor, and reacted for 18 hours while stirring. After the reaction for 18 hours, a white polymer precipitate was obtained using acetone and ethanol. The precipitate was filtered with a filter to recover a polymer, which was dried in a vacuum oven at 60° C. for 24 hours to prepare a copolymer of 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid butyl ester and 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester. (2) Preparation of a Base Film 80 wt % of the copolymer of 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid butyl ester and 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester obtained in (1) and 20 wt % of a styrene-maleimide copolymer having a maleimide monomer content of 15 wt % were mixed and dissolved in a methylene chloride (MC) solvent such that the solid content became 20 wt %. The solution was cleanly filtered using a filter having 0.45 μm pores to prepare a coating solution. The coating solution was casted on a glass substrate using a knife coater or a bar coater, and then dried at room temperature for 1 hour, and dried again at 100° C. for 1 hour under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the drying, it was immersed in water for 30 seconds, and then a film on the glass substrate was delaminated to obtain a transparent film with a uniform thickness having a thickness deviation of less than 2%. The thickness, light transmittance at 400 to 800 nm, and glass transition temperature of the prepared film are shown in the following Table 1.

(1) Measurement of Phase Difference The phase difference of each base film obtained in the examples was measured using Axoscan (manufactured by Axomatrix Co. Ltd.), and the thickness of the film was measured together. Herein, a phase difference in the plane direction is represented by Re, a phase difference when the angle between incident light and the film side is 50° is represented by Rθ, and a phase difference between the film thickness direction and the y-axis in the plane is represented by Rth. R th = R θ × cos   θ f sin 2   θ f 〈 Mathematical   Equation   1 〉 In the Mathematical Equation 1, Rth denotes a phase difference in the thickness direction, and θf denotes an internal angle. (2) Measurement of Light Transmittance The light transmittance of each base film obtained in the examples and comparative examples was measured using a haze meter. (3) Measurement of Haze The haze of each base film obtained in the examples and comparative examples was measured using a haze meter. (4) Measurement of Refractive Index The refractive index of each base film obtained in the examples and comparative examples was measured using a prism coupler. (5) Measurement of Glass Transition Temperature The glass transition temperature of each base film obtained in the examples and comparative examples was measured using a TMA (thermal mechanical analyzer), wherein the on-set point of the film according to temperature was confirmed.

The phase difference and the refractive index of the films of the comparative examples could not be measured because the transparencies of the films were too low. Further, the base film prepared in the examples exhibited a low phase difference in the thickness direction (Rth) per unit μm, and thus it can be applied for a base film of the inside as well as the outside, when used for a display device. Experimental Example 2 Assessment of Adhesive Strength The base films prepared in Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 were respectively coated on a COP, and then the adhesive strength was tested by attaching a 3M tape to the base film and instantaneously detaching it, and then confirming the state of the film. The photographs of the base films of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 after the adhesion test are respectively shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 1, the base films including a polymer having a cyclic olefin-based repeat unit with the exo-isomer content of 50 mol % or more according to the examples of the present invention were hardly delaminated in the adhesion test, thus exhibiting good adhesive strength. To the contrary, referring to FIG. 2, in the base films with the exo-isomer content of less than 50 mol % according to comparative examples, a lot delamination of the base film from the COP film occurred, thus exhibiting inferior adhesive strength. 1.
