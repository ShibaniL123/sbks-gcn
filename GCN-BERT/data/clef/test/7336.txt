LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES Nandina domestica VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘TWILIGHT’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new cultivar is a product of chance discovery by the inventor. This new variety, hereinafter referred to as ‘TWILIGHT’, was discovered as a naturally occurring, whole plant mutation by the inventor, Neil Marek. The interesting new mutation was discovered in a commercial laboratory in Magnolia, Tex. among a population of Nandina domestica ‘Gulf Stream’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 5656 during May of 2010. After identifying the new variety as a potentially interesting selection, the inventor first organized propagation of ‘TWILIGHT’ by tissue culture at the same commercial laboratory during May of 2010. The inventor continued controlled testing and propagation, assessing stability of the unique characteristics of this variety. At least five generations have been reproduced and have shown that the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The cultivar ‘TWILIGHT’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘TWILIGHT’ These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘TWILIGHT’ as a new and distinct Nandina cultivar: 1. Unique color change of foliage: Youngest new foliage is pink, with white variegation.Older immature foliage is bright green with pink and white variation.Mature foliage is green with white variegation, eventually changing to solid green.2. Pink petiole and stem coloration of new growth. COMPARISON TO PARENT VARIETY ‘TWILIGHT’ is similar in most horticultural characteristics to the parent variety Nandina domestica ‘Gulf Stream’, including plant habit. Plants of the new cultivar ‘TWILIGHT’ however, produce unique variegated foliage, which changes color during the seasons, whereas the parent variety has foliage without variegation. Additionally, stem color of the new growth is different in the new variety. COMMERCIAL COMPARISON ‘TWILIGHT’ can be compared to the commercial variety Nandina domestica ‘Seika’ U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,891. Plants of the new cultivar ‘TWILIGHT’ are similar to plants of ‘Seika’ in most horticultural characteristics. Plants of the new cultivar ‘TWILIGHT’ however, produce unique variegated foliage, which changes color during the seasons, whereas ‘Seika’ has foliage without variegation. Additionally, stem color of the new growth is different in the new variety. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photograph in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color a typical plant of ‘TWILIGHT’ grown outdoors in Magnolia, Tex. The plant is approximately 1.5 years old, and is shown in a three gallon container. FIG. 2 shows a close up of typical foliage of the new variety. FIG. 3 illustrates flowering panicles. The photographs were taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques.
