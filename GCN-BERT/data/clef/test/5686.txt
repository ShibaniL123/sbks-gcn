Step 3: preparation of intermediate 1-tert-butyl ester 2-methyl ester (2S,4S,5S)-5-allyloxyamino-4-(tert-butyl-dimethyl-silanyloxy)-piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (2c)
To a solution of 1-tert-butyl ester 2-methyl ester (2S,4S,5S)-5-allyloxyamino-4-hydroxy-piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (2b) (3.95 g, 11.97 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (50 mL) under inert atmosphere at 0°C was added 2,6-lutidine (1.67 mL, 14.36 mmol) followed by TBDMSOTf (2.88 mL, 12.58 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 3 h at 20°C and then the solution was extracted with DCM, washed with saturated sodium hydrogenocarbonate aqueous solution. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. The product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc 90/10) to afford 1-tert-butyl ester 2-methyl ester (2S,4S,5S)-5-allyloxyamino-4-(tert-butyl-dimethyl-silanyloxy)-piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (2c) (4.55 g, 10.23 mmol, 85%) as a colorless oil.
