Example 4. Preparation of SM-4: 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(aminopropylisobutylPOSS)ethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride
A 50 ml flask was charged with CH2Cl2 (15 ml) under nitrogen stream at 0° C. and then 2-(fluorosulfonyl)difluoroacetyl fluoride (5.22 g, 29.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) was added and the mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at 0° C. A CH2Cl2 (55 ml) solution of the mixture of aminopropylisobutylPOSS® (POSS-1, 12.7 g, 14.5 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and pyridine (1.15 g, 14.5 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to this mixture over 40 minutes. The resulting mixture was stirred for 4 hours at 0° C. CH2Cl2 (70 ml) and 1N HCl (40 ml) were added to the final reaction mixture and then the lower layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (20 ml×2) and brine (20 ml×2). This solution was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtrated and then the CH2Cl2 was removed in an evaporator. The targeted compound was obtained as white solid (14.4 g, 96.2% yield).
