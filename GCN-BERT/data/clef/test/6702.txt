STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX Not applicable FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method of providing a replacement for a patient's hip with a minimal loss of blood, minimal tissue trauma and a minimal length of operating time and patient recovery time. The invention also relates to a tool which is needed in the method constituting this invention. BACKGROUND OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION Great progress has been made in the field of hip replacements. Considering that hip replacements may not even have existed a generation ago, hip replacements, particularly among the elderly, are now relatively common. In spite of the considerable progress which has been made, hip replacement operations are still relatively crude. For example, an incision of a relatively great length still has to be made in a patient's hip as one of the first steps in a hip replacement operation. The incision may be as long as approximately eight inches (8″) to approximately twelve inches (12″). Such a large incision has caused patients to lose large amounts of blood and to suffer significant trauma. It has caused the length of the operation and the patient recovery time to be relatively long. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION A minimal length main incision (e.g., approximately 1½″-3″ long) and two portal incisions (each significantly less than 1″ long) strategically displaced from the main incisions are provided in a patient's hip. A cannula is inserted through the portal incision to the acetabulum and a shaft is inserted through the cannula. A reamer is disposed through the main incision in the acetabulum and coupled to the shaft to ream the acetabulum when the shaft is rotated. Reamers of progressive size are then coupled to the shaft to progressively shape and size a socket in the acetabulum. An approximately hemispherical acetabular component is then disposed in the acetabulum to provide for hip rotation relative to the femur. The other portal (femoral portal) incision provides for a preparation of an insertion of a member into the patient's hip for preparing a femoral canal and then driving the' femoral stem into a cavity in the patient's femur. The provision of the main incision and the portal incision.s minimizes the patient's loss of blood, tissue trauma, length of operating time and patient recovery time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. FIGS. 1-15 show progressive steps in performing a method constituting a preferred embodiment of the invention and also show apparatus included in the patentable features of the preferred embodiment of this invention. FIG. 1 schematically shows a patient's hip 10 and also shows a main incision 12 and a pair of portal incisions 14 and 16 may be an acetabular portal incision, may be on one side of the main incision and may be significantly less than one half inch (½″) in length. As indicated in FIGS. 5-8 and 10-11, and as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the position of the acetabular portal incision 16 is selected to provide access to the acetabulum 22 in cooperation with the main incision 12 but without providing access to the patient's acetabulum 22 through the patient's femoral neck. The incision 14 may be a femoral incision, may be on the other side of the main incision 12 from the acetabular incision 16 and may also be significantly less than one half inch (½″) in length. The portal incisions 14 and 16 may be of the same approximate length. A tool generally indicated at 18 is shown in FIG. 2. The tool 18 may illustratively be used to locate the position of the portal incision 16. The tool 18 includes a positioning member 20 which may preferably have a hemispherical configuration to fit in an acetabulum 22 (FIG. 4) when the position of the acetabular portal incision 16 is being determined. A looped extension portion 24 extends from the positioning member 20. The portion 24 is preferably looped to extend through the main incision 12 to a position external to the patient's hip 10 and then to extend to a position approximating the position of the acetabular portal incision 16. It will be appreciated that the looped portion 24 may have a different configuration than that shown in FIG. 2 provided that the right end in FIG. 2 has a position corresponding substantially to that shown in FIG. 2. A marker member 26 such as a stylus attached to the looped portion at the right end of the looped portion 24 in FIG. 2. The marker member 26 is retained by a holder 28. As will be seen, the holder 28 and the marker member 26 have a substantially identical axial relationship with the positioning member 20. A first step in the performance of applicant's method is shown in FIG. 3. In this step, a cutter 30 is used to provide the main incision 12. This incision is preferably made anterior to, directly over or posterior to the greater trochanter. It will accordingly be appreciated that the positioning of the main incision 12 is somewhat discretionary. FIG. 4 is a somewhat schematic view showing the approximate positioning of the main incision 12 relative to the positioning of the patient's hip bone 32 and femur 34. FIG. 5 shows the hip bone 32 and the acetabulum 22 in the hip bone. FIG. 5 shows the disposition of the tool 18 with the positioning member 20 in the acetabulum 22. In this disposition, the marker member 26 abuts the patient's skin 36 in the region of the patient's hip and causes a mark 38 to be produced on the patient's skin. This mark indicates the position to be provided for the acetabular portal incision 16. FIG. 6 illustrates the positioning of a cannula 40 so that extends through the acetabular incision 16 at the mark 38 in the direction toward the axis of the positioning member 20. As indicated in FIGS. 5-8 and 10-11, and as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the cannula 40 communicates between the acetabular portal incision 16 and the acetabulum 22 without passing through the patient's femoral neck. FIG. 7 shows a shaft 42 extending through the cannula 40 and coupled to a reamer 44 which is disposed in the acetabulum 22. A motor 46 drives the shaft in one rotary direction to operate the reamer 44. The rotary movement of the shaft 42 is indicated at 48. As will be appreciated, the acetabulum 22 is sequentially reamed by reamers 44 of progressively increasing size. This is illustrated at 44a in FIG. 7 and at 44a and 44b in FIG. 8. It may also be seen by comparing the size of the reamers 44a and 44b respectively in FIGS. 7 and 10 and also in FIG. 8. When the acetabulum 22 has the desired shape, size and smoothness, a hemispherical shell (acetabular component or a trial component) 45 (FIG. 11) is introduced into the acetabulum 22 to provide a pivotal relationship with the femoral head. This may be accomplished by applying a mallet 50 to the shaft extending thru the cannula 40 as illustrated schematically at 50 in FIG. 11. FIGS. 12-15 relate to the formation of the femoral portal incision 14 and the use of this incision in connection with the disposition of the femoral stem 52 in a cavity 54 (FIG. 15) in the femur 34. As shown in FIG. 12, a tool generally indicated at 56 is provided to determine the position of the femoral portal incision 14. The tool 56 is similar in a number of respects to the tool 18. For example, the tool 56 may include an extension portion 58 and a marker member 60 respectively corresponding in configuration to the extension portion 24 and the marker member 26 in FIG. 2. The dimensions of the extension portion 58 may be different from those of the extension portion 24. The tool 56 may also be provided with a drive member 62 at the end opposite the marker member 60. The drive member 62 may have a finger configuration. The marker member 60 and the drive member 62 preferably are disposed on the same axis. When the drive member 62 is inserted into the main incision 12 and is disposed against the femoral stem 52, the marker member 60 makes a mark 63 a long scalpel blade may be passed thru this portal locator sleeve to indicate the position of the femoral portal incision 14 as shown in FIG. 12. A relatively long scalpel blade may then be passed through this portal locator sleeve. A cannula 64 (FIG. 13) is then inserted through the femoral portal incision 14 to a position adjacent the femoral stem 32. If soft tissues permit, a cannula need not always be used. A rasp 66 or, a reamer, a drill or a tamp is passed through the cannula 64 into the cavity 54 in the femur 34 and is operated to prepare the walls of the cavity to receive the femur. In the claims, the term “rasp” is intended to include a reamer, drill or tamp or other suitable component. The rasp 66, or, a reamer, a drill or a tamp is then withdrawn from the cannula 64 and a drive member 68 (FIG. 14) is inserted through the cannula to abut the femoral stem. This is shown in FIG. 14. A mallet 70 in FIG. 15 is then applied against the drive member 68 to move the femoral stem 52 into the cavity 54 in the femur 34. This is shown in FIG. 15. Although the present invention has been described in terms of specific embodiments, it is anticipated that alterations and modifications thereof will no doubt become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is therefore intended that the following claims be interpreted as covering all alterations and modifications that fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. 1-62. (canceled) 63.
