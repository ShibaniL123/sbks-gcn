No. 13/823,811, filed Mar. 15, 2013. The present application also claims right of priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/623,110 filed Apr. 12, 2012. BACKGROUND Non-specific primer extension prior to reaction initiation in thermocycling DNA amplification reactions such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or isothermal DNA amplification reactions such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) may inhibit specific product formation, and lead to non-specific amplification and reaction irreproducibility. It is, therefore, desirable to block the activity of the polymerase, and hence primer extension, prior to reaction initiation. This has been achieved using antibodies (Kellogg, et al., Biotechniques, 16(6):1134-7 (1994)), affybodies (Affibody AB, Stockholm, Sweden), aptamers (Dang, et al., Journal of Molecular Biology, 264(2):268-78 (1996)), and chemical modification of the polymerase (U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,998). Although each of these techniques can be effective, they each have unique limitations. For example, preparation of antibodies requires use of animal systems, affybodies and aptamers require screening libraries of molecular variants, and chemical modifications require extra heat incubation steps to reverse the inactivating modification. It would be desirable to have a generalizable approach to rapidly and effectively create hot-start inhibitors targeted towards DNA polymerases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS Synthetic nucleic acids/oligonucleotides are described that reversibly inhibit DNA binding enzyme reactions. These synthetic nucleic acid preferably contain at least one non-standard and/or modified base in a 5′ single-strand overhang adjacent to a double-strand region. If the double-strand region is denatured into a single-strand or strands, the synthetic nucleic acid no longer blocks the DNA binding enzyme from reacting with substrate DNA. Preferably, inhibition of the DNA binding enzyme activity occurs at a first temperature that is at least 10° C. lower than a second temperature suitable for enzyme reactions. Where the DNA enzyme is a polymerase, a polymerase extension reaction refers to the extension of a first single-strand nucleic acid by a polymerase where the extension is complementary to a second nucleic acid in association with the first strand. The term “Tm” refers to a computer predicted 50% denaturation temperature for a double stranded nucleic acid based on nucleotide sequence composition. Examples of computer based predictors include UnaFold (Integrated DNA technologies Coralville, Iowa) and Mfold Webserver, (The RNA Institute, College of Arts and Sciences, University of Albany, State University of NY). In an embodiment, a synthetic nucleic acid is engineered so that the double-strand region has a Tm at a desired temperature for degeneration at about 15° C. or 14° C. or 13° C. or 12° C. or 11° C. or 10° C. or 9° C. or 8° C. below DNA binding enzyme reaction conditions. Where the DNA binding enzyme is a polymerase, the conditions of the reaction, namely polymerase extension reaction conditions include conditions for isothermal amplification occurring at for example 65° C. or a thermocycling amplification such as PCR which occurs at higher temperatures such as about 95° C. The DNA binding protein may be a product of fusion to a DNA binding domain. Additional the DNA binding protein may be fused to a protein moiety other than a DNA binding domain, wherein the second protein moiety may be associated with solubility, e.g. maltose binding protein (MBP) or purification such as MBP or chitin binding domain (CBD). Preferably, the double-strand region in the synthetic nucleic acid is designed to remain intact at a specific temperature in the range of −80° C. to 37° C. but become denatured at a specific temperature which exceeds the temperature at which it remains intact where the denaturation temperature is in a range of 37° C. to 100° C. The Tm of the synthetic nucleic acid can be modulated by one or more factors that include: changing the sequence or length of the double-strand region, changing the length of an internal single-strand region, adding mismatched, non-standard and/or modified bases to the double-strand region, selecting a nucleotide composition having weaker base pairing properties such as an adenine, thymine or uracil rich sequence, and having a sequence containing inosine, or abasic sites such as 1′,2′ dideoxyribose in a polymerization reaction buffer with a selected salt type (for example magnesium) and concentration. An example of a polymerization reaction buffer is Thermopol® Buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.). In an embodiment of the invention, the design of a synthetic nucleic acid reversible inhibitor of polymerase extension reactions includes the following features: the synthetic nucleic acid can be DNA, DNA/RNA, RNA, or RNA/RNA; it can be formed from two single-strands or from a single nucleic acid (oligonucleotide) but should be capable of forming a molecule or a plurality of molecules comprising at least one double-strand region and a 5′ single-strand overhang. The synthetic nucleic acid inhibitor may optionally contain a plurality of single-strand regions and a plurality of double-strand regions. If the synthetic nucleic acid inhibitor is an oligonucleotide, it should be capable of folding in such a way as to contain at least one double-strand region at a temperature lower than the reaction temperature as described above. The oligonucleotide may have a length in the range of 8-200 nucleotides. Any double-strand region in the inhibitor preferably has a length of 4-35 nucleotides. The term “Modified nucleotide” refers to any of ATGC with an additional chemical group attached to the nucleotide such as a methyl, hydroxymethyl, formyl or carboxy group. It includes a non-standard and/or modified nucleotide such as for example might be observed in damaged DNA such as 8-oxo-G or Uracil or to an unnatural synthetic nucleotide such as benzylguanine. The 5′ single-strand region such as an overhang should be at least 4 nucleotides and preferably less than 100 nucleotides in length, for example 4-40 nucleotides, for example 6-10 nucleotides, and should contain one or more non-standard and/or modified nucleotides such as U or I positioned between the second and tenth position of the overhang counted from the double-strand region, for example in the fourth position where the one or more non-standard and/or modified nucleotides may be 1 to 5 uracils or 1 to 5 inosines. For example, the sequences shown in Table 1 were all found to be effective as reversible binding oligonucleotides. In addition, a synthetic nucleic acid may optionally have a 3′ end that is resistant to exonuclease activity and/or non-extendable by a polymerase. The 3′ end of the oligonucleotide can be blocked from extension by modification, such as dideoxynucleotides, spacer molecules, inverted bases or amino-modified nucleotides. The 3′ end can be made resistant to exonuclease degradation by the addition of phosphorothioate linkages between one or more bases at or near the 3′ end or the use of inverted bases at the 3′ end. The oligonucleotide can be made non-amplifiable by adding non-replicable bases in the internal sequence, such as carbon spacers, 1′,2′-Dideoxyribose, abasic site, or thymine dimers. Table 1 provides examples of synthetic nucleic acid molecules capable of forming hairpins and that were found to be effective in the assays described herein. The exemplified synthetic nucleic acid molecules have spacers of Tn or Xn where T(4-9) or X(1-4), a 5′ end containing a modified base, U(1-5), or I(1-3) and has a U or an I at position 4 counted from the double-stranded region. The 5′ end varies as shown.

Examples of DNA binding enzymes include: DNAses, TET, endonucleases, exonucleases, glycosylases and polymerases. The design of the oligonucleotide inhibitor is intended to inhibit the enzyme activity unless the oligonucleotide is denatured by temperature or chemical agent under conditions that do not inactivate the DNA binding enzyme in which case, the inhibition is reversed. In one embodiment, the DNA enzyme may be a polymerase. Examples of polymerases include thermostable polymerases such as wild type or recombinant Archaeal DNA polymerases or bacterial DNA polymerases or variants (mutants) thereof including fusion proteins where the polymerase or variants thereof may be fused to a DNA binding domain such as Sso7d (for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,666,645). A variant of a bacterial polymerase is exemplified at least 90%, 91%, 92% 93%, 95%, or 98% amino acid sequence homology or identity with SEQ ID NO:25 prior to fusion to a DNA binding domain if such is present. Regardless of the presence of an additional DNA binding domain, the variant preferably includes one or more mutations at positions corresponding to 52 (not R), 278, 307, 402, and/or 578 (not R) in SEQ ID NO:25, for example, one or more of the following mutations: H278Q, H307R, H402Q. Additional mutations may be optionally introduced into the polymerase by routine methods of random or directed mutagenesis. The examples demonstrate this effect with an oligonucleotide used together with an archael polymerase which is inhibited by the oligonucleotide until the temperature is raised to a level at which the oligonucleotide is denatured and the polymerase is active. Amplification procedures referred to herein include standard thermocycling or isothermal amplification reactions such as PCR amplification or LAMP (Gill, et al., Nucleos. Nucleot.

Example Assay to Measure Inhibition of Polymerase Activity Prior to PCR Cycling Inhibition of polymerase activity was measured at a temperature below that used in the PCR assay which followed. The assay was performed as follows: Primers were made for PCR to produce a 2 kb Lambda DNA amplicon. Additionally, the 3′ end of the reverse primer contained 8 nucleotides that could anneal to Lambda DNA creating a false priming site producing a non-specific 737 bp amplicon. The PCR assay was done in the presence of high levels of human genomic DNA and the reaction mixture was incubated with the thermostable polymerase at 25° C. for 15 minutes prior to PCR cycling. These conditions created many opportunities to form non-specific products. The presence of a nucleic acid composition to inhibit polymerase activity prior to amplification was required to yield a 2 kb amplicon, with minimal or no non-specific products. The reaction mix was set up on ice and contained the following reagents: Thermopol Buffer, 0.4 pg/μl Lambda DNA, 2.0 ng/μl Jurkat genomic DNA, 0.2 mM dNTP and 0.2 μM primers.

DNA products generated by PCR cycling were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In the absence of a reversibly inhibiting synthetic nucleic acid, the polymerase failed to yield the expected 2 kb Lamda amplicon. Non-specific products including the 737 bp amplicon were observed. In the presence of oligonucleotide inhibitors, a robust yield of the expected 2 kb Lambda amplicon was produced with minimal or no non-specific products. 1.
