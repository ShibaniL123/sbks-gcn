RELATED APPLICATIONS N/A FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to caskets, and more particularly to mechanisms for attaching ornaments to caskets, urns, and other funerary articles. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known to attach decorative ornaments to caskets to “personalize” the casket to the deceased. Examples of mechanisms for attaching generally three-dimensional “figurine” style ornaments to the exterior of a casket, for example to the corners of the casket shell, are shown in, for example, the assignee's U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,591,466, 6,928,706, 7,340,810 and 7,591,052, and US Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0077579, all hereby incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth in their entireties. The casket corner ornaments of the '466, '706, and '810 patents, and the '579 publication, utilize fasteners with heads, for example shoulder screws, mounted on the rear side of the ornament, the heads of which are secured in keyhole slots, for example L-shaped keyhole slots, in the casket shell corners. These ornaments are commercially available from the assignee as its LIFESYMBOLS® line of casket shell corner ornaments. Examples of mechanisms for attaching ornaments to the interior of a casket, for example to the cap panel mounted in the underneath side of the head end casket cap, are shown in, for example, the assignee's US Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0299895, hereby incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth in its entirety. One embodiment of the ornaments for attachment to the cap panel disclosed in the '895 publication utilizes one or more magnets mounted on the rear side of a generally two-dimensional “medallion” style ornament (a relatively thin, flat, circular medal, for example) for magnetically attaching the medallion to a magnetic cap panel. These ornaments are commercially available from the assignee as its LIFESTORIES® line of casket cap panel medallions. It was desirable to be able to utilize the medallion ornaments with magnets thereon with the casket shell L-shaped keyhole slots so that the medallions could also be mounted on the casket shell corners. To that end, a casket ornament attachment mechanism of the type shown in the assignee's US Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0266423, hereby incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth in its entirety, was devised. The '423 publication discloses a medallion casket ornament having at least one magnet mounted on the rear side thereof, and a magnetic adapter plate having at least one fastener with a head thereon mounted on the rear side thereof. The adapter plate is removably secured to the casket shell by inserting the head of the fastener in the keyhole groove of the casket shell and seating the head of the fastener in the keyhole groove. The casket ornament is then removably magnetically secured to the shell by positioning the magnet of the ornament on the adapter plate. It was also desirable to be able to use the casket corner ornaments having fasteners with heads on magnetic cap panels. To that end, the assignee devised a conversion kit for supply to funeral directors for converting a casket shell corner compatible ornament into a magnetic cap panel compatible ornament. That conversion kit comprised of two magnets and two Phillips screws. Each magnet has a bore for accepting its screw. To convert the casket corner ornament, the two shoulder screws (that cooperate with the L-shaped keyhole slots in the casket shell corner) are removed, and each is replaced with one of the magnets and one of the Phillips screws. The casket corner ornament can then be attached to a magnetic cap panel for display. While the above-described casket ornament attachment mechanism of the '423 publication and conversion kit both function as designed, nevertheless they are not without drawbacks. For example, the funeral director or funeral home owner must keep on hand several adapter plates and conversion kits, at extra cost. Each conversion kit, while separately packaged, nevertheless includes four fairly small parts which are readily lost, misplaced, etc. And, the act of converting casket corner compatible ornaments into magnetic cap panel compatible ornaments with conversion kits is time consuming. Accordingly, it is further desirable to devise a single or universal casket ornament attachment mechanism which would permit both the generally three-dimensional figurine type casket shell corner ornaments as well as the generally two-dimensional medallion type casket lid cap panel ornaments to be readily secured to either the casket shell corner or to the casket cap magnetic cap panel. This would permit a funeral director to be able to quickly and easily attach either type of ornament to either casket location without having to change out the fastener hardware, keep on hand and keep track of loose magnets, lose screws, adapter plates, and the like. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, a casket comprises a casket shell including at least one keyhole groove in an exterior surface thereof, a casket lid closeable on the shell, the lid including a magnetic cap panel mounted therein, a universal ornament base having a front side and a rear side, the rear side including at least one magnet mounted thereon and at least one fastener secured thereto, the fastener having a head thereon, and an ornament insert secured to the front side of the ornament base. The ornament base and ornament insert can be removably secured to the shell by inserting the head of the fastener in the keyhole groove of the shell and seating the head of the fastener in the keyhole groove, or to the lid by positioning the magnet on the magnetic cap panel, as desired. The ornament insert can be either a generally three-dimensional figurine type ornament or a generally two-dimensional medallion type ornament. The ornament base can be fabricated of plastic, for example. The magnet can be positioned on an axis of symmetry of the ornament base and the fastener can be positioned offset from the axis of symmetry of the ornament base. The at least one magnet preferably comprises a single magnet positioned near a perimeter of the ornament base and on an axis of symmetry of the ornament base, and the at least one fastener preferably comprises a pair of vertically spaced fasteners positioned well within the perimeter of the ornament base and offset from the axis of symmetry of the ornament base.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to FIG. 1, a casket 10 has a shell 12 adapted to receive the remains of a deceased having a pair of side walls 14, 14, a pair of end walls 16, 16, and a bottom wall 18, and a cap 20 closable on the shell 12. The casket may have a pair of caps or a single cap the full length of the casket. Cap 20 has an ornamental dish assembly 22 mounted to an underside of the cap 20. The dish assembly 22 includes a cap panel 24 and may include ornamental puffing members 26 mounted around a periphery of the dish assembly 22. One or more ornaments, for example medallions 30, are mounted to the cap panel 24 of the dish assembly 22. The medallion 30 has text and/or graphics representing a life aspect of the deceased, for example, Father, Brother, Husband, Lawyer, Christian, Hunter, Fisherman, etc. Referring to FIG. 2, the dish assembly 22 is constructed in such a way as to permit medallions 30 to be placed anywhere on the cap panel 24. More particularly, each medallion 30 has a magnet 32 secured on a rear side thereof, for example permanently secured on the rear side thereof or in recesses on/in the rear side thereof with screws, adhesives or the like. Acceptable magnets 32 are neodymium magnets, for example the model ND007509N available from Master Magnetics, Inc., Castle Rock, Colo., www.magnetsource.com. The cap panel 24 is fabricated from a sheet of cardboard or chipboard 34 over which is placed a sheet of magnetic material 36, for example steel. The sheet of magnetic material 36 is then covered with a sheet of decorative material 38. Since the entire surface area of the cap panel 24 is magnetic material, medallions 30 can be placed anywhere within the surface area of the cap panel 24. This permits more freedom in placing and arranging medallions as desired by the funeral director and family, friends, and loved ones of the deceased. Each medallion 30 further includes at least one, and preferably two, shoulder screws 35 attached to a rear face of the medallion 30 for purposes described below. Referring to FIGS. 3A and 3B, casket shell 12 includes a corner back plate 40 mounted with screws (not shown) generally at a 45 degree angle relative to adjacent ones of the side walls 14 and end walls 16 of the shell 12. A mounting plate 42 is mounted with screws (not shown) in a recess 44 in the back plate 40. Mounting plate 42 can be, but need not be, of two-piece construction, with a back portion (not shown) including a pair of vertically spaced spring clips (not shown), and a front portion including at least one, and preferably a pair of, vertically spaced, and preferably but not necessarily L-shaped, keyhole slots 46 which accept the heads of the shoulder screws 35 on medallion 30. Additional details of such a casket corner ornament attachment mechanism may be seen with reference to the assignee's U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,591,466, 6,928,706, and 7,340,810, and US Patent Application Publications Nos. 2010/0077579 and 2012/0266423, all hereby incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth in their entirety. Back plate 40 can be provided with a relieved area 48 to accommodate magnet 32 during installation of medallion 30 on corner back plate 40. Referring now to FIGS. 4-6 and 9, it will be seen that medallion type ornament 30 includes a universal ornament or medallion base 50 and an ornament or medallion insert 52 secured to the universal medallion base 50. Like the medallion of US Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0299895, universal medallion base 50 can be fabricated of metallic material, for example die cast pewter or aluminum, or non-metallic material, for example plastic, with a diameter of about 4.25 inches. Preferably, universal medallion base 50 is injection molded of plastic. Universal medallion base 50 has a recess 54 on a front side thereof for receiving the medallion insert 52. Preferably, the universal medallion base 50 and the recess 54 therein are circular, as is the medallion insert 52. The universal medallion base 50 can further include a one or more decorative circumferential grooves 56 positioned radially between a periphery of the recess 54 and a periphery of the universal medallion base 50. The universal medallion base 50 preferably has three threaded inserts 60, 62, and 64 molded therein. Threaded insert 60 is positioned so as to position magnet 32 on an axis of symmetry A-A of universal medallion base 50 and near a perimeter of universal medallion base 50. Threaded inserts 62, 64 are horizontally offset from the axis of symmetry A-A of universal medallion base 50, are vertically aligned, and are positioned well within the perimeter of the universal ornament base 50. The horizontal offset corresponds to and is to compensate for the horizontal offset of the vertical terminal portions of keyhole slots 46, 46 in the corner back plate 40. A screw 70 passes through bore 72 in magnet 32 and threads into threaded insert 60 to secure magnet 32 onto the rear face of universal medallion base 50. Shoulder screws 74, 76, each having a shoulder 80 and a head 82, are threaded into threaded inserts 62, 64, respectively. A pair of felt or the like pads 86, 86 can be secured onto the rear face of the universal medallion base 50 to stabilize medallion base 50 when placed on magnetic cap panel 24 (FIG. 9) to prevent wobbling. When placing medallion base 50 on magnetic cap panel 24, medallion base 50 is oriented so as to position magnet 32 in the “12 o'clock” position to prevent swinging of the medallion base 50 on magnetic cap panel 24. Medallion insert 52 is received into recess 54 of universal medallion blank 50 and is secured there with adhesives, double-sided adhesive tape, etc 57. Medallion insert 52 is preferably fabricated of brass or bronze and has text and/or graphics in the form of a three-dimensional image 90 die-struck into the medallion insert 52. The medallion insert 52 can have a diameter of about 3.75 inches and a thickness of about 0.030 inches, and the three-dimensional image 90 of the medallion insert 52 can have a height of about 0.065 inches. When installing medallion insert 52 into medallion base 50, care should be taken so as to orient the three-dimensional image 90 so that it is upright and aligned with the axis of symmetry A-A of medallion base 50. In use, a funeral home will receive one or more shipments of caskets 10, universal ornament bases 50 and ornament inserts 52. During funeral planning, the family member/loved one will be offered a number of different ornament inserts 52 from which to choose. Once the family member/loved one has made their selection, the funeral director will ask the family member/loved one whether the ornament is to be mounted to the casket shell or to the casket lid. The funeral director will then secure the selected ornament insert 52 to the universal ornament base 50, and, depending on the answer received from the family member/love one, removably secure the ornament base 50 with ornament insert 52 secured thereto either to the casket shell 12 by inserting the heads 82 of shoulder screws 74, 76 into respective ones of the keyhole grooves 42, 42 in casket shell corner back plate 40 and seating the heads 82 in the grooves 42, 42, or to the casket lid 14 by positioning magnet 32 on the magnetic cap panel 24. Ideally, a funeral home will receive caskets each of which has both the keyhole groove casket shell feature and the magnetic cap panel feature. However, it is possible for the funeral home to receive one group of caskets having just the keyhole groove casket shell feature, and another group of caskets having just the magnetic cap panel feature. In that case, the answer from the family member/loved one as to the location of mounting the ornament will dictate from which group of caskets the family member/loved will make their casket selection. The invention is also applicable to this scenario and consequently this scenario also falls within the scope of the invention. Ideally, universal medallion bases 50 will be shipped to the funeral home with magnets 32 and shoulder screws 74, 76 preinstalled thereto. However, it is possible that the universal medallion bases 50 and hardware 32, 70, 74, 76 therefore could be shipped separately requiring assembly by the funeral director. In that case, once the family member/loved one has instructed the funeral director to mount the ornament to the casket shell or the casket lid, the funeral director need only install either both shoulder screws 74, 76 if the ornament is to be mounted to the casket shell, or the magnet 32 with screw 70 if the ornament is to be mounted to the casket lid. The invention is also applicable to this scenario and consequently this scenario also falls within the scope of the invention. Alternatively still, the universal medallion bases 50 could be shipped to the funeral home with either just both shoulder screws 74, 76 installed, or with just the magnet 32 installed. In the former case, should the family member/loved one opt for casket shell mounting no manipulation of hardware is required. Also in the former case, should the family member/loved one opt for casket lid mounting the magnet 32 is installed; the shoulder screws 74, 76 can be removed or left installed. In the latter case, should the family member/loved one opt for casket shell mounting the shoulder screws 74, 76 are installed; the magnet 32 can be removed or left installed. In the latter case, should the family member/loved one opt for casket lid mounting no manipulation of hardware is required. The invention is also applicable to this scenario and consequently this scenario also falls within the scope of the invention. The invention herein is usable with button medallion inserts to produce a button medallion of the type disclosed in the assignee's US Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0074299, hereby incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth in its entirety. See FIG. 7 wherein button medallion insert 90 is illustrated in use with universal medallion base 50. The invention herein is also usable with domed medallion inserts to produce a domed medallion of the type disclosed in the assignee's U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/675,628 filed Jul. 25, 2012, hereby incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth in its entirety. See FIG. 8 wherein domed medallion insert 92, having a substrate 94 with two-dimensional image thereon and a transparent domed overlayer 96, is illustrated in use with universal medallion base 50. The invention herein is further usable with medallion inserts of other designs/constructions. For example, a porcelain medallion insert could be used with the universal medallion base 50 to produce a porcelain medallion. The invention herein is therefore usable with a myriad of generally two-dimensional medallion style ornament inserts to produce a myriad of generally two-dimensional medallion style ornaments capable of being mounted to either the casket shell corner or the casket cap panel. The invention herein is still further usable with a myriad of generally three-dimensional figurine style ornament inserts to produce a myriad of generally three-dimensional figurine style ornaments capable of being mounted to either the casket shell corner or the casket cap panel. See FIG. 10 wherein a generally three-dimensional figurine style ornament 98 is illustrated in use with universal ornament base 50. Generally three-dimensional figurine style ornament 98 is the subject of the assignee's U.S. Pat. No. Des. 418,961, hereby incorporated by reference herein as if fully set forth in its entirety. Note that rather than being circular to matingly fit into circular recess 54 in universal ornament base 50 like the prior embodiments of medallion inserts described above, figurine style ornament 98 is irregularly shaped and extends beyond the periphery of the recess 54 in universal ornament base 50. In order to mount figurine style ornament 98 to universal ornament base 50, figurine style ornament 98 can be molded with one or more raised surfaces or “stand offs” 100 extending rearwardly from a rear face thereof of a height approximately equal to the depth of the recess 54, and that fit within the perimeter of the circular recess 54, thereby providing a surface to adhere with the adhesive 57 to recess 54. The various embodiments of the invention shown and described are merely for illustrative purposes only, as the drawings and the description are not intended to restrict or limit in any way the scope of the claims. Those skilled in the art will appreciate various changes, modifications, and improvements which can be made to the invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof. The invention in its broader aspects is therefore not limited to the specific details and representative apparatus and methods shown and described. Departures may therefore be made from such details without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept.
