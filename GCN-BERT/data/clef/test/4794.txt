CA 02507208 2005-05-13 L DEVICE FOR FOAMING OF A LIOUID FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a device for foaming of a liquid, in particular milk, having a steam feed, above which is arranged a turbine arranged in a housing, and having an air feed, wherein the turbine is coupled to a beater via a shaft in order to stir the liquid. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Known from WO 90110411 is a device for foaming and simultaneously heating a liquid such as milk, wherein a turbine wheel is driven by superheated steam, which turbine wheel, inside an emulsifying cage, draws in and swirls the liquid to be foamed. Disadvantageous with this device is the fact that the liquid to be foamed comes into direct contact with the turbine wheel and thus impurities can form a deposit, which can be purged only with difficulty. In addition, the design of the turbine wheel acting simultaneously as a beater is disadvantageous, because the turbine is not optimally oriented for the foam formation. Further, known from DE 100 50 719 is a device for producing milk foam, wherein a turbine wheel is provided on a pipe, which wheel drives a beater arranged on the pipe at the end. Further formed on the pipe are air-feed openings and slots for drawing in milk. Through this means the milk enters into a region within the pipe in order to then be conveyed to the beater and there foamed. Impurities can thereby arise inside the pipe, which impurities are difficult to purge. Thus, there is a desire for a device for foaming a liquid, through which device an effective foaming is made possible in a simple structure and which is easy to clean. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the embodiment of the invention, a steam/air mixture is introduced via a pipe into the region of the beater and swirled with the liquid. Through this means, the beater can be optimally suited to the requirements for foam formation, in particular a sufficient stirring of the liquid can be ensured. In addition, the device CA 02507208 2005-05-13 P can be operated hygienically, since only the steam/air mixture is fed within the pipe and, for the most part, the liquid to be foamed does not form deposits in this region, and at least the regions coming into contact with the liquid to be foamed are easily accessible for cleaning. According to a preferred embodiment form of the invention, provided nearby around the beater is a ring-shaped cover, on which several flow-through openings are formed. This cover can, on the one hand, ensure a calming of the flow swirled by the beater and, on the other hand protect the beater from damage when the latter is immersed into a vessel. Preferably, the cover includes several bars, which form flow surfaces that are inclined with respect to a radial direction of the rotation ax√¨s of the beater. Through this means, the flow can be especially well calmed, and the providing of bars has the additional advantage that these are easy to clean and have an open structure. Preferably, the beater with a shaft can be detached from a part of the housing of the turbine for cleaning purposes. In this, the components can be further disassembled among themselves, in order to carry out a thorough cleaning at certain intervals. The detachability of the beater has the advantage that, for the most part, the latter is immersed into a vessel while oriented downward. Through the pulling off of the beater, it can then be cleaned with a brush together with the cover, being easily accessible from below. For a simple operation of the device, the unit consisting of housing, turbine, beater, and pipe is height-adjustable. Here, other components not explicitly named can also be movable with this unit, for example a connection of a steam feed, valves, seals, etc. Preferably, this unit is supported on a mount in a swingable manner, so that the beater can be immersed into a vessel for use and is subsequently removed in an upward fashion and swingable to the side, in order to remove the vessel. If the air feed, viewed in the flow direction, is arranged before the turbine, then more energy is available for the air conveyance, the influence on the efficiency of the turbine being small. Further, the air feed can be arranged in a region of the housing that is protected and thus not vulnerable to impurities. According to a further embodiment of the invention, the air amount that can be admixed is adjustable. For through the amount of air the type of foam can be CA 02507208 2005-05-13 varied; for example, through a lower air feed a finer foam is produced, which in return is longer lasting. The air can in this case be drawn in by means of a venturi effect.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A coffee machine 1 possesses a box-shaped structure and contains a grinding and brewing device, known in itself, for producing coffee. Arranged on the coffee machine 1 at the side is a device 2 for foaming a liquid, in particular milk. The device 2 includes a housing 3, on the underside of which a pipe 4 is provided, on which is formed an expanding, bell-shaped cover 5. Via a bracket, the housing 3 is supported on a rod 6 of the coffee machine 1 in a height-adjustable and swingable manner. As can be seen in Fig. 2, located at the lower region of the housing 3 is a housing ring 7, which is detachably attached to the housing 3 by means of a bayonet connection. Formed on the housing 3 is an extension arm 8, which at its end has a sleeve 9 that is guided on the rod 6. The sleeve 9 can here be Lockable into different rotational positions on the rod 6, so that the device 3 remains in the CA 02507208 2005-05-13 desired swing position. The sleeve 9 can be fixed in height on the rod 6 in a clamping manner. Further provided on the housing 3 is a steam feed l0 in the form of a hose, which is height-adjustable together with the housing 3. Represented in enlarged fashion is Fig. 3 is the region of the steam feed 10 at the transition to the housing 3. Attached to the steam feed 10 is a nozzle 14, the cross section of which is tapered and .thus produces an acceleration of the steam flowing through. Arranged in the region of the following channel with tapered cross section is an air nozzle 19 connected to the environment, by means of which nozzle the air is drawn in. The amount of air can be adjusted via a rotary knob 11, so that a predetermined steam/air mixture enters the housing 3. Arranged in a rotatable manner in the housing 3, more precisely the housing ring 7, is a turbine 12, which displays radially projecting blades 13. From the turbine 12, the steam/air mixture then flows downward through the pipe 4. As shown in Fig. 4, the housing ring 7 can be detached from the housing 3, a downward-projecting connecting piece 15 being formed on the housing 3, which connecting piece can be locked to the housing ring 7 in the manner of a bayonet connection. The unit comprising the housing ring 7, the pipe 4, the cover 5, as a component made of plastic, as well as the parts arranged therein, can be easily cleaned. Shown in Fig. 5 from below is the cover 5 with a beater 20. The beater 20 is ringshaped and displays blades 21 projecting radially from a central rotary axis. Further formed on the ring 22 are outward-projecting projections 23, which produce a swirling of the liquid. The cover 5 arranged around the beater 20 possesses a greater longitudinal extension and shields the beater 20 from contact with other components. The cover possesses a closed part facing the pipe 4 and downward-projecting bars 16, CA 02507208 2005-05-13 between ,which open flow-through openings 18 are formed. The bars 16 are designed so as to be inclined with respect to a radial direction of the rotary axis of the beater 20 and thus have flow guiding surfaces 17 for decelerating the flow. As shown in Figs. 6A and 6B, the device can be further disassembled, in particular a shaft 25 having a head 26 can be decoupled from the turbine 12 and withdrawn from the pipe 4 in order to be cleaned. Fixed to the shaft 25 is an elastic support ring 27, which is accommodated in the pipe 4 in an essentially form-fitted manner for the radial support of the shaft 25. A ring-shaped projection can be provided in the pipe 4 for the axial fixing of the support ring 27. The shaft 25 is provided at the lO lower end with a connecting part 28 on which the beater 20 is mounted. If required, also these components can be connected to each other via detachable clamp and/or plug connections. For the operation of the device, the cover 5 is immersed into a liquid, particularly milk, and the beater 20 is driven by the steam feed 10. In this process, the amount of air fed is set via a rotaw knob 11 and the steam/air mixture enters the liquid in the region of the beater 20 and swirls the liquid. The cover 5 here protects the environment from spray. After use of the device, it is moved upward and swung away to the side in order to remove the container. In place of the shown geometry of the beater 20, other beater geometries and dimensions can also be used for swirling the liquid. Likewise, the shape of the cover as a sleeve with downward-reaching bars as well as the number of bars can be varied. CA 02507208 2012-03-08 1.
