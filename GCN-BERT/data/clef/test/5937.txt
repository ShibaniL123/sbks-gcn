BACKGROUND Description The present invention generally relates to bicyclic compounds useful as S1P1 agonists. Provided herein are bicyclic compounds, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of their use. The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound according to the invention that are useful for the treatment of conditions related to S1P1 modulation, such as autoimmune diseases and vascular disease. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP) is a zwitterionic lysophospholipid metabolite of sphingosine (Sph), which in turn is derived from enzymatic cleavage of ceramides. Enzymatic phosphorylation of Sph by two kinases (SphK1 and SphK2) leads to the production of S1P largely from erythrocytes, but also from a radiation resistant source, possibly the lymphatic endothelium (Pappu, R. et al., Science, 316:295-298 (2007)). Originally thought to operate solely as an intracellular signaling molecule, S1P was subsequently identified as a high affinity ligand for five members of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) class of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) named S1P1 or S1P1, S1P2 or S1P2, S1P3 or S1P3, S1P4 or S1P4, and S1P5 or S1P5 (formerly called EDG-1, EDG-5, EDG-3, EDG-6, and EDG-8, respectively) (Chun, J. et al., Pharmacological Rev., 62:579-587 (2010)). The interaction of S1P with the SIP receptors plays a fundamental physiological role in a large number of processes including cell proliferation, cell morphology, tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, cytoskeletal rearrangement, vascular development, and lymphocyte trafficking (Olivera, A. et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol., 716:123-142 (2011)). S1P receptors are therefore good targets for a wide variety of therapeutic applications such as tumor growth inhibition, vascular disease, and autoimmune diseases. Among the five S1P receptors, S1P1 has a widespread distribution. It is the predominant family member expressed on lymphocytes and plays an important role in lymphocyte trafficking S1P interaction with its receptor S1P1 is required for the egress of immune cells from the lymphoid organs (such as thymus and lymph nodes) into the lymphatic vessels. Downregulation of the S1P1 receptor (which can be accomplished through treatment with agonists of S1P1 via receptor internalization) disrupts lymphocyte migration and homing to various tissues. This results in sequestration of the lymphocytes in lymph organs thereby decreasing the number of circulating lymphocytes that are capable of migration to the affected tissues. The development of an S1P1 receptor modulating agent that suppresses lymphocyte migration to the target sites associated with autoimmune and aberrant inflammatory processes could be efficacious in a number of autoimmune and inflammatory disease states. The following applications have described compounds as S1P1 agonists: WO 03/061567 (U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0070506), WO 03/062248 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,351,725), WO 03/062252 (U.S. Pat.

No. 6,069,143. Also see Hale et al., J. Med. Chem., 47:6662 (2004). There still remains a need for compounds useful as S1P1 agonists and yet having selectivity over S1P3.

It is understood that any and all embodiments of the present invention may be taken in conjunction with any other embodiment or embodiments to describe additional embodiments. It is also to be understood that each individual element of the embodiments is meant to be combined with any and all other elements from any embodiment to describe an additional embodiment. DEFINITIONS The features and advantages of the invention may be more readily understood by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description. It is to be appreciated that certain features of the invention that are, for clarity reasons, described above and below in the context of separate embodiments, may also be combined to form a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention that are, for brevity reasons, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be combined so as to form sub-combinations thereof. Embodiments identified herein as exemplary or preferred are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. Unless specifically stated otherwise herein, references made in the singular may also include the plural. For example, “a” and “an” may refer to either one, or one or more. As used herein, the phase “compounds and/or salts thereof” refers to at least one compound, at least one salt of the compounds, or a combination thereof. For example, compounds of Formula (I) and/or salts thereof includes a compound of Formula (I); two compounds of Formula (I); a salt of a compound of Formula (I); a compound of Formula (I) and one or more salts of the compound of Formula (I); and two or more salts of a compound of Formula (I). Unless otherwise indicated, any atom with unsatisfied valences is assumed to have hydrogen atoms sufficient to satisfy the valences. Listed below are definitions of various terms used to describe the present invention. These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless they are otherwise limited in specific instances) either individually or as part of a larger group. The definitions set forth herein take precedence over definitions set forth in any patent, patent application, and/or patent application publication incorporated herein by reference. Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof may be chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The compounds of Formula (I) can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Unless otherwise indicated, reference to an inventive compound is understood to include reference to one or more salts thereof. The term “salt(s)” denotes acidic and/or basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids and bases. In addition, the term “salt(s)” may include zwitterions (inner salts), e.g., when a compound of Formula (I) contains both a basic moiety, such as an amine or a pyridine or imidazole ring, and an acidic moiety, such as a carboxylic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, such as, for example, acceptable metal and amine salts in which the cation does not contribute significantly to the toxicity or biological activity of the salt. However, other salts may be useful, e.g., in isolation or purification steps which may be employed during preparation, and thus, are contemplated within the scope of the invention. Salts of the compounds of the formula (I) may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of the Formula (I) with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization. Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates (such as those formed with acetic acid or trihaloacetic acid, for example, trifluoroacetic acid), adipates, alginates, ascorbates, aspartates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, cyclopentanepropionates, digluconates, dodecylsulfates, ethanesulfonates, fumarates, glucoheptanoates, glycerophosphates, hemisulfates, heptanoates, hexanoates, hydrochlorides (formed with hydrochloric acid), hydrobromides (formed with hydrogen bromide), hydroiodides, maleates (formed with maleic acid), 2-hydroxyethanesulfonates, lactates, methanesulfonates (formed with methanesulfonic acid), 2-naphthalenesulfonates, nicotinates, nitrates, oxalates, pectinates, persulfates, 3-phenylpropionates, phosphates, picrates, pivalates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates (such as those formed with sulfuric acid), sulfonates (such as those mentioned herein), tartrates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates such as tosylates, undecanoates, and the like.

Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others. Preferred salts include monohydrochloride, hydrogensulfate, methanesulfonate, phosphate or nitrate salts. The compounds of Formula (I) can be provided as amorphous solids or crystalline solids. Lyophilization can be employed to provide the compounds of Formula (I) as a solid. It should further be understood that solvates (e.g., hydrates) of the Compounds of Formula (I) are also within the scope of the present invention. The term “solvate” means a physical association of a compound of Formula (I) with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, isopropanolates, acetonitrile solvates, and ethyl acetate solvates. Methods of solvation are known in the art. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art and are described in: a) Wermuth, C. G. et al., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Chapter 31, Academic Press (1996);b) Bundgaard, H. ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985);c) Bundgaard, H., Chapter 5, “Design and Application of Prodrugs”, Krogsgaard-Larsen, P. et al., eds., A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, pp. 113-191, Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); andd) Testa, B. et al., Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism, Wiley-VCH (2003). In addition, compounds of Formula (I), subsequent to their preparation, can be isolated and purified to obtain a composition containing an amount by weight equal to or greater than 99% of a compound of Formula (I) (“substantially pure”), which is then used or formulated as described herein. Such “substantially pure” compounds of Formula (I) are also contemplated herein as part of the present invention. “Stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. The present invention is intended to embody stable compounds. “Therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention alone or an amount of the combination of compounds claimed or an amount of a compound of the present invention in combination with other active ingredients effective to act as an agonist to S1P1, or effective to treat or prevent autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease states, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. As used herein, “treating” or “treatment” cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting its development; and/or (c) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state. The compounds of the present invention are intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. Compounds in accordance with Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered by any means suitable for the condition to be treated, which can depend on the need for site-specific treatment or quantity of Formula (I) compound to be delivered. Also embraced within this invention is a class of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula (I) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof; and one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants (collectively referred to herein as “carrier” materials) and, if desired, other active ingredients. The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended.

Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. An emulsion can also contain a sweetening agent, a flavoring agent, a preservative, and/or an antioxidant. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art. The compounds of Formula (I) and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can, for example, also be delivered intravenously, subcutaneously, and/or intramuscularly via any pharmaceutically acceptable and suitable injectable form. Exemplary injectable forms include, but are not limited to, for example, sterile aqueous solutions comprising acceptable vehicles and solvents, such as, for example, water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution; sterile oil-in-water microemulsions; and aqueous or oleaginous suspensions. Formulations for parenteral administration may be in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules using one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration or by using other suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The compounds may be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well and widely known in the pharmaceutical art. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition with suitable carriers including saline, dextrose, or water, or with cyclodextrin (i.e., CAPTISOL®), cosolvent solubilization (i.e., propylene glycol) or micellar solubilization (i.e., Tween 80). The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. A sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion can, for example, be prepared by 1) dissolving at least one compound of Formula (I) in an oily phase, such as, for example, a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin; 2) combining the Formula (I) containing oil phase with a water and glycerol mixture; and 3) processing the combination to form a microemulsion. A sterile aqueous or oleaginous suspension can be prepared in accordance with methods already known in the art. For example, a sterile aqueous solution or suspension can be prepared with a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, such as, for example, 1,3-butane diol; and a sterile oleaginous suspension can be prepared with a sterile non-toxic acceptable solvent or suspending medium, such as, for example, sterile fixed oils, e.g., synthetic mono- or diglycerides; and fatty acids, such as, for example, oleic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) such as d-alpha-tocopherol polyethyleneglycol 1000 succinate, surfactants used in pharmaceutical dosage forms such as Tweens, polyethoxylated castor oil such as CREMOPHOR® surfactant (BASF), or other similar polymeric delivery matrices, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat.

The pharmaceutically active compounds of this invention can be processed in accordance with conventional methods of pharmacy to produce medicinal agents for administration to patients, including humans and other mammals. The pharmaceutical compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or may contain conventional adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffers etc. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. The amounts of compounds that are administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex, the medical condition of the subject, the type of disease, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed. Thus, the dosage regimen may vary widely, but can be determined routinely using standard methods. A daily dose of about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 0.0025 and about 50 mg/kg body weight and most preferably between about 0.005 to 10 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day. Other dosing schedules include one dose per week and one dose per two day cycle. For therapeutic purposes, the active compounds of this invention are ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate to the indicated route of administration. If administered orally, the compounds may be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and then tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets may contain a controlled-release formulation as may be provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention comprise at least one compound of Formula (I) and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optionally an additional agent selected from any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, and vehicle. Alternate compositions of this invention comprise a compound of the Formula (I) described herein, or a prodrug thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. Utility The human immune system has evolved to defend the body from micro-organisms, viruses, and parasites that can cause infection, disease or death. Complex regulatory mechanisms ensure that the various cellular components of the immune system target the foreign substances or organisms, while not causing permanent or significant damage to the individual. While the initiating events are not well understood at this time, in autoimmune disease states the immune system directs its inflammatory response to target organs in the afflicted individual. Different autoimmune diseases are typically characterized by the predominate or initial target organ or tissues affected; such as the joint in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, the thyroid gland in the case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the central nervous system in the case of multiple sclerosis, the pancreas in the case of type I diabetes, and the bowel in the case of inflammatory bowel disease. Thus it has been observed that therapeutic agents which act on the immune system or certain cell types of the immune system (such as B-lymphocytes, and T lymphocytes, T cells) may have utility in more than one autoimmune disease. It is well recognized in the art, including the literature references cited herein, that S1P receptors are good targets for a wide variety of therapeutic applications, including autoimmune diseases. S1P receptors make good drug targets, because individual receptors are both tissue- and response-specific. Tissue specificity of the S1P receptors is important, because development of an agonist or antagonist selective for one receptor localizes the cellular response to tissues containing that receptor, limiting unwanted side effects. Response specificity of the S1P receptors is also important because it allows for development of agonists or antagonists that initiate or suppress certain cellular responses without affecting other processes. Therefore, compounds that act on some S1P receptor family members while having diminished or no activity at other family members are desirable and are expected to provide a therapeutic effect with an improved side effect profile (i.e., reduction or elimination of unwanted side effects). As used herein, the term “agonist” in reference to S1P1 refers to an agent which exerts pharmacological effects such as decreased motility of T cells, decreased trafficking of T cells, or decreased egress of T cells from lymphoid tissues. (Rosen et al., Trends in Immunology, 28:102 (2007)). By virtue of their S1P1 activity as agonists, the compounds of the present invention are immunoregulatory agents useful for treating or preventing autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases. The compounds of the present invention are useful to suppress the immune system in instances where immunosuppression is in order, such as in bone marrow, organ or transplant rejection, autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, biliary cirrhosis, uveitis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, bullous pemphigoid, sarcoidosis, psoriasis, autoimmune myositis, Wegener's granulomatosis, ichthyosis, Graves' ophthalmopathy, and asthma.

Intermediate 1 (1R,3S)-Methyl 1-amino-3-(4-bromophenyl)cyclopentanecarboxylate Intermediate 1A: (S)-3-(4-Bromophenyl)cyclopentanone A solution of 4-bromophenylboronic acid (20 g, 100 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (120 mL) in a 500 ml flask was purged with nitrogen for 5 mins. S-BINAP (0.992 g, 1.593 mmol) and bis(norbornadiene)rhodium (I) tetrafluoroborate (0.559 g, 1.494 mmol) were added sequentially to the solution under a positive pressure of nitrogen. After 2 hours of agitation at room temperature, water (20 mL) was added followed by cyclopent-2-enone (8.06 mL, 100 mmol) and Et3N (13.88 mL, 100 mmol). The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 16 hours. The resulting dark solids were removed by filtration and the filtrate was poured into 250 ml of ethyl acetate. The solution was washed with water twice and the organic layer was concentrated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (split into two batches, each run on a 330 g silica column 0%-25% ethyl acetate in hexane) to afford 12.1 grams of (5)-3-(4-bromophenyl)cyclopentanone. HPLC purity was >98% and Chiral HPLC analysis indicated approximately 90% ee. The material was further purified under the Chiral SFC conditions described below. Experimental Details: Instrument: Berger SFC MGIII; Preparative Conditions: Column: CHIRALPAK® AD-H 25×5 cm, 5 μm; Column Temperature: 40° C.; Flow rate: 200 mL/min; Mobile Phase: CO2/MeOH=80/20; Detector Wavelength: 225 nm; Injection Vol.: 1.0 mL; Sample Preparation: 12.1 g in; 210 mL MeOH (Conc. 60 mg/ml); Analytical Conditions: Column: CHIRALPAK® AD 25×0.46 cm, 10 μm; Column Temperature: 40° C.; Flow rate: 2.0 min; Mobile Phase: CO2/MeOH=70/30; Detector Wavelength: 220 nm; Injection Vol.: 5 μL. The desired enantiomer (major isomer) was isolated and named as “PK2” based on the elution order. The enantiomeric purity of the isolated isomer was determined to be greater than 99.6% on SFC/UV area % at 220 nm. After evaporation, 10.5 grams of the desired enantiomer were recovered.

Intermediate 1B: (7S)-7-(4-Bromophenyl)-1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]nonane-2,4-dione A total of 9.8 g (S)-3-(4-bromophenyl)cyclopentanone was used, divided into 2 batches each containing 4.9 g. The two batches were processed under identical conditions as described below. To a mixture of (S)-3-(4-bromophenyl)cyclopentanone (I-1A, 4.9 g, 20.49 mmol) and potassium cyanide (1.935 g, 29.7 mmol) in EtOH (40 mL) and water (20 mL) in a glass pressure vessel was added ammonium carbonate (4.92 g, 51.2 mmol). The reaction vessel was sealed and placed in an oil bath heated at 80° C. for 24 hours, resulting in the formation of a white solid. After cooling the reaction vessel in an ice bath, the vessel was opened and 30 ml of water was added resulting in the formation of additional solids. The solids were collected by filtration, washed twice with 5 ml water, and then dried under high vacuum. The two batches were combined to provide 13.9 g of (7S)-7-(4-bromophenyl)-1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]nonane-2,4-dione) which were used for subsequent reactions without further purification. HPLC retention time=0.82 min (Condition G) LC/MS M+Na=331, 2M+H=619. Intermediate 1C: (3S)-1-Amino-3-(4-bromophenyl)cyclopentanecarboxylic acid To (7S)-7-(4-bromophenyl)-1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]nonane-2,4-dione (I-1B, 13.9 g, 45.0 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (40 mL) in a round bottom flask was added aqueous NaOH (2N, 100 mL, 200 mmol). The mixture was heated to 95° C. and stirred for 24 hours. Additional NaOH (25 mL, 50 mmol) was added and heating continued for another two days. The solution was cooled with an ice-bath, neutralized with 5N HCl to approximately pH 7 resulting in the formation of a white precipitate. The solids were collected by filtration and dried under high vacuum for 2 days to provide 14 g of (3S)-1-amino-3-(4-bromophenyl)cyclopentanecarboxylic acid as a white solid which was used as such for the subsequent step without further purification. HPLC retention time=0.64 min (Condition G) LC/MS M+1=284/286. Intermediate 1D: (3S)-Methyl 1-amino-3-(4-bromophenyl)cyclopentanecarboxylate To a heterogeneous mixture of (3S)-1-amino-3-(4-bromophenyl)cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (I-1C, 14 g, 49.3 mmol) in MeOH (250 mL) was added thionyl chloride (36.0 mL, 493 mmol) dropwise over a period of 20 minutes at room temperature via an additional funnel (exothermic). The reaction mixture was placed in an oil bath and heated to 70° C. for 4 hours. The solvent was removed under vacuum, with the residue being dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 mL) and washed twice with 1N NaOH.

The resulting yellow solid was slurried in warm ethyl acetate, with sonication and then filtered. The solid was air-dried and placed under vacuum and the filtrate was evaporated to afford Solid 1: white solid, 4.28 g LCMS shows >98% AP. The filtrate was evaporated to afford a yellow solid (1.89 g). The solid from the filtrate was slurried in a minimal amount of hot ethyl acetate, with sonication, then cooled (ice bath) and filtered cold.

Biological Assays Mouse Whole Blood Phosphorylation (WBP) Assay The compounds of Formula (III) require bioactivation through phosphorylation of the alcohol to provide an active phosphate ester compound of Formula (II). According to Brinkmann, V. et al., (J. Biol. Chem. 277:21453-21457 (2002)), the stereoisomeric configuration of the amine bearing carbon center can influence the relative extent to which this phosphorylation takes place. The relative extent of phospholylation of Examples 1-2 and Compounds 3-8 were evaluated by incubation of the alcohol compounds in whole blood from a mouse. The appearance of the phosphorylated compound was measured after 4 hours to determine the relative extent of phosphate ester formation. Whole blood was freshly obtained from BALB/C mice by retro-orbital bleeding and collected into EDTA containing tubes. The EDTA treated whole blood was aliquoted into 1.4 mL polypropylene tubes in 96 well format (100 μL per sample) and spiked with test compound (1 mM in DMSO) for a final concentration of 10 μM (n=2 per compound). Tubes were sealed and vortexed then transferred to orbital shaker for incubation at 37° C., 225 RPM for 4 hours. At the end of the incubation, samples were spotted onto Ahlstrom 226 untreated Specimen Collection Paper (25 μL per spot n=2) and allowed to air dry overnight. Dried Blood Spot (DBS) Cards were stored at ambient temperature in sealed plastic bags with desiccant added. When ready for analysis, a 6 mm punch (equivalent to 12.5 μl of wet blood) was taken at n=1 and placed in a shallow 96-well filter plate. Next, 105 μL of a mixture of 75% acetonitrile and 25% water containing Internal Standard was added and gently vortexed for 30 min then centrifuged. Supernatant was separated from the protein pellet and 5 μl was injected. The parent (alcohol) and active phosphate ester compounds were quantitatively analyzed, using a DBS calibration curve, by LC/MS/MS on a Triple Quadrapole Instrument. The area ratios of the phosphorylated compound to the parent (alcohol) compound were determined. A larger value for the ratio of the phosphorylated compound to the parent (alcohol) compound indicated greater phosphate ester compound formation from the parent (alcohol) compound. Table 2 shows the results (average of two experiments) for Examples 1-2 and Compounds 3-8 at 4 hours. For Examples 1-2 and Compound 6, the area ratios of the phosphate ester compound formation from the parent (alcohol) compounds at 4 hour were at least 0.59. In contrast, the area ratios of the phosphate ester compound formation from parent (alcohol) compounds for Compounds 3-5 and 7-8 were 0.17 or less. In this study, Examples 1-2 and Compound 6 were found to undergo phosphorylation to a greater extent than Compounds 3-5 and 7-8. TABLE 2 Mouse Whole Blood Phosphorylation - Extent of Phosphorylation Example or Mouse Whole Blood Compound No. Phosphate Area Ratio at 4 hr 1 1.60 2 0.59 3 0.07 4 0.14 5 0.03 6 0.60 7 0.02 8 0.17 In Vivo Phosphate Ester Formation in Mice BALB/c mice were dosed orally with Example 1, Example 2, Compound 3, and Compound 4 (10 mg/kg as a solution or suspension in the vehicle, polyethylene glycol 300, “PEG300”). Blood was drawn at 24 hr, spotted onto Dried Blood Spot (DBS) Cards, and analyzed as described for the WBP assay. Reference material (parent alcohol and phosphate ester) was analyzed to optimize the LC-MS/MS assay and enable data reporting in concentrations. DBS standard curves containing both parent alcohol and phosphate ester compounds were prepared and analyzed in the same manner as the study samples and analyzed by the optimized LC-MS/MS to quantify the amount of phosphate ester compound formed. The results in Table 3 represent the average results of all animals within each treatment group (n=3). A larger value for the phosphate ester compound concentration indicated greater phosphate ester compound formation from parent (alcohol) compound. In this study, Examples 1-2 were found to undergo phosphate ester formation to a greater extent than Compounds 3-4. The results of this in vivo study are consistent with the results obtained in the above Mouse Whole Blood Phosphorylation study.

Cells pellets (1×109 cells/pellet) were suspended in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and disrupted on ice using the Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (48,000 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The membrane pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA and stored in aliquots at −80° C. after protein concentration determination. Membranes (2 μg/well) and 0.03 nM final concentration of 33P-S1P ligand (1 mCi/ml, Perkin Elmer or American Radiolabeled Chemicals) diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% fatty acid free BSA (bovine serum albumin), 1 mM NaF) were added to the compound plates (384 FALCON® v-bottom plate (0.5 μl/well in a 11 point, 3-fold dilution). Binding was performed for 45 minutes at room temperature, terminated by collecting the membranes onto 384-well Millipore FB filter plates, and radioactivity was measured by TOPCOUNT®. The competition data of the test compounds over a range of concentrations was plotted as percentage inhibition of radioligand specific binding. The IC50 is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific binding by 50%. The IC50 for Example 10 was determined to be 0.01 nM. Receptor [35S] GTPγS Binding Assays Compounds were loaded in a 384 FALCON® v-bottom plate (0.5 μl/well in a 11 point, 3-fold dilution). Membranes prepared from S1P1/CHO cells or EDG3-Ga15-bla HEK293T cells (EDG3 equivalent S1P3) were added to the compound plate (40 μl/well, final protein 3 μg/well) with MULTIDROP®. [35S]GTP (1250 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer) was diluted in assay buffer: 20 mM HEPES, pH7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid), 1 mM DTT (Dithiothreitol), 10 μM GDP, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA, and 10 μg/ml Saponin to 0.4 nM. 40 μl of the [35S] GTP solution was added to the compound plate with a final concentration of 0.2 nM. The reaction was kept at room temperature for 45 min. At the end of incubation, all the mixtures in the compound plate were transferred to Millipore 384-well FB filter plates via the VELOCITY11® Vprep liquid handler. The filter plate was washed with water 4 times by using the manifold Embla plate washer and dried at 60° C. for 45 min. MicroScint 20 scintillation fluid (30 μl) was added to each well for counting on the Packard TOPCOUNT®. EC50 is defined as the agonist concentration that corresponds to 50% of the Ymax (maximal response) obtained for each individual compound tested. The EC50 for Example 10 was determined to be 0.9 nM in the assay utilizing membranes prepared from S1P1/CHO cells. The EC50 for Example 10 was determined to be >62,500 nM in the assay utilizing membranes prepared from EDG3-Ga15-bla HEK293T cells. A smaller value for GTPγS S1P1 EC50 value indicated greater activity for the compound in the GTPγS S1P1 binding assay. A larger value for the GTPγS S1P3 EC50 value indicated less activity in the GTPγS S1P3 binding assay. Example 10, which is the active phosphate ester of Example 2, possessed activity as an agonist of S1P1 and is selective over S1P3. Thus the compounds of the present invention, which include Examples 1-2 and 9-10 may be used in treating, preventing, or curing various S1P1 receptor-related conditions while reducing or minimizing the side effects due to S1P3 activity. The surprising selectivity of the compounds of the present invention indicate their potential use in treating, preventing, or curing autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, or psoriasis, while reducing or minimizing possible side effects due to S1P3 activity. Other potential uses of the compounds of the present invention include minimizing or reducing rejection of transplanted organs, while reducing or minimizing side effects due to S1P3 activity. S1P1 Receptor Internalization Assay CHO-K1 cells expressing a GFP-tagged S1P1 receptor were plated in 384-well poly-D-lysine coated tissue culture plates at 4×103 cells/well in 50 μl assay media (F12 with L-glutamine, 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS, 1× penicillin-streptomycin, 1M HEPES). Cell plates were incubated overnight at 37° C./5% CO2. Test compound were introduced to the cell plate from a compound source plate at 11 point, 3 fold serial dilutions and then the assay plates were incubated at 37° C./5% CO2 for 45 min. Cells were fixed and stained with 6% formaldehyde and 15 μg/ml Hoechst dye in PBS (Ca2+/Mg2+ free) at room temperature for 15 minutes. Cell plates were washed 4 times with PBS (Ca2+/Mg2+ free) with addition of 50 μl/PBS prior to plate sealing. Images were acquired by the Cellomics ARRAYSCAN® VTI high content imager. Data analysis for EC50 determination relative to internal control compound was accomplished using the Compartmental Analysis BioApplication on the Array Scan. The EC50 is defined as the agonist concentration that corresponds to 50% of the Ymax (maximal response) obtained for each individual compound tested and was quantified using the 4 parameter logistic equation to fit the data. The EC50 for Example 9 was determined to be 361 nM in the assay Blood Lymphocyte Reduction (BLR) Assay in Rodent Lewis rats were dosed orally with vehicle alone (polyethylene glycol 300, “PEG300”) or with 2-amino-2-[2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl]-1,3-propanediol, hydrochloride (CAS: 162359-56-0) as a solution in the vehicle at doses of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg adjusted to reflect the free amount of test article. The results are provided in Table 4a and the level of lymphocyte reduction at 24 hours post-dose was maximal at 3.0 mg/kg. The percent reduction in lymphocytes is dose-related but the relationship is not linear, with non-proportional increases in dose being required to elicit sequentially greater reductions in lymphocyte counts. For example, in this study to demonstrate a change of 13% (from 69% reduction to 82% reduction) required escalation of five-fold in dose (from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg). Furthermore, to demonstrate an additional change of 7% in this study (from 82% reduction to 89% reduction) required escalation of six-fold in dose (from 0.5 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg). BALB/c mice were dosed orally with vehicle alone (polyethylene glycol 300, “PEG300”) or with Example 1, Example 2, Compound 6, Compound 8, or Comparative Compound 11. Compounds were dosed as a solution or suspension in the vehicle, adjusted to reflect the free amount of test article in the event that salt forms are utilized. Blood was drawn at 24 hr and blood lymphocyte counts were determined on an ADVIA® 120 Hematology Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). The results were measured as a reduction in the percentage of circulating lymphocytes as compared to the vehicle treated group at the time of measurement. The results represent the average results of all animals within each treatment group (n=2-4). The results of the Blood Lymphocyte Reduction assay (BLR) in mouse described hereinabove are shown in Table 4b.

Increased levels of protein in BAL fluid were indicative of undesired pulmonary effects, such as pulmonary edema. Example 1, Example 2, Compound 6, Compound 8, and Compound 11 were administered orally to mice at a dose of 30 mg/kg. At 24 hours post dose, the mice were euthanized with intraperitoneal barbiturate overdose. The animals were placed in a supine position, a skin incision was made and blunt dissection followed to expose the trachea. The trachea was incised and a catheter was inserted 4-6 mm into the trachea. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 1 mL/mouse) was infused into the lungs and then aspirated. The concentration of the BAL protein in the recovered BAL fluid was determined on an ADVIA® 1800 Chemistry Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). The results of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) assay are shown in Table 5. The results represent the average results of all animals within each treatment group (n=2-4).

A value for the relative BAL protein versus control of greater than 1 indicated an increase in pulmonary toxicity compared to the administration of vehicle only. In this study, as reported in Table 5, the administration of Examples 1 and 2 gave relative BAL protein levels of 0.99 and 0.96, indicating no increase in the pulmonary toxicity. The administration of Compound 8 gave a relative BAL protein level of 1.03, which indicated slight or no increase in pulmonary toxicity. In contrast, administration of Compound 6 and Compound 11 gave relative BAL protein levels of 1.94 and 1.33, indicating increased pulmonary toxicity. The compounds of the present invention, as exemplified by Examples 1 and 2, have been compared to a) Compounds 6 and 8, and b) Comparative Compound 11, disclosed in WO 2008/079382, and have been found to be especially advantageous. The compounds of the present invention had the surprising advantage of the combination of activity in reducing blood lymphocytes and minimizing pulmonary side effects, such as pulmonary edema. As shown in Tables 4b and 5, in the reported tests, Examples 1 and 2 of this invention show the surprising advantage in efficacy of reducing blood lymphocytes without increasing in the BAL protein, a measure of pulmonary side effects. For example, as compared to Compounds 6, 8, and 11, the exemplified compounds of the invention reported in Table 4b and 5 reduced the blood lymphocytes by 88% and 90%, and gave relative BAL protein levels of 0.99 and 0.96, respectively, which indicated no increase in pulmonary side effects. In contrast, in similar tests, Compound 6 and Comparative Compound 11 reduced blood lymphocytes by 78% and 52%, and gave relative BAL protein levels of 1.96 and 1.33, respectively, indicating increased risk of pulmonary side effects. Compound 8 reduced blood lymphocytes by 59% and gave relative BAL protein levels of 1.03, which indicated no or slight increase in pulmonary side effects.

The surprising selectivity of the compounds of the present invention indicate their potential use in treating, preventing, or curing autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, lupus, or psoriasis, while reducing or minimizing possible pulmonary side effects. Other potential uses of the compounds of the present invention include minimizing or reducing rejection of transplanted organs, while reducing or minimizing possible pulmonary side effects. Rat Adjuvant Induced Arthritis Assay (AA) The rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model is an animal model for human rheumatoid arthritis. Male Lewis rats (150-175 g; Harlan, n=8 treatment group) were immunized at the base of the tail with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml freshly ground Mycobacterium butyricum (Difco Laboratories) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (sigma). Animals were dosed once daily with the test article (as a solution or suspension in the vehicle) or vehicle alone (polyethylene glycol 300, “PEG300”) starting from the day of immunization. The volumes of their hind paws were measured in a water displacement plethysmometer (Ugo Basile, Italy). The baseline paw measurements were taken before onset of the disease (between day 7 to day 10). The paw measurements were then taken three times a week until the end of the study on day 20 to 21. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee. Example 2 of the present invention was tested in the Rat Adjuvant Induced Arthritis assay described hereinabove and the results are shown in Table 7. The compound of this invention, as exemplified by Example 2, in the reported test, showed inhibition of disease progression as measured by reduced paw swelling in the Lewis rat using a prophylactic oral dosing regimen.

Colitis was induced in CB-17 SCID mice by the adoptive transfer of FACS sorted CD4+CD45RBhigh T cells from BALB/c mice (3×105/mouse, i.p.). Disease activities were monitored once a week for the initial 3 weeks and 3×/week for the subsequent weeks on the basis of body weight, soft stool or diarrhea, and anorectal prolapse. Animals were dosed orally every other day (q.o.d.) with the test article or vehicle starting from the day of T cell transfer. Mice were sacrificed 6 wk after T cell reconstitution and analyzed for bowel inflammation based on histological examination of H&E stained colon tissues. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee. Example 2 was tested in the mouse T cell transfer induced colitis model described hereinabove and the results are shown in Table 8. The compound of this invention, as exemplified by Example 2, in the reported test, showed inhibition of disease progression as measured by reduced body weight loss or increase body weight, and a reduction in inflammation and damage in the mouse T Cell transfer induced colitis assay.

Male MRL/lpr mice (14 weeks old; Jackson Laboratories; n=12-13) were orally dosed with Example 2 (as a solution in vehicle) or vehicle alone (polyethylene glycol 300) twice a week for 11 weeks starting on day 0. Urine protein levels (by Albustix) were measured on day 0 and throughout the study. Table 9 indicates the percentage of mice in each treatment groups that demonstrated high levels of proteinurea (greater than 100 mg/dL) at 25 weeks of age. Additional groups of mice received a daily oral dose of dexamethasone (Dex) either independently or in combination with twice weekly dosing with Example 2. Urine protein levels (by Albustix) were measured on day 0 and throughout the study. Table 9 indicates the percentage of mice in each treatment groups that demonstrated high levels of proteinurea (greater than 100 mg/dL) at 24 weeks of age. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care Use Committee. Example 2 was tested in the MRL/lpr mouse model of spontaneous lupus erythematosus assay described hereinabove and the results are shown in Table 9. The compound of this invention, as exemplified by Example 2, in the reported test, showed inhibition of disease progression as measured by a lower percentage of mice with a proteinurea level of greater than 100 mg/dL.

Single Crystal X-Ray Diffractometry The single crystal data were collected on a Bruker-AXS APEX2 CCD system using Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å). Indexing and processing of the measured intensity data were carried out with the APEX2 software program suite. When indicated, crystals were cooled in the cold stream of an Oxford cryo system during data collection. The structures were solved by the direct methods and refined on the basis of observed reflections using the SHELXTL program. The derived atomic parameters (coordinates and temperature factors) were refined through full matrix least-squares. The function minimized in the refinements was Σw(|Fo|−|Fc|)2. R is defined as Σ∥Fo|−|Fc|/Σ|Fo| while Rw=[Σw(|Fo|−|Fc|)2/Σw|Fo|2]1/2 where w is an appropriate weighting function based on errors in the observed intensities. Typically, all the non-H atoms were refined anisotropically and all H-atoms other than those attached to N and O atoms were calculated by geometrical methods and refined using a riding model. X-Ray Powder Diffractometry X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) data were obtained using a Bruker GADDS (General Area Detector Diffraction System) manual chi platform goniometer. Powder samples were placed in thin walled glass capillaries of 0.7 mm in diameter; the capillaries were rotated during data collection. The sample-to-detector distance was kept at 17 cm. Data were collected with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5418 Δ) in the range 2.5<2θ<35° with a sample exposure time of 600 seconds. 1-12. (canceled) 13.
