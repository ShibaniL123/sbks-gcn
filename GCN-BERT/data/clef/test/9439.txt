N-[4-(2-Chloroacetyl)phenyl]benzamide (0.241 g, 0.882 mmol) and thiourea (0.071 g, 0.926 mmol) suspended in anhydrous ethanol (5 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120° C. for 30 min. The mixture was diluted with tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) and neutralized with 1N aq. NaOH solution and then extracted with ethyl acetate (4×50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give N-(4-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)phenyl)benzamide (0.08 g, 33%) as a brown solid.
