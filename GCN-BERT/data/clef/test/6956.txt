This application is a continuation in part of prior application No. 61/816,319 filed Apr. 26, 2013. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the type of devices that are used in intraosseous infusion and more particularly to devices that protects an intraosseous infusion needle from being disturbed or dislodged. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Emergency medical services have recently obtained a new weapon in providing immediate vascular access to the central circulation. This weapon is a small IO device for an IV that is drilled in the tibia just below the kneecap. The inventor, an emergency medical technician, has helped to place many of these I/O devices within individuals. Although the placement of the I/O device is easy, the devices can be accidentally knocked out easily. To solve this problem the inventor has devised a device that holds the needle in place and protects it when inadvertently bumped or knocked. The new small IO has been created by Vidacare and is called EZ-IO intraosseous infusion system. The small IO is comprised of a hollow needle and a cap (catheter hub) that is designed to take a catheter from an IV or a needle for infusing medicine or liquids. The device is used when the patient has poor peripheral vasculature and for whose whom vascular access can be challenging. It is a quick and easy solution at the scene of an accident or on the battlefield where action must be immediate and the injured individual may not be in an ideal position. The EZ-IO is easy to place however it is also come out easily. To overcome this problem the inventor has developed a device that will hold the EZ-IO in place on the leg. The feature that enables the inventor's device to hold the EZ-IO is a device that constricts around the EZ-IO and a strap that encircle the leg to hold the constricting device and the EZ-IO in place on the leg. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is a device that is designed to hold an intraosseous infusion system in place when the intraosseous infusion system is implanted in an individual's leg. The invention protects the intraosseous infusion system in place from being bumped and displaced by the environment. The device is a strap and an implement that holds the intraosseous infusion system in place when the intraosseous infusion system is placed in an individual's leg. In the preferred embodiment the strap can be tighten around the individual's leg. On each end of the implement an attachment means attaches a strap to the implement. The implement is a constriction device that constricts around the intraosseous infusion device after the intraosseous infusion device is places within the individual's tibia. In the preferred embodiment the constriction device is comprised of two pieces. The first piece is a U shaped piece that has an opening in its center of a sufficient size that the intraosseous infusion device will fit. The U shape piece is of sufficient height to hold the intraosseous infusion device in place within a patient's leg. At the ends of the constriction device are openings to which the strap is attached. Extending downward from the opening in the U shaped piece is a partial cylindrical extension. The partial cylindrical extension envelops the intraosseous infusion device. It fits snugly around the intraosseous infusion device to hold the intraosseous infusion device in place. A slot extends from the opening in the center of the U shaped piece to the edge of the U-shaped piece. The partial cylindrical extension also has an opening in its front that corresponds to the slot in the U-shaped piece. Opposite the slot on the back end of the U-shaped piece are two L shaped overhangs. The second piece has a ridge that extends from its top. The second piece is rectangular and thin. It has a large slit that runs down its center starting near its top. The top portion of the slit is small. The middle portion extends outward and is circular in shape. The diameter of the circular shape is slightly smaller than the diameter of the intraosseous infusion device. The bottom portion of the slit is nearly as large as the circular portion and extends to the bottom of the second piece. The slit produces two arms that extend downward from the top of the second piece. These two arms are slightly flexible. The thickness and the width of the second piece will enable it to fit between and under the two L shaped overhangs. Another embodiment the constriction device is comprised of two pieces. The first piece is a U shaped piece that has an opening in its center of a sufficient size that the intraosseous infusion device will fit through. The U shape piece is of sufficient height that it fits over the intraosseous infusion device. At the ends of the constriction device are openings to which the strap is attached. On one side of the opening in the center of the device is a set of gears that partially encircles the side of the opening. On the other side of the opening in the center of the constriction device is another smaller opening. This smaller opening is designed to take an axle from the second piece, the pivotal piece. At one end of the pivotal piece is a set of gears that are designed to intermesh with the gears on the U shaped piece. On the same end of the pivotal piece as the gears, the pivotal piece has a V-shaped opening. The V-shaped opening is of sufficient size that its edges will make contact with the intraosseous infusion device when placed around the intraosseous infusion device. In the center of the pivotal piece is a cylindrical column that is designed to snap into the smaller opening on the U-shaped piece. This column forms an axle and allows the pivotal piece to pivot. At the end of the pivotal piece opposite the end with the gears is a flap. This flap is designed such that when an individual puts pressure on the flap the pivotal piece will pivot. To use the first embodiment, the intraosseous infusion device is placed in the patient's leg. Then one that takes the constriction device with the strap and places it on the patient's leg. The strap loosely encircles the patient's leg. The constriction device and the strap are pulled up the leg to a position over the intraosseous infusion device. The constriction device is then a lowered over the intraosseous infusion device and the intraosseous infusion device is placed through the opening in the center of the U shaped piece. The strap than is tightened on the patient's leg. The second piece is than place under the L shaped overhangs and pushed forward towards the intraosseous infusion device. The slot between the two arms of the second piece is of sufficient size that when it makes contact with the intraosseous infusion device it flexes outward and the arms begins moving around the intraosseous infusion device. As the second piece is moved forward the middle circular portion of the slot snaps in place around the intraosseous infusion device. The arms of the slot have sufficient flexibility to hold the intraosseous infusion device in place. To use the second embodiment, the intraosseous infusion device is placed in the patient's leg. Then one that takes the constriction device with the strap and places it on the patient's leg. The strap loosely encircles the patient's leg. The constriction device and the strap are pulled up the leg to a position over the intraosseous infusion device. The constriction device is then a lowered over the intraosseous infusion device and the intraosseous infusion device is placed through the opening in the center of the U shaped piece. The strap than is tightened on the patient's leg. Then one puts pressure on the flap on the pivotal piece causing the pivotal piece to pivot and forcing the edges of the V-shaped cutout in the pivotal piece to make contact with the intraosseous infusion device. When the pivotal piece pivots it ratchets the gears on the top of the pivotal piece and the U shaped piece together. The ratcheting of the gears holds the pivotal piece's V-shaped cutout against the sides of the intraosseous infusion device. The friction between the edges of the V-shaped cutout and the intraosseous infusion device is sufficient to hold the intraosseous infusion device securely in place even if the patient's leg is bumped or moved or the intraosseous infusion device is bumped.

The U-shaped configuration is of a sufficient height that it will hold the intraosseous infusion device 14 when placed in the leg of the patient securely on that leg. FIG. 11 shows the constriction device 100 with the intraosseous infusion device 14 place within. FIG. 8 shows the top view of the U shaped piece 154. At the top of the “U” in the center of the U shaped piece 154 is a center opening 152. On one side of opening 152 is another smaller opening 156. On the opposite side of opening 152 is a set of gears 158. This set of gears 158 is semicircular and curves around opening 152. FIGS. 9 and 10 show the pivoting piece 160 of the constricting device 100. On one end of pivoting device 160 is a set of gears 162. This set of gears 162 is designed to interlock with the set of gears 158 of the U-shaped piece 154. When the pivoting piece 160 is placed upon the U shaped piece 154 the 2 sets of gears 158 and 162 mash and one set of gears 158 or 162 forms a ratchet for the other set of gears 158 or 162. On the same end of the pivoting piece 160 but closer to the center of the pivoting piece 160 is a V shaped cutout 164. The V shaped cutouts 164 is of sufficient size that it can fit around the intraosseous infusion device 14. In the center of the pivotal piece 160 protrudes a circular column 166. The circular column 166 has slits 168 down its sides. At the top of circular column 160 is a ridge 170 that protrudes perpendicular and outward from column 166. Ridge 170 has a slanted top. Column 160 with its slanted top ridge 170 is designed to snap into smaller opening 156 in the U-shaped piece 154. Column 166 is designed to form an axle within opening 156. The axle formed by column 166 enables pivotal piece 60 to pivot. At the end of the pivotal piece 160 opposite the end with the gears 62 a flap 174 extends upward from the pivotal piece 160. This flap 174 when pressure is placed upon it will cause the pivotal piece 160 when it is in place on the constriction device 100 to pivot. To the use either of the embodiments of the invention the intraosseous infusion device 14 is placed in the patient's leg. Then one takes the constriction device 10 or 100 with the strap 12 and places it on the patient's leg. The strap 12 loosely in circles the patient's leg. The constricting device 10 or 100 and strap 12 are pulled up the leg to a position over top the intraosseous infusion device 14. The constricting device 10 or 100 is then lowered over the intraosseous infusion device 14 and the intraosseous infusion device 14 is placed through opening 52 or 152. The strap 12 is then tightened upon the patient's leg. In the first embodiment one than puts pressure on the ridge 64 of the second piece 60 pushing it under the L shaped overhangs 56 and 58 and against and around the intraosseous infusion device 14 until the arms 76 and 78 of the second piece 60 snap around the intraosseous infusion device 14 and hold it security within the middle portion 70 of the slit 66. Even if the patient's leg is bumped or moved or the intraosseous infusion device 14 is bumped, the intraosseous infusion device will remain in place. Once one has placed the second embodiment of the constriction device 100 on the leg over the intraosseous infusion device 14, one puts pressure on the flap 174 causing the pivotal piece 160 to pivot and forcing the edges of the V shaped cutout 164 to make contact with the intraosseous infusion device 14. When the pivotal piece 162 pivots it ratchets gears 158 and 162 together. This ratcheting of gears 158 and 162 holds pivotal piece's 160 V-shape cut out 164 against the sides of the intraosseous infusion device 14. The friction between the edges of the V-shaped cutout 164 and the intraosseous infusion device 14 is sufficient to hold the intraosseous infusion device 14 securely in place even if the patient's leg is bumped or moved or the intraosseous infusion device 14 is bumped.
