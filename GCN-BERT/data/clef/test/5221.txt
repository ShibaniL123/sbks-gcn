3-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione
Step 1
3-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione
1-Methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione (50.0 mg, 0.281 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (4 mL). 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl methanesulfonate (78.0 mg, 0.308 mmol), potassium iodide (9.0 mg, 0.056 mmol) and potassium carbonate (76.0 mg, 0.561 mmol) were added at 25°C. The reaction solution was heated to 120°C and stirred for 16 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC to give 3-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione (12.0 mg) with a yield of 13%.
