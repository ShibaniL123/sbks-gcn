Intermediate 43: 8-Bromo-2-cyclopropyl-7-methylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine
To a microwave vial charged with EtOH (3.0 mL) were added 3-bromo-4-methylpyridin-2-amine (100 mg, 0.535 mmol), 2-bromo-1-cyclopropylethan-1-one (115 μL, 1.176 mmol), and potassium phosphate (340 mg, 1.60 mmol). The vial was capped and the heated to 160° C. in the microwave for 60 minutes. After cooling to rt, additional 2-bromo-1-cyclopropylethan-1-one (120 μL, 1.23 mmol) and potassium phosphate (340 mg, 1.60 mmol) were added. The vial was capped and reaction heated to 160° C. in the microwave for an additional 60 minutes. After cooling to rt, the reaction was diluted with H2O and extracted with EtOAc (×3). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-20% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a light orange/yellow solid (36 mg, 27% yield).
