The second step
A mixed solution of Compound 48 (8.24g, 32.9mmol) in acetic acid (60mL) - water (25 mL) was stirred for 5 hours at 60 °C, and then stirred for 6 hours at 80 °C. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution was added thereto, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 49 (3.49g, yield 51%).
