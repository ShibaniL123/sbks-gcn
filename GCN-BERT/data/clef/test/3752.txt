Step 4. 3-(4-Amino-6-bromoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-N-(4-cyanobicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide
A solution of 3-(4-aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-N-(4-cyanobicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-1-yl)benzenesulfonamide (68 mg, 0.17 mmol) and N-bromosuccinimide (37 mg, 0.21 mmol) in DMF (1.5 mL) was heated to 50Â° C. for 2 hours. Upon cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc, washed with water and brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient from 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes to afford product (23 mg, 28%). LCMS for C18H17BrN7O2S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=474.0, found 474.1.
