BACKGROUND An endoscope is a medical-imaging device that may be used to examine the interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body. Endoscopes may be used to provide visualization for non-invasive treatment of conditions within the nasal cavity and nasopharynx (among other places). For instance, an example of such treatment in the nasal cavity is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2011/0004057, entitled “Systems and Methods for Transnasal Dilation of Passageways in the Ear, Nose, or Throat,” issued Feb. 4, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. An endoscope has an elongate body equipped with an imaging device for viewing of the treatment site within the patient. Some endoscopes are limited to a fixed viewing angle, however, a multi-angle endoscope is capable of a much broader range of viewing. A multi-angle endoscope is also capable of multiple viewing angles and rotation about the longitudinal axis of the elongate body. For instance, a multi-angle endoscope is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2010/0030031, entitled “Swing Prism Endoscope,” issued Feb. 4, 2010, the disclosure of which is also incorporated by reference herein. With such a wide capability of viewing, it may be confusing for the operator of a multi-angle endoscope to keep track of the exact viewing angle. Some endoscopes may be equipped with a means of determining the viewing angle; however, the operator may be required to look away from the endoscopic view displayed on a monitor in order to determine the viewing angle of the instrument. An endoscope operator may wish to determine the exact viewing angle without having to look away from the endoscopic view displayed on the monitor. While several medical devices have been made and used, it is believed that no one prior to the inventors has made or used the invention described in the appended claims.

The drawings are not intended to be limiting in any way, and it is contemplated that various embodiments of the technology may be carried out in a variety of other ways, including those not necessarily depicted in the drawings. The accompanying drawings incorporated in and forming a part of the specification illustrate several aspects of the present technology, and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the technology; it being understood, however, that this technology is not limited to the precise arrangements shown. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following description of certain examples of the technology should not be used to limit its scope. Other examples, features, aspects, embodiments, and advantages of the technology will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description, which is by way of illustration, one of the best modes contemplated for carrying out the technology. As will be realized, the technology described herein is capable of other different and obvious aspects, all without departing from the technology. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions should be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive. It is further understood that any one or more of the teachings, expressions, embodiments, examples, etc. described herein may be combined with any one or more of the other teachings, expressions, embodiments, examples, etc. that are described herein. The following-described teachings, expressions, embodiments, examples, etc. should therefore not be viewed in isolation relative to each other. Various suitable ways in which the teachings herein may be combined will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the claims. As shown in FIG. 1, endoscope (10) of the present example comprises a body (22), a shaft (12), a directional control dial (16), an angle control dial (18), a distal portion (14), and an eyepiece (20). At least part of endoscope (10) is configured substantially in accordance with at least some of the teachings of U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2010/0030031, entitled “Swing Prism Endoscope,” published Feb. 4, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Directional control dial (16) is operable to rotate shaft (12) relative to body (22), about the longitudinal axis (LA) defined by the shaft (12). Eyepiece (20) may be compatible with any standard endoscopic camera to communicate the images within the viewing field (200) to an external monitor (not shown). As shown in FIG. 2, the distal portion (14) of shaft (12) in the present example comprises a swing prism (50), a translating actuator (52), and a self-focusing lens (56). The swing prism (50) is pivotally mounted within shaft (12) such that prism (50) pivots about a pivot axis (PA). The pivot axis (PA) extends transversely relative to the longitudinal axis (LA) of shaft (12). Translating actuator (52) is coupled with angle control dial (18) such that actuator (52) translates along a path that is parallel to the longitudinal axis (LA) when angle control dial (18) is rotated about the longitudinal axis (LA). By way of example only, a nut and lead screw assembly (not shown) may be used to convert rotary motion of angle control dial (18) into longitudinal motion of actuator (52). Actuator (52) may comprise any suitable structure, such as a push-pull cable, a rod, a beam, etc. Actuator (52) is operable to drive prism (50) to pivot about pivot axis (PA) when actuator (52) translates longitudinally. Thus, control dial (18) is rotatable to pivot prism (50). In the present example, prism (50) is coupled with a resilient member (58) that is anchored within shaft (12) and that resiliently biases prism (50) to an orientation where the line of sight (LS) is aligned with or at least parallel to longitudinal axis (LA). Of course, resilient member (58) may simply be omitted, if desired. It should also be understood that prism (50) may alternatively be driven in accordance with any of the teachings of U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2010/0030031, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein; and/or in any other suitable fashion. Prism (50) is configured to transmit a view from window (24) to self-focusing lens (56), with the view then being further transmitted through one or more rod lenses (54) located proximal to lens (56) to reach eyepiece (20). This view is based on a line of sight (LS) provided by prism (50), which changes as prism (50) pivots about pivot axis (PA). A viewing angle (α) is defined between the line of sight (LS) provided by prism (50) and the longitudinal axis (LA) of shaft (12). The angle control dial (18) is operable to pan the viewing field (200) throughout a series of viewing angles (α), as shown in FIGS. 2-3. The viewing angles (α) of the present example range from 0° to 120°, through it should be understood that any other suitable range of viewing angles (α) may be provided (e.g., from 10° to 90°). It should also be understood that swing prism (50) rotates with shaft (12) about the longitudinal axis (LA) of shaft (12), such that rotation of directional control dial (16) accomplishes rotation of swing prism (50) and the rest of shaft (12) about the longitudinal axis (LA) of shaft (12). Swing prism (50) is thus independently rotatable about two perpendicular axes (PA, LA). As shown in FIG. 4, window (24) extends along a curved path to accommodate the wide viewing angle (α) range provided by swing prism (50). Window (24) of the present example comprises glass, but it should be understood that any other suitable material may be used (e.g., crystal, plastic, etc.). The rod lens (54) extends coaxially through the center of the shaft (12) to the eyepiece (20) and may transmit the image from window (24) and lens (56) to the eyepiece (20) or an external monitor (not shown). It may be desirable to utilize an indicator feature (100) at the distal portion (14) of the shaft (12) in order to display the viewing angle (α) of the viewing field (200) through the eyepiece (20) and/or on an external monitor (not shown), as shown in FIGS. 4-10. As an example only, such an indicator feature (100) may comprise a series of indicators (110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 140) along the length of indicator feature (100), as shown in FIGS. 4-10. Indicator feature (100) of the present example comprises a curved extrusion at distal portion (14) of shaft (12). Such a curved shape will allow for indicator feature (100) to remain within the viewing field (200) of endoscope (10) as the operator pans viewing field (200) through a range of viewing angles (α). Indicator feature (100) is positioned so that indicator feature (100) appears in the right most portion of viewing field (200), but may alternatively be positioned anywhere else within viewing field (200). Indicator feature (100) is secured to shaft (12) so that as shaft (12) is rotated by the operator about the longitudinal axis (LA) of shaft (12), indicator feature (100) rotates with shaft (12) and remains in viewing field (200) of endoscope (10). As the viewing angle (α) is changed, different indicators (110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 140) may come into viewing field (200) and allow the operator to determine the viewing angle (α) of the viewing field (200) without having to look away from eyepiece (20) or an external monitor (not shown). Indicators (110, 112, 114, 116, 118) may be color coded to quickly alert the operator of viewing angle (α). For instance, the indicator at 10° (110) may be blue, the indicator at 20° (112) may be green, the indicator at 40° (114) may be yellow, the indicator at 50° (110) may be orange, and the indicator at 90° (110) may be red, as shown in FIGS. 5, 6, and 7. The indicators (110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 140) may be etched, lasered, painted, stenciled, or otherwise created on or within the window (24) through any other appropriate method. Alternatively, the indicator feature (100) may be made from metal, plastic, or any other suitable materials that are secured to or near the inner or outer surface of the window (24) in any suitable fashion. As another merely illustrative example, indicators (140) may display the numerical value of the viewing angle (α), as shown in FIGS. 8, 9, and 10. As yet another example only, indicators (not shown) may include a lettering scheme that allows the operator to determine the viewing angle (α). FIG. 11 shows yet another merely exemplary form of indicator (100), formed by a series of adjacent color bars (150, 152, 154, 156). Color bars (150, 152, 154, 156) of the present example include a blue color bar (150), a green color bar (152), a yellow color bar (154), and a red color bar (156). Of course, any other suitable number of color bars, arrangement of color bars, and selection of colors may be used. It should be understood that the use of color bars (150, 152, 154, 156) may facilitate viewing and interpretation of indicator (100) when indicator (100) is out of focus. For instance, due to the depth of field provided by the optics of endoscope (10), lens (56) and the rest of the optics of endoscope (10) may be focused on an anatomical structure of the patient during use of endoscope (10), and indicator (100) may be too far outside the depth of field to be viewed simultaneously with the anatomical structure with much sharpness. An indicator (100) in the form of color bars (150, 152, 154, 156) may nevertheless be sufficiently discernible even when color bars (150, 152, 154, 156) are significantly out of focus, enabling the operator to keep the anatomical structure in focus while simultaneously reading indicator (100). Other suitable forms that indicator (100) may take will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. It should be understood that any one or more of the teachings, expressions, embodiments, examples, etc. described herein may be combined with any one or more of the other teachings, expressions, embodiments, examples, etc. that are described herein. The above-described teachings, expressions, embodiments, examples, etc. should therefore not be viewed in isolation relative to each other. Various suitable ways in which the teachings herein may be combined will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the claims. It should be appreciated that any patent, publication, or other disclosure material, in whole or in part, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein is incorporated herein only to the extent that the incorporated material does not conflict with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth in this disclosure. As such, and to the extent necessary, the disclosure as explicitly set forth herein supersedes any conflicting material incorporated herein by reference. Any material, or portion thereof, that is said to be incorporated by reference herein, but which conflicts with existing definitions, statements, or other disclosure material set forth herein will only be incorporated to the extent that no conflict arises between that incorporated material and the existing disclosure material. Versions described above may be designed to be disposed of after a single use, or they can be designed to be used multiple times.
