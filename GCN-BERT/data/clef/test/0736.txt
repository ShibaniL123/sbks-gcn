ANTIMICROBIAL OBTURATOR FOR USE WITH VASCULAR ACCESS DEVICES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates generally to obturators for peripheral IV catheters or other vascular access devices. In particular, the present invention relates to obturators that are configured to provide antimicrobial protection to vascular access devices when the obturators are inserted within the vascular access devices. [0002] Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters are used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition into a patient, withdrawing blood from a patient, as well as monitoring various parameters of the patient's vascular system. [0003] Catheter-related bloodstream infections are caused by the colonization of microorganisms in patients with intravascular catheters and I.V. access devices. These infections are an important cause of illness and excess medical costs. More importantly, these infections often result in patient deaths. [0004] Many techniques have been employed to reduce the risk of infection from a catheter or other intravenous device. For example, catheters have been designed that employ an antimicrobial lubricant or an antimicrobial coating on an inner or outer surface of the catheter. Similarly, antimicrobial lubricants or coatings have been applied to the surfaces of other components of a catheter assembly, components attached to the catheter assembly, or other medical devices which may come in direct contact with the patient's vasculature or in contact with a fluid that may enter the patient's vasculature. Further, some devices or components are made of a material that is impregnated with an antimicrobial agent. [0005] Although these techniques have been beneficial, there are various drawbacks that limit their usefulness. For example, it can be difficult and/or expensive to apply an antimicrobial coating or lubricant to the complex internal and external geometries of many devices or components. Also, some devices or components are preferably made of a material that is not suitable for the application of an antimicrobial coating or that cannot be impregnated with an antimicrobial agent. Because of such difficulties, the current techniques for providing antimicrobial protection are oftentimes not used or, if used, are not adequately applied to provide maximum antimicrobial protection. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The present invention extends to obturators for vascular access devices. An obturator configured in accordance with the present invention can include antimicrobial features which assist in sterilizing or maintaining the sterility of fluid contained within a vascular access device while the device is not being used for infusion or other access to the patient's vasculature. [0007] These antimicrobial features include antimicrobial coatings applied to various surfaces of an obturator and antimicrobial components bonded or otherwise secured to an obturator. Various combinations of antimicrobial coatings and/or components can be used on an obturator as necessary to provide a desired amount of antimicrobial agents within a particular enclosed volume of a vascular access device. [0008] In one embodiment, the present invention is implemented as an obturator for a vascular access device. The obturator includes a catheter portion configured to be inserted through a lumen of the vascular access device and into a proximal end of a catheter of the vascular access device while the catheter is placed intravenously within a patient, and a cap portion configured to secure the obturator to the vascular access device. The catheter portion includes an antimicrobial coating configured to release an antimicrobial agent into fluid contained within the vascular access device. [0009] In another embodiment, the present invention is implemented as an obturator for a vascular access device. The obturator includes a catheter portion configured to be inserted through a lumen of the vascular access device and into a proximal end of a catheter of the vascular access device while the catheter is placed intravenously within a patient, a middle portion configured to be positioned within the lumen of the vascular access device while the catheter portion is inserted into the catheter, and a cap portion configured to secure the obturator to the vascular access device. The obturator further includes an antimicrobial ring positioned around the middle portion. The antimicrobial ring is configured to release an antimicrobial agent into fluid contained within the lumen of the vascular access device. [0010] In another embodiment, the present invention is implemented as an obturator for a vascular access device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0018] The present invention extends to obturators for vascular access devices. An obturator configured in accordance with the present invention can include antimicrobial features which assist in sterilizing or maintaining the sterility of fluid contained within a vascular access device while the device is not being used for infusion or other access to the patient's vasculature. [0019] These antimicrobial features include antimicrobial coatings applied to various surfaces of an obturator and antimicrobial components bonded or otherwise secured to an obturator. Various combinations of antimicrobial coatings and/or components can be used on an obturator as necessary to provide a desired amount of antimicrobial agents within a particular enclosed volume of a vascular access device. [0020] In one embodiment, the present invention is implemented as an obturator for a vascular access device. The obturator includes a catheter portion configured to be inserted through a lumen of the vascular access device and into a proximal end of a catheter of the vascular access device while the catheter is placed intravenously within a patient, and a cap portion configured to secure the obturator to the vascular access device. The catheter portion includes an antimicrobial coating configured to release an antimicrobial agent into fluid contained within the vascular access device. [0021] In another embodiment, the present invention is implemented as an obturator for a vascular access device. The obturator includes a catheter portion configured to be inserted through a lumen of the vascular access device and into a proximal end of a catheter of the vascular access device while the catheter is placed intravenously within a patient, a middle portion configured to be positioned within the lumen of the vascular access device while the catheter portion is inserted into the catheter, and a cap portion configured to secure the obturator to the vascular access device. The obturator further includes an antimicrobial ring positioned around the middle portion. The antimicrobial ring is configured to release an antimicrobial agent into fluid contained within the lumen of the vascular access device. [0022] In another embodiment, the present invention is implemented as an obturator for a vascular access device. The obturator includes a catheter portion configured to be inserted through a lumen of the vascular access device and into a proximal end of a catheter of the vascular access device while the catheter is placed intravenously within a patient, and a base portion configured to be inserted into the lumen to seal the lumen. The obturator further includes an antimicrobial component that is configured to release an antimicrobial agent into fluid contained within the lumen of the vascular access device. [0023] An obturator for a vascular access device is commonly used as a means of sealing the lumen of a catheter of a vascular access device while the catheter is positioned intravenously but is not being used for infusion, medication administration, or other types of vascular access. As an example, an obturator may be inserted within a peripheral intravenous catheter when the peripheral intravenous catheter will not be used to access the patient's vasculature for a substantial amount of time (e.g. 24 hours). [0024] Figures 1A-1C illustrate an example embodiment of an obturator configured in accordance with the present invention. Figure 1A illustrates a perspective view of an obturator 100 that is configured to be inserted within a peripheral intravenous catheter or another vascular access device, Figure IB illustrates a cross-sectional view of obturator 100, and Figure 1C illustrates a cross-sectional view of obturator 100 when inserted into a peripheral intravenous catheter 150. [0025] Obturator 100 includes a catheter portion 101, a middle portion 102, a base portion 103, and a cap portion 104. Catheter portion 101 is sized so that is can be inserted within the catheter of a peripheral intravenous catheter. In many cases, the outer diameter of catheter portion 101 is configured to be substantially the same as the inner diameter of the catheter of a peripheral intravenous catheter in which obturator 100 is to be used so that catheter portion 101 forms a seal preventing the flow of fluids through the catheter. Accordingly, catheter portion 101 can be defined as the portion of the obturator that is configured to be inserted into a catheter of a vascular access device. [0026] Catheter portion 101 can be configured with various lengths. For example, the length of catheter portion 101 can be configured so that the distal end of catheter portion 101 is positioned at or near the distal end of the catheter. Alternatively, the length of catheter portion 101 can be configured so that the distal end of catheter portion 101 extends distally out from the catheter. Similarly, the length of catheter portion 101 can be configured so that the distal end of the catheter portion is positioned proximally to the distal end of the catheter. In short, the specific length of catheter portion 101 is not essential to the invention and any length of catheter portion 101 can be employed as long as catheter portion 101 extends at least partially into the catheter when obturator 100 is inserted into the vascular access device. [0027] Middle portion 102 comprises a length of obturator 100 that is positioned between catheter portion 101 and base portion 103. In Figures 1A-1C, middle portion 102 is shown as having a larger diameter than catheter portion 101. However, middle portion 102 could also be configured with a diameter that is the same as or less than the diameter of catheter portion 101. Middle portion 102 is positioned between catheter portion 101 and base portion 103 so that it remains within the lumen of the vascular access device in which obturator 100 is placed. Accordingly, middle portion 102 refers more particularly to a length of the obturator rather than to a separate or distinguishable portion of the obturator. Therefore, even though the figures identify middle portion 102 as a length of the obturator having a different diameter than the other portions, this is not required. [0028] Base portion 103 comprises a portion of obturator 100 having a diameter that is substantially the same as the diameter of the lumen of the vascular access device in which the obturator is used. Therefore, a purpose of base portion 103 is to seal the lumen of a vascular access device. Although the figures illustrate obturators that include base portions configured to seal the lumen of a vascular access device, an obturator in accordance with the present invention does not require a base portion configured in this manner. For example, an obturator can include a base portion that has a diameter that is less than the diameter of the lumen such that the base portion does not seal the lumen. [0029] Cap portion 104 comprises a proximal portion of obturator 100 that is configured to secure the obturator to the vascular access device. In some embodiments such as is shown in the figures, cap portion 104 can be configured to extend overtop the proximal end of the vascular access device. In such embodiments, an inner surface of cap portion 104 can include threads for locking the cap portion 104 to the vascular access device. Alternatively, an inner surface of cap portion 104 can be configured to form a friction fit with the outer surface of the vascular access device. In other embodiments, cap portion 104 can be designed so that no portion extends overtop the exterior of the vascular access device. In essence, a cap portion 104 can be defined as the portion of the obturator that the user grips to insert and remove the obturator from a vascular access device. In many cases, cap portion 104 will also form a cover overtop the proximal opening of the vascular access device, but this is not required by the invention. [0030] Although this description describes an obturator as including distinct catheter, middle, base, and cap portions, the intent of this description is to assist in the understanding of the invention and should not be construed as limiting the claims. In particular, an obturator in accordance with the present invention could be configured only with distinct cap and catheter portions with the cap portion being the portion that a user grips and the catheter portion extending distally from the cap portion. [0031] In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, obturator 100 can also include an antimicrobial coating on one or more portions. The location of the antimicrobial coating can be selected so that the antimicrobial coating will be in contact with residual fluid that remains within the vascular access device after use. As this residual fluid contacts the antimicrobial coating, one or more antimicrobial agents contained within the coating can be dispersed (e.g. eluted or dissolved) into the residual fluid thereby sterilizing or maintaining the sterility of the fluid. In this way, the risk of microbial colonization within the vascular access device is reduced. [0032] As depicted in Figures 1A-1C, an antimicrobial coating 110 (which is not visible in these figures) can be applied to catheter portion 101. Antimicrobial coating 110 can extend along any length of catheter portion 110. As depicted in these figures, antimicrobial coating extends from a distal tip of catheter portion 101 to middle portion 102. In some embodiments, antimicrobial coating 110 could also extend along middle portion 102 and/or base portion 103. In other embodiments, antimicrobial coating 110 may only be applied on middle portion 102 and/or base portion 103. [0033] As shown in Figure 1C, obturator 100 can be inserted into a peripheral intravenous catheter 150 (or another vascular access device). Peripheral intravenous catheter 150 comprises a catheter adapter 152 having a lumen 153, and a catheter 151 that extends distally from catheter adapter 152. As shown, obturator 100 can be inserted into peripheral intravenous catheter 150 so that catheter portion 101 extends into catheter 151. Cap portion 104 can be configured to extend overtop the proximal end/opening of catheter adapter 152. [0034] In the example shown in Figure 1C, base portion 103 is configured with a diameter that is substantially the same as the diameter of lumen 153. Therefore, when obturator 100 is fully inserted into peripheral intravenous catheter 150, base portion 103 forms a seal within lumen 153. Also, with obturator 100 fully inserted, the proximal end of catheter portion 101 is positioned within lumen 153. As such, a portion of catheter portion 101 that includes antimicrobial coating 110 is contained within lumen 153. In this way, any residual fluid within lumen 153 can come in contact with antimicrobial coating 110 which enables the antimicrobial agents contained within antimicrobial coating to be dispensed within the fluid. Similarly, any fluid that remains within catheter 151 will be in contact with antimicrobial coating 110 on the length of catheter portion 101 that is positioned within catheter 151. Therefore, the antimicrobial agents can be dispensed from obturator 100 both within catheter 151 and lumen 153. [0035] Figures 2A-2C illustrate another example embodiment of an obturator configured in accordance with the present invention. Figure 2A illustrates a perspective view of an obturator 200 that is configured to be inserted within a peripheral intravenous catheter or another vascular access device, Figure 2B illustrates a cross-sectional view of obturator 200, and Figure 2C illustrates a cross-sectional view of obturator 200 when inserted into a peripheral intravenous catheter 250. [0036] Obturator 200, like obturator 100, includes a catheter portion 201, a middle portion 202, a base portion 203, and a cap portion 204. In some embodiments, obturator 200 may also include antimicrobial coating 110, as described above, on catheter portion 201. However, in describing Figures 2A-2C, it will be assumed that obturator 200 does not include antimicrobial coating 110. [0037] In accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, obturator 200 can also include an antimicrobial ring 210. Antimicrobial ring 210 can comprise a material that contains one or more antimicrobial agents. As will be further described below, the antimicrobial agents can be contained within the material or on the surface (e.g. as a coating) of the material from which the ring is made. The location of antimicrobial ring 210 can be selected so that the antimicrobial ring will be in contact with residual fluid that remains within the vascular access device after use. As this residual fluid contacts the antimicrobial ring, one or more antimicrobial agents contained within the ring can be dispersed (e.g. eluted or dissolved) into the residual fluid thereby sterilizing or maintaining the sterility of the fluid. In this way, the risk of microbial colonization within the vascular access device is reduced. [0038] As shown in Figures 2A-2C, antimicrobial ring 210 is positioned around middle portion 202. Therefore, antimicrobial ring 210 will be positioned within lumen 253 when obturator 200 is inserted into peripheral intravenous catheter 250 as is shown in Figure 2C. Because antimicrobial ring 210 is positioned within lumen 253, any residual fluid contained in lumen 253 can come in contact with antimicrobial ring 210 thereby causing the antimicrobial agents contained in or on antimicrobial ring 210 to be dispersed into the fluid. [0039] As stated above, in some embodiments, antimicrobial ring 210 can be used on an obturator that also includes an antimicrobial coating 110 on its catheter portion. Using both can ensure that adequate amounts of antimicrobial agents are dispensed in both the catheter and lumen of the catheter adapter since antimicrobial ring 210 can account for the increased amount of antimicrobial agents required to effectively treat the larger volume of the lumen. [0040] In addition to a ring, antimicrobial components of other shapes can also be employed. For example, many differently shaped antimicrobial components can be affixed to an obturator at various locations to provide antimicrobial benefits to a vascular access device. Accordingly, an obturator in accordance with the present invention may include one or more antimicrobial components that are affixed or otherwise secured to the obturator. [0041] Various types of antimicrobial coatings can be employed on obturators in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, an alcohol- based formulation containing one or more antimicrobial agents can be applied to the surface (e.g. catheter portion 101) of the obturator such as by dipping or spraying. Once applied, the alcohol can dissolve from the surface leaving behind a residue containing the antimicrobial agents thereby forming the antimicrobial coating. In such embodiments, the antimicrobial coating thus formed will dissolve into the fluid within the vascular access device. Using a dissolvable antimicrobial coating can be preferred in many applications where an obturator will be used over a relatively shorter duration of time since the rapid dissolving of the coating results in a quick release of the antimicrobial agents into the fluid. Examples of suitable formulations and methods that can be used to apply the formulations on an obturator are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 13/438,559, titled Systems and Methods for Applying a Novel Antimicrobial Coating Material to a Medical Device which is incorporated by reference. [0042] In other embodiments, an antimicrobial coating can be formed of a matrix that includes one or more antimicrobial agents. For example, the matrix can be a polymer or other suitable material that is cured (e.g. via UV curing) or otherwise bonded to the surface of the obturator. In such coatings, the antimicrobial agent will be eluted from the matrix coating in a controlled fashion. Examples of suitable matrixes and methods of applying the matrixes that can be employed to form an antimicrobial coating on an obturator are described in U.S. Patent No. 8,512,294, titled Vascular Access Device Antimicrobial Materials and Solutions; and U.S. Patent Application Nos. 12/397,760, titled Antimicrobial Compositions; 12/476,997, titled Antimicrobial Coating Compositions; 12/490,235, titled Systems and Methods for Applying an Antimicrobial Coating to a Medical Device; and 12/831,880, titled Antimicrobial Coating for Dermally Invasive Devices; each of which is incorporated by reference. [0043] In some embodiments, an antimicrobial component (e.g. a ring) can be formed of any suitable material and can have an antimicrobial coating formed of either an alcohol-based formulation or a base material matrix and antimicrobial agents as described in the previous paragraphs. In other embodiments, the material from which the antimicrobial component is made can comprise the base material matrix and the antimicrobial agents. In other words, an antimicrobial component can be comprised entirely of a base material matrix or can only have a coating comprised of either the base material matrix or the alcohol-based formulation. In either case, an antimicrobial component can be bonded or mechanically connected to an obturator. [0044] In embodiments of the invention, an obturator can be configured with one or more of the three general types of antimicrobial protection described above. In other words, an obturator can include an antimicrobial coating formed using an alcohol-based formulation, an antimicrobial coating formed of a base material matrix, and an antimicrobial component (whether formed entirely of a base material matrix, having only a coating of a base material matrix, or having a coating of an alcohol-based formulation). Various combinations of these types of antimicrobial protection can be employed on an obturator to give the obturator the desired antimicrobial properties when used within a vascular access device. [0045] In many obturator designs, the catheter portion and base portion of the obturator form seals at opposite ends of the vascular access device effectively creating a locked volume of fluid within the vascular access device. Based on a typical volume of fluid that can be expected to exist within a vascular access device, an obturator can be configured with an appropriate antimicrobial coating and/or component to ensure that the typical volume of fluid will be adequately treated. [0046] To provide an appropriate amount of antimicrobial agents, various factors can be considered including the total surface area or amount (e.g. in weight) of the antimicrobial coating on the obturator, the concentration of the antimicrobial agents within the coating or material, the rate at which the coating or material will elute or dispense the antimicrobial agents, and the type of antimicrobial agent. For example, to achieve a typical inhibitory concentration of 20 ppm for pseudomonas aeruginosa in a locked volume of 0.16 cc of fluid within a catheter adapter over a 24 hour period, 3.2 μg of chlorhexidine would need to be released from the obturator. Additionally, to attain a typical bacteriocidal concentration of 500 ppm for pseudomonas aeruginosa, a minimum of 80 μg of chlorhexidine would need to be released from the obturator. Accordingly, in an embodiment where the obturator includes an antimicrobial coating formed using an alcohol-based formulation (i.e. a coating from which the agents dissolve) and the obturator is desired to provide protection against pseudomonas aeruginosa, an antimicrobial coating having a minimum target weight may range from 3.5 to 81 μg (depending on whether an inhibitory or bacteriocidal concentration is desired). On the other hand, in an embodiment where the obturator includes an antimicrobial coating or component comprised of a base material matrix containing antimicrobial agents (i.e. a coating or component that elutes the agents) and it is desired that the obturator provide antimicrobial protection for a 24 hour period, an antimicrobial coating or component having a surface area as small as 2.5 mm may be suitable. [0047] The above examples illustrate that the specific weight of a dissolving antimicrobial coating or surface area of an eluting antimicrobial coating/component can be selected based on the targeted microorganism, the desired antimicrobial effect (e.g. inhibitory or bacteriocidal concentration), the desired duration for which the antimicrobial agents will be effective, the release kinetics (e.g. rate of dissolution or elution) of the coating/component, and the type of antimicrobial agent used (e.g. chlorhexidine gluconate and chlorhexidine diacetate). [0048] One benefit of employing an obturator to distribute antimicrobial agents within a vascular access device between uses of the device is that the obturator can be modified to include an antimicrobial coating and/or component without modifying how the obturator is used. The obturator is therefore a simple means for placing antimicrobial agents in the precise location within the device and at the precise time when they are needed. Another benefit is that an obturator can be provided with an antimicrobial coating and/or component that is configured to distribute a precise amount of antimicrobial agent to the internal volume of the device. As described above, the coating and/or component can be customized based on various factors to provide the necessary amount of antimicrobial agents for a given volume and for a desired purpose. [0049] Figures 3 A and 3B provide an example of how an antimicrobial coating 310 on an obturator can disperse antimicrobial agents into fluid contained within a vascular access device. In these figures, the antimicrobial coating is represented using the white dots shown on the catheter portion of the obturator. Figure 3B illustrates that when the obturator is placed within the vascular access device, antimicrobial agents are dispersed into the fluid which is represented by the black dots being dispersed throughout the lumen of the device. In this example, it is assumed that the lumen is full of fluid. However, the antimicrobial agent can be dispersed to fluid within the lumen even when the fluid does not fill the lumen. [0050] Figures 4A and 4B provide an example of how an antimicrobial ring 410 on an obturator can disperse antimicrobial agents into fluid contained within a vascular access device. As with Figure 3B, Figure 4B illustrates that antimicrobial agents (represented as white dots) contained within or on the antimicrobial component are dispersed into fluid (represented as black dots) contained within the lumen of the device. [0051] The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics.
