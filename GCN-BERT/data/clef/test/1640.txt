Step 4
5-Chloro-2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (52)
To a solution of 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (20 g, 144.92 mmol) in diethyl ether (500 mL) was added drop wise sulfuryl chloride (14 mL, 171.2 mmol) at 0° C. under argon and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was poured into ice-water, the organic layer was separated and washed with water, brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to give the crude product, which was purified on a silica gel column (pet. ether:ethyl acetate=90:10) to get 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde as an off white solid. (6.7 g, 26%, LC/MS; 97%). ES−, m/z 170.9 [M−H]; [C7H5ClO3]; NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz): δ 11.39 (1H, s), 10.87 (1H, s), 9.98 (1H, s), 7.0 (1H, s), 6.58 (1H, s).
