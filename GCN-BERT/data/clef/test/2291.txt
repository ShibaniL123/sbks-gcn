The present invention concerns a dialysis machine with haemolysis control. Dialysis is a method for cleansing the blood, able to restore the hydrosaline balance and eliminate the excess water and toxic substances that accumulate in the organism during kidney failure, releasing them to a liquid with electrolytic content analogous to that of the normal plasma that does not contain them; here and below said liquid will be indicated by the term "dialysing solution". In application of said method, once the blood has been taken from the patient's arm, it is conveyed through the so-called arterial line and enters the dialyser; at the outlet of the dialyser, the blood is conveyed through the venous line and returns, cleansed, to the patient. The technique of haemodiafiltration, to which the description refers without loss of generality, entails cleansing of the blood by exploiting the phenomenon of both diffusion and convection. Cleansing by diffusion is due to balancing of the concentrations of the blood and dialysing solution which flow on opposite sides of a semi-permeable membrane, whereas cleansing by convection occurs when a pressure gradient is created between the dialysing solution compartment and the blood compartment, said gradient being favourable to the latter. In this way, via the semi-permeable membrane, there is a passage of plasmatic water and, with it, the toxic substances dissolved therein. The dialysing solution does not contain the substances to be eliminated from the blood such as urea, uric acid, creatinine, phosphorous etc., but it contains a precise quantity of other substances to be re-balanced such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium etc. As is known, many of the patients requiring dialysis treatment suffer from massive haemolysis, a pathology involving destruction of the red blood cells greater than the physiological destruction of 1-2% per day of the population of red blood cells. For these patients it is therefore particularly important for haemolysis in the blood to be monitored also during dialysis. The European Patent Application EP1342479 A(1) describes an assembly for controlling and regulating flow of a dialysis solution in a haemodiafiltration process, having a first and a second pump located respectively along a dialysis solution inlet branch and outlet branch of a haemodialysis filter; a differential flowmeter for reading the difference in flow of the dialysis solution in and out of the filter; and a central control unit for receiving information from the differential flowmeter, and making a calculated variation in the delivery of the pump, so as to periodically regulate the pressure of the dialysis solution in the filter, and impose alternate calculated flow of the dialysis solution and the plasma water through the membrane of the filter. The US Patent Application US2001/020122 A(1) describes systems and methods for noninvasively measuring the levels of urea, blood osmolarity (or Na+), plasma free hemoglobin and tissue water content in a patient's blood or tissue. Light of selected wavelengths is passed through blood or body tissue and the transmitted or reflected light is detected and the detected signals can be electronically compared and manipulated to provide the non-invasive, continuous and quantitative display of a patient's blood urea, blood osmolarity (or Na+), plasma free hemoglobin and tissue water content. The object of the present invention is to produce a dialysis machine, the technical characteristics of which are such as to ensure control of the haemolysis value in the patient's blood during dialysis treatment. The subject of the present invention is a dialysis machine as claimed in Claim 1. According to a first preferred embodiment of the dialysis machine of the present invention, the measuring device is applied on said arterial line. According to a second preferred embodiment of the dialysis machine of the present invention, the measuring device is applied on said venous line. According to a third preferred embodiment, the dialysis machine of the present invention comprises an isolated ultrafiltration device arranged along the arterial line of the patient's blood, from which a branch starts suitable for conveying the components of the blood and on which the haemoglobin concentration measuring device is applied. The following examples are provided for illustrative nonlimiting purposes, for a better understanding of the invention with the help of the figures of the attached drawings, in which: figure 1 is a schematic view of part of a first preferred embodiment of the dialysis machine according to the present invention; andfigure 2 is a schematic view of part of a second preferred embodiment of the dialysis machine according to the present invention. In figure 1, the number 1 indicates overall a first preferred embodiment of the dialysis machine (illustrated only partially) according to the present invention. The machine 1 comprises a dialysis filter 2 (known and not described in detail), an arterial line 3 which is responsible for conveying the blood from a patient P to the filter 2, a pump 3a applied to the arterial line 3 to guarantee movement of the blood, a venous line 4 responsible for conveying the blood from the filter 2 to the patient P, an inlet branch 5 and an outlet branch 6 of a dialysing solution into and out of the filter 2, a preparation device 7 for the dialysing solution connected to the inlet branch 5, a device for measuring the concentration of haemoglobin 8 applied to the outlet branch 6, a pair of pumps 9 and 10 applied to the inlet branch 5 and to the outlet branch 6 of the dialysing solution respectively, and a command and control unit 11. The command and control unit 11 is connected to the haemoglobin concentration measuring device 8 to receive the data from it. Figure 1 shows two possible variations in which the haemoglobin concentration measuring device is indicated by a broken line. In particular, in a first possible variation, a measuring device indicated by 8a is applied along the arterial line 3, while in a second possible variation, a measuring device indicated by 8b is applied along the venous line 4. In figure 2, the number 13 indicates as a whole a second preferred embodiment of the dialysis machine (illustrated only partially) according to the present invention. The parts of the machine 13 equal to those of the machine 1 will be indicated by the same numbering and will not be described again. The machine 13 differs from the machine 1 substantially to comprise an isolated ultrafiltration device 14 arranged along the arterial line 3. The isolated ultrafiltration device 14 can produce plasmatic water or plasma depending on whether it is a haemofilter or a plasma filter respectively. The plasmatic water or the plasma produced flow into a branch line 15, to which a pump 16 is applied. Generally, the branch line 15 comprises an adsorption cleansing device and re-connects to the arterial line 3 in the section between the isolated ultrafiltration device 14 and the haemodialysis filter 2. As illustrated in figure 2, the machine 13 entails application of the haemoglobin concentration measuring device 8 on the branch line 15 and connection, as for the machine 1, to the command and control unit 12. The measuring device 8 is an optical sensor and, as may be obvious from a study of the present invention, the type of measuring device is in no way binding and therefore cannot be limiting. The dialysis machine subject of the present invention allows continuous monitoring of the haemoglobin concentration in the blood of the patient undergoing dialysis. If the haemolysis sensor reveals an abnormal concentration of haemoglobin, the machine not only signals the abnormality but also acts on the pumping systems to lower the pressures in the various points of the extracorporeal circuit. In particular, the control unit 11, once it has recorded an abnormal haemolysis value, activates an intervention system (not illustrated for the sake of simplicity) both to signal the abnormal haemoglobin value and to modify the pressure regimes acting on the pumping systems.
