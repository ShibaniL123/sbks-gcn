(rac)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic Acid, Allyl Ester (XVI)
(rac)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-methyl-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid allyl ester (IX) (500 g, 0.962 mol) was prepared at 20° C. in THF (2.51) and combined with a 1 M solution of sodium hexamethyldisilazide (NaHMDS) in THF (203 g; 1.107 mol). After 10 min of stirring, dimethylsulfate (243 g; 1.925 mol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at RT. The reaction mixture was added to a solution of 26% aqueous ammonia solution (315 g; 4.812 mol) in 3 l of water and rinsed with 250 ml of THF. Stirring was done overnight, then cooled to 5° C. The product was filtered off and washed with water (1 l). Drying was done at 40° C. in vacuum.
Yield: 443 g (86% of theory) of a beige-colored solid.
