STORAGE STABLE SOLUTIONS OF OPTICAL BRIGHTENERS The instant invention relates to storage stable solutions of optical brighteners based on derivatives of diaminostilbene which do not need extra solubilising additives. It is well known that the whiteness and thereby the attractiveness of paper, board, textile and non-woven products can be improved by the addition of optical brightening agents (OBAs). The most important optical brighteners in the paper and board industry are anilino-substituted bistriazinyl derivatives of 4,4’-diaminostilbene-2,2’-disulphonic acid. The anilino-substituent may contain additional sulphonic acid groups, which provide a greater water-solubility. The optical brightener of formula (A, M=Na) in which the anilino-substituent contain no sulphonic acid groups has a particularly high affinity for cellulose fibres and is especially suitable for use at the wet-end of the paper making process. For ease of handling and metering, the paper and board industry demands that optical brighteners be supplied in a liquid form, preferably in the form of a concentrated aqueous solution. Furthermore, the liquid form has to be stable to prolonged storage over a wide temperature range, typically 4 to 50°C. In the past, solubilising auxiliaries such as urea or ethylene glycol have been added in amounts of up to 30% by weight in order to provide aqueous solutions of (A) which are stable to storage. These solubilising agents have no affinity for cellulose, however, and contaminate the effluent from the paper mill. EP-A-884 312 provides a partial solution to this problem by disclosing that certain hydrates of (A, including M=Na) may be used to produce stable liquid suspensions or slurries containing low amounts of formulation auxiliaries. EP-A-1 300 514 offers another partial solution by disclosing concentrated aqueous brightener preparations of (A, including M=Na) which remain stable at elevated temperatures of between 40 and 98°C. WO 2007/017336 Α1 discloses storage stable solutions of optical brighteners based on certain salt forms of anilino-substituted bistriazinyl derivatives of 4, 4’-diaminostilbene-2,2’-disulphonic acid which do not need extra solubilising additives. WO 2005/028749 Α1 discloses optical brightener compositions comprising an alkanolamine and an optical brightener of formula A (Μ=Η). Preferred alkanolamines are 2-amino-2-methyl-1 -propanol, 1 -amino-2-propanol or a mixture of 2-amino-2-methyl-1 propanol and 2-(N-methylamino)-2-methyl-l-propanol. Japanese Kokai 62-273266 claims optical brightener compositions comprising quaternary ammonium salts of anionic bis(triazinylamino) stilbene derivatives. The preferred quaternary ammonium ion is a trimethyl-B-hydroxyethylammonium ion. The demand remains for stable, concentrated aqueous solutions of disulphonated optical brighteners, which are free from solubilising auxiliaries. It has now surprisingly been found that a specific salt form of (A) in combination with small amounts of organic acids enables stable concentrated solutions to be formed, without the addition of solubilising auxiliaries. The present invention therefore provides an aqueous solution containing 10 to 40% by weight of a compound of formula (1) in which R is hydrogen or a methyl radical, M+ is Li+, Na+, or K+, and η is less than or equal to 1.5, and of 0.05 to 5 % by weight of an organic acid selected from citric acid, glycolic acid, acetic acid or formic acid. As demonstrated by example 5 the use of organic acids instead of hydrochloric acid (as used in WO 2007/017336 Α1 with a similar optical brightener) leads to a much better storage stability. Preferred are aqueous solutions containing 15 to 35% by weight of a compound of formula (1) in which R is hydrogen or a methyl radical, M+ is Na+, and η is less than or equal to 1.5, and of 0.1 to 2 % by weight of citric acid. More preferred are aqueous solutions in which R is hydrogen, M+ is Na+, and η is less than or equal to 1.5. Especially preferred are aqueous solutions in which R is hydrogen, M+ is Na+, and η is less than or equal to 1.2. The present invention also provides a process for the production of the above aqueous solutions, the process being characterised in that a compound of formula (2) wherein R is hydrogen or a methyl radical, in the form of an aqueous solution is converted to a mixed salt form (1) in which at least 25% of the M+ ions associated with the sulphonate groups have been replaced by (CH3)2NH+CH2CH2OH ions, by treatment with 2-dimethylaminoethanol and an organic acid (for example acetic, formic, tartaric or citric acid). The instant aqueous solutions may optionally contain one or more carriers, antifreezes, defoamers, solubilizing aids, preservatives, complexing agents etc., as well as organic by-products formed during the preparation of the optical brightener. Carriers are known to give improved whitening characteristics to pigmented coating brightener compositions and may be, e.g., polyethylene glycols, polyvinyl alcohols or carboxymethylcelluloses. Antifreezes may be, e.g., urea, diethylene glycol or triethylene glycol. Solubilizing aids may be, e.g., urea, triethanolamine, triisopropanolamine or 2-dimethylamino ethano 1. The instant aqueous solutions are suitable for use as optical brighteners for the whitening of textiles, paper, board and non-wovens. They are particularly useful for the whitening of paper and board, and are suitable for application either to an aqueous suspension of pulp, or to the surface of paper, especially in a pigmented coating composition. They are characterized by high storage stability, yield and ease of application. They are also highly compatible with other additives conventionally employed in the production of cellulosic articles, especially paper and board. EXAMPLES The following examples shall demonstrate the instant invention in more details. If not indicated otherwise, "parts" means "parts by weight" and "%" means "% by weight". EXAMPLE 1 220 parts of diethanolamine are added at 60°C to a stirred suspension of 824 parts of a compound of formula (3) in 7750 parts water. The mixture is heated to reflux and maintained there for 4 hours while controlling the pH to 8.5-9.0 by the addition of sodium hydroxide in the form of a 30% aqueous solution. 44 parts of sodium chloride are added, and the mixture is stirred at reflux for a further 10 minutes. The mixture is then cooled to 90°C before stirring is stopped. After standing for 10 minutes, the lower phase of oil (1990 parts) containing a compound of formula (A, M=Na) is separated from the salt-containing aqueous phase and added at 80°C with stirring to 1570 parts cold water.

After standing for 1 hour, the lower phase of oil is separated, and diluted with water to give 4400 parts of an aqueous solution containing 22.4% of a compound of formula (5). The aqueous solution so-formed precipitates within 4 days on storage at 4°C in the presence of crystal seeds.

The solution so-formed is then treated at 50°C with a solution of 196 parts 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanol in 350 parts cold water and 127 parts citric acid. The mixture is stirred at 50°C for 10 minutes, then cooled to 20°C. After standing for 1 hour, the lower phase of oil is separated, and diluted with water to 5000 parts. After standing for 1 hour, the lower phase of oil is separated, and diluted with water to give 4400 parts of an aqueous solution containing 22.0% of a compound of formula (6). The aqueous solution so-formed precipitates within 4 days on storage at 4°C in the presence of crystal seeds.
