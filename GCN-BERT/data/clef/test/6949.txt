PRIORITY CLAIM This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional application Ser. Nos. 61/508,861, filed on Jul. 18, 2011, and 61/526,342, filed on Aug. 23, 2011, which are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds of formula (I) wherein W1, W2, R1 to R7, R6, X and Y have the meaning according to the claims, and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of formulas (I) can be used as positive allosteric modulators of the follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR). Objects of the invention are also pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of formula (I), and the use of the compounds of formula (I) for the treatment of fertility disorders. BACKGROUND Gonadotropins serve important functions in a variety of bodily functions including metabolism, temperature regulation and the reproductive process. Gonadotropins act on specific gonadal cell types to initiate ovarian and testicular differentiation and steroidogenesis. The gonadotropin FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) is released from the anterior pituitary under the influence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and estrogens, and from the placenta during pregnancy. FSH is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone that shares structural similarities with luteinizing hormone (LH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), both of which are also produced in the pituitary gland, and chorionic gonadotropin (CG), which is produced in the placenta. In the female, FSH plays a pivotal role in the stimulation of follicle development and maturation and in addition, it is the major hormone regulating secretion of estrogens, whereas LH induces ovulation. In the male, FSH is responsible for the integrity of the seminiferous tubules and acts on Sertoli cells to support gametogenesis. The hormones are relatively large (28-38 kDa) and are composed of a common α-subunit non-covalently bound to a distinct β-subunit that confers receptor binding specificity. The cellular receptor for these hormones is expressed on testicular Sertoli cells and ovarian granulosa cells. The FSH receptor is known to be members of the G protein-coupled class of membrane-bound receptors, which when activated stimulate an increase in the activity of adenylyl cyclase. This results in an increase in the level of the intracellular second messenger adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP), which in turn causes increased steroid synthesis and secretion. Hydropathicity plots of the amino acid sequences of these receptors reveal three general domains: a hydrophilic amino-terminal region, considered to be the amino-terminal extracellular domain; seven hydrophobic segments of membrane-spanning length, considered to be the transmembrane domain; and a carboxy-terminal region that contains potential phosphorylation sites (serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues), considered to be the carboxy-terminal intracellular or cytoplasmic domain. The glycoprotein hormone receptor family is distinguished from other G protein-coupled receptors, such as the β-2-adrenergic, rhodopsin, and substance K receptors, by the large size of the hydrophilic amino-terminal domain, which is involved in hormone binding. Annually in the U.S. there are 2.4 million couples experiencing infertility that are potential candidates for treatment. FSH, either extracted from urine or produced by recombinant DNA technology, is a parenterally-administered protein product used by specialists for ovulation induction and for controlled ovarial hyperstimulation. Whereas ovulation induction is directed at achieving a single follicle to ovulate, controlled ovarial hyperstimulation is directed at harvesting multiple oocytes for use in various in-vitro assisted reproductive technologies, e.g. in-vitro fertilization (IVF). FSH is also used clinically to treat male hypogonadism and male infertility, e.g. some types of failure of spermatogenesis. FSHR is a highly specific target in the ovarian follicle growth process and is exclusively expressed in the ovary. However, the use of FSH is limited by its high cost, lack of oral dosing, and need of extensive monitoring by specialist physicians. Hence, identification of a non-peptidic small molecule substitute for FSH that could potentially be developed for oral administration is desirable. Low molecular weight FSH mimetics with agonistic properties are disclosed in the international applications WO 2002/09706 and WO 2010/136438 as well as the U.S. Pat. No. 6,653,338. Furthermore, WO 2009/105435 is directed to 3-(amido or sulphamido)-4-(4-substituted-azinyl)-benzamides which are useful as an inhibitor of the chemokine receptor CXCR3, and for preventing or treating a CXCR3-mediated disease, e.g. inflammation. There is still a need for low molecular weight hormone mimetics that selectively activate FSHR.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the meaning of the present invention, the compound is defined to include pharmaceutically usable derivatives, solvates, prodrugs, tautomers, enantiomers, racemates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. The term “pharmaceutically usable derivatives” is taken to mean, for example, the salts of the compounds according to the invention and also so-called prodrug compounds. The term “solvates” of the compounds is taken to mean adductions of inert solvent molecules onto the compounds, which are formed owing to their mutual attractive force. Solvates are, for example, mono- or dihydrates or alkoxides. The invention also comprises solvates of salts of the compounds according to the invention. The term “prodrug” is taken to mean compounds according to the invention which have been modified by means of, for example, alkyl or acyl groups, sugars or oligopeptides and which are rapidly cleaved in the organism to form the effective compounds according to the invention. These also include biodegradable polymer derivatives of the compounds according to the invention, as described, for example, in Int. J. Pharm. 115, 61-67 (1995). It is likewise possible for the compounds of the invention to be in the form of any desired prodrugs such as, for example, esters, carbonates, carbamates, ureas, amides or phosphates, in which cases the actually biologically active form is released only through metabolism. Any compound that can be converted in-vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e. compounds of the invention) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art and are described (e.g. Wermuth C G et al., Chapter 31: 671-696, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Academic Press 1996; Bundgaard H, Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier 1985; Bundgaard H, Chapter 5: 131-191, A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Harwood Academic Publishers 1991). Said references are incorporated herein by reference. It is further known that chemical substances are converted in the body into metabolites which may where appropriate likewise elicit the desired biological effect—in some circumstances even in more pronounced form. Any biologically active compound that was converted in-vivo by metabolism from any of the compounds of the invention is a metabolite within the scope and spirit of the invention. The compounds of the invention may be present in the form of their double bond isomers as pure E or Z isomers, or in the form of mixtures of these double bond isomers. Where possible, the compounds of the invention may be in the form of the tautomers, such as keto-enol tautomers. All stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention are contemplated, either in a mixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The compounds of the invention can have asymmetric centers at any of the carbon atoms. Consequently, they can exist in the form of their racemates, in the form of the pure enantiomers and/or diastereomers or in the form of mixtures of these enantiomers and/or diastereomers. The mixtures may have any desired mixing ratio of the stereoisomers. Thus, for example, the compounds of the invention which have one or more centers of chirality and which occur as racemates or as diastereomer mixtures can be fractionated by methods known per se into their optical pure isomers, i.e. enantiomers or diastereomers. The separation of the compounds of the invention can take place by column separation on chiral or nonchiral phases or by recrystallization from an optionally optically active solvent or with use of an optically active acid or base or by derivatization with an optically active reagent such as, for example, an optically active alcohol, and subsequent elimination of the radical. The invention also relates to the use of mixtures of the compounds according to the invention, for example mixtures of two diastereomers, for example in the ratio 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:10, 1:100 or 1:1000. These are particularly preferably mixtures of stereoisomeric compounds. The nomenclature as used herein for defining compounds, especially the compounds according to the invention, is in general based on the rules of the IUPAC-organization for chemical compounds and especially organic compounds. The terms indicated for explanation of the above compounds of the invention always, unless indicated otherwise in the description or in the claims, have the following meanings: The term “unsubstituted” means that the corresponding radical, group or moiety has no substituents. The term “substituted” means that the corresponding radical, group or moiety has one or more substituents. Where a radical has a plurality of substituents, and a selection of various substituents is specified, the substituents are selected independently of one another and do not need to be identical. Even though a radical has a plurality of a specific-designated substituent (e.g. Y2 or YY) the expression of such substituent may differ from each other (e.g. methyl and ethyl). It shall be understood accordingly that a multiple substitution by any radical of the invention may involve identical or different radicals. Hence, if individual radicals occur several times within a compound, the radicals adopt the meanings indicated, independently of one another. In case of a multiple substitution, the radical could be alternatively designated with R′, R″, R′″ etc. The terms “alkyl” or “A” refer to acyclic saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals, which may be branched or straight-chain and preferably have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carbon atoms, i.e. C1-C10-alkanyls.

The benzamide derivatives according to formula (I) and the starting materials for its preparation, respectively, are produced by methods known per se, as described in the literature (for example in standard works, such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart), i.e. under reaction conditions that are known and suitable for said reactions. Use can also be made of variants that are known per se, but are not mentioned in greater detail herein. If desired, the starting materials can also be formed in-situ by leaving them in the un-isolated status in the crude reaction mixture, but immediately converting them further into the compound according to the invention. On the other hand, it is possible to carry out the reaction stepwise. The reactions are preferably performed under basic conditions. Suitable bases are metal oxides, e.g. aluminum oxide, alkaline metal hydroxide (potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide, inter alia), alkaline earth metal hydroxide (barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, inter alia), alkaline metal alcoholates (potassium ethanolate and sodium propanolate, inter alia) and several organic bases (piperidine or diethanolamine, inter alia). The reaction is generally carried out in an inert solvent. Suitable inert solvents are, for example, hydrocarbons, such as hexane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene or xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as trichloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform or dichloromethane; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane; glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme); ketones, such as acetone or butanone; amides, such as acetamide, dimethylacetamide or dimethylformamide (DMF); nitriles, such as acetonitrile; sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); carbon disulfide; carboxylic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); nitro compounds, such as nitromethane or nitrobenzene; esters, such as ethyl acetate, or mixtures of the said solvents. Particular preference is given to TFA, H2O, THF, tert. butanol, tert. amylalcohol, triethylamine or dioxane. Depending on the conditions used, the reaction time is between a few minutes and 14 days, the reaction temperature is between about −30° C. and 140° C., normally between −10° C. and 130° C., preferably between 30° C. and 125° C. The present invention also relates to a process for manufacturing compounds of formula (I) comprising the steps of: (a) reacting a compound of formula (II) wherein W1, W2, R3 to R7, R8, X and Y have the meaning as defined above, in the presence of a crosslinking agent and a solvent with a compound of formula (III) wherein R1 and R2 have the meaning as defined above, to yield a compound of formula (I) wherein W1, W2, R1 to R7, R8, X and Y have the meaning as defined above, and optionally (b) converting a base or an acid of the compound of formula (I) into a salt thereof. The benzamide derivatives of formula (I) are accessible via the route above. The starting materials, including the compounds of formulae (II) and (III), are usually known to the skilled artisan, or they can be easily prepared by known methods. Accordingly, any compound of formulae (II) and (III) can be purified, provided as intermediate product and used as starting material for the preparation of compounds of formula (I). The process step (a) is preferably performed in the presence of a crosslinking agent which is a carbodiimide derivative, particularly 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), and/or in the presence of a solvent, which is an organic acid, particularly TFA. It is more preferred in process step (a) to apply both EDC and TFA. In addition to tert. butyl carbamates (BOC), the skilled artisan knows other protection groups to be used in the compound of formula (III). The compounds of formula (I) can be modified, like hydrogenated or metal-reduced, to remove the chlorine, or put into a substitution reaction, and/or to be transformed with an acid or base into a salt, preferably with a strong acid. Numerous papers and methods are available and useful for the one skilled in the art in respect for organic chemistry, chemical strategies and tactics, synthetic routes, protection of intermediates, cleavage and purification procedure, isolation and characterization. General chemical modifications are known to the one skilled in the art. Halogenation of aryls or hydroxy substitution by halogens of acids, alcohols, phenols, and their tautomeric structures can be preferably carried out by use of POCl3, or SOCl2, PCl5, SO2Cl2. In some instances oxalyl chloride is also useful. Temperatures can vary from 0° C. to reflux depending on the task to halogenate a pyridone structure or a carboxylic acid or a sulfonic acid. Time will also be adjusted from minutes to several hours or even over night. Similarly, alkylation, ether formation, ester formation, amide formation are known to the one skilled in the art. Arylation with aryl boronic acids can be performed in presence of a Pd catalyst, appropriate ligand and base, preferably a carbonate, phosphate, borate salt of sodium, potassium or cesium. Organic bases, like Et3N, DIPEA or the more basic DBU can also be used. Solvents can vary too, from toluene, dioxane, THF, diglyme, monoglyme, alcohols, DMF, DMA, NMP, acetonitrile, in some cases even water, and others. Commonly used catalysts like Pd (PPh3)4, or Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2 type precursors of PdO catalysts have advanced to more complex ones with more efficient ligands. In C—C arylations instead of boronic acids and esters (Stille coupling), aryl-trifluoroborate potassium salts (Suzuki-Miyaura coupling), organo silanes (Hiyama coupling), Grignard reagents (Kumada), zink organyles (Negishi coupling) and tin organyles (Stille coupling) are useful. This experience can be transferred to N- and O-arylations. Numerous papers and methods are available and useful for the one skilled in the art in respect of N-arylation and even of electron deficient anilines (Biscoe et al. JACS 130: 6686 (2008)), and with aryl chlorides and anilines (Fors et al. JACS 130: 13552 (2008) as well as for O-arylation by using Cu catalysis and Pd catalysis. In the final step of the processes above, a salt of the compounds according to formulae (I) to (III), preferably formula (I), is optionally provided. The said compounds according to the invention can be used in their final non-salt form. On the other hand, the present invention also encompasses the use of these compounds in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which can be derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases by procedures known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds according to the invention are for the most part prepared by conventional methods. If the compound according to the invention contains a carboxyl group, one of its suitable salts can be formed by the reaction of the compound with a suitable base to give the corresponding base-addition salt. Such bases are, for example, alkali metal hydroxides, including potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal alkoxides, for example potassium ethoxide and sodium propoxide; and various organic bases, such as piperidine, diethanolamine and N-methylglutamine. The aluminum salts of the compounds according to the invention are likewise included. In the case of certain compounds according to the invention, acid-addition salts can be formed by treating these compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable organic and inorganic acids, for example hydrogen halides, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide or hydrogen iodide, other mineral acids and corresponding salts thereof, such as sulfate, nitrate or phosphate and the like, and alkyl- and monoarylsulfonates, such as ethanesulfonate, toluenesulfonate and benzenesulfonate, and other organic acids and corresponding salts thereof, such as acetate, trifluoroacetate, tartrate, maleate, succinate, citrate, benzoate, salicylate, ascorbate and the like. Accordingly, pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salts of the compounds according to the invention include the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, arginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate), bisulfate, bisulfite, bromide, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, caprylate, chloride, chlorobenzoate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dihydrogenphosphate, dinitrobenzoate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, galacterate (from mucic acid), galacturonate, glucoheptanoate, gluconate, glutamate, glycerophosphate, hemisuccinate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, iodide, isethionate, isobutyrate, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate, metaphosphate, methanesulfonate, methylbenzoate, monohydrogenphosphate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, oleate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, phenylacetate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, phosphonate, phthalate, but this does not represent a restriction. With regard to that stated above, it can be seen that the expressions “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” and “physiologically acceptable salt”, which are used interchangeable herein, in the present connection are taken to mean an active ingredient which comprises a compound according to the invention in the form of one of its salts, in particular if this salt form imparts improved pharmacokinetic properties on the active ingredient compared with the free form of the active ingredient or any other salt form of the active ingredient used earlier. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of the active ingredient can also provide this active ingredient for the first time with a desired pharmacokinetic property which it did not have earlier and can even have a positive influence on the pharmacodynamics of this active ingredient with respect to its therapeutic efficacy in the body. Object of the present invention is also the use of compounds according to formula (I) and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof for modulating an FSH receptor, particularly in the presence of FSH. The term “modulation” denotes any change in FSHR-mediated signal transduction, which is based on the action of the specific inventive compounds capable to interact with the FSHR target in such a manner that makes recognition, binding and activating possible. The compounds are characterized by such a high affinity to FSHR, which ensures a reliable binding and preferably a positive allosteric modulation of FSHR. More preferably, the substances are mono-specific in order to guarantee an exclusive and directed recognition with the single FSHR target. In the context of the present invention, the term “recognition”—without being limited thereto—relates to any type of interaction between the specific compounds and the target, particularly covalent or non-covalent binding or association, such as a covalent bond, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, van der Waals forces, ion pairs, hydrogen bonds, ligand-receptor interactions, and the like. Such association may also encompass the presence of other molecules such as peptides, proteins or nucleotide sequences. The present receptor/ligand-interaction is characterized by high affinity, high selectivity and minimal or even lacking cross-reactivity to other target molecules to exclude unhealthy and harmful impacts to the treated subject. A preferred object of the present invention relates to a method for modulating an FSH receptor, preferably in a positive allosteric manner, wherein a system capable of expressing the FSH receptor, preferably expressing the FSH receptor, is contacted, preferably in the presence of FSH, with at least one compound of formula (I) according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof, under conditions such that said FSH receptor is modulated, preferably in a positive allosteric manner. Although a cellular system is preferred in the scope of the invention, an in-vitro translation system can be alternatively used which is based on the protein synthesis without living cells. The cellular system is defined to be any subject provided that the subject comprises cells. Hence, the cellular system can be selected from the group of single cells, cell cultures, tissues, organs and animals. The prior teaching of the present specification concerning the compounds of formula (I), including any preferred embodiment thereof, is valid and applicable without restrictions to the compounds according to formula (I) and their salts when used in the method for modulating FSHR. The compounds according to the invention preferably exhibit an advantageous biological activity, which is easily demonstrated in cell culture-based assays, for example assays as described herein or in prior art (cf. e.g. WO 2002109706, which is incorporated herein by reference). In such assays, the compounds according to the invention preferably exhibit and cause an agonistic effect. It is preferred that the compounds of the invention have an FSHR agonist activity, as expressed by an EC50 standard, of less than 10 μM, more preferably less than 1 μM, most preferably less than 0.5 μM, highly preferably less than 0.1 μM. “EC50” is the effective concentration of a compound at which 50% of the maximal response of that obtained with FSH would be obtained. As discussed herein, these signaling pathways are relevant for various diseases, preferably fertility disorders. Accordingly, the compounds according to the invention are useful in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases that are dependent on the said signaling pathways by interaction with one or more of the said signaling pathways. The present invention therefore relates to compounds according to the invention as modulators, preferably agonists, more preferably positive allosteric modulators, of the signaling pathways described herein, preferably of the FSHR-mediated signaling pathway. The compounds of the invention are supposed to bind to the intracellular receptor domain without a competitive interaction with FSH, but they act as an allosteric enhancer of FSH on its receptor. The non-competitive interaction refers to the nature of the agonist activity exhibited by the compounds of the invention, wherein the compounds activate FSHR without substantially reducing the magnitude of binding of FSH to FSHR. The method of the invention can be performed either in-vitro or in-vivo. The susceptibility of a particular cell to treatment with the compounds according to the invention can be particularly determined by in-vitro tests, whether in the course of research or clinical application. Typically, a culture of the cell is combined with a compound according to the invention at various concentrations for a period of time which is sufficient to allow the active agents to modulate FSHR activity, usually between about one hour and one week. In-vitro treatment can be carried out using cultivated cells from a biopsy sample or cell line. In a preferred aspect of the invention, a follicle cell is stimulated for maturation. The viable cells remaining after the treatment are counted and further processed. The host or patient can belong to any mammalian species, for example a primate species, particularly humans; rodents, including mice, rats and hamsters; rabbits; horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. Animal models are of interest for experimental investigations, providing a model for treatment of human disease. For identification of a signal transduction pathway and for detection of interactions between various signal transduction pathways, various scientists have developed suitable models or model systems, for example cell culture models and models of transgenic animals. For the determination of certain stages in the signal transduction cascade, interacting compounds can be utilized in order to modulate the signal. The compounds according to the invention can also be used as reagents for testing FSHR-dependent signal transduction pathways in animals and/or cell culture models or in the clinical diseases mentioned in this application. The use according to the previous paragraphs of the specification may be either performed in-vitro or in-vivo models. The modulation can be monitored by the techniques described in the course of the present specification. The in-vitro use is preferably applied to samples of humans suffering from fertility disorders. Testing of several specific compounds and/or derivatives thereof makes the selection of that active ingredient possible that is best suited for the treatment of the human subject. The in-vivo dose rate of the chosen derivative is advantageously pre-adjusted to the FSHR susceptibility and/or severity of disease of the respective subject with regard to the in-vitro data. Therefore, the therapeutic efficacy is remarkably enhanced. Moreover, the subsequent teaching of the present specification concerning the use of the compounds according to formula (I) and its derivatives for the production of a medicament for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment and/or monitoring is considered as valid and applicable without restrictions to the use of the compound for the modulation of FSHR activity if expedient. The invention furthermore relates to a medicament comprising at least one compound according to the invention and/or pharmaceutically usable derivatives, salts, solvates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios. Preferably, the invention relates to a medicament comprising at least one compound according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof. A “medicament” in the meaning of the invention is any agent in the field of medicine, which comprises one or more compounds of formula (I) or preparations thereof (e.g. a pharmaceutical composition or pharmaceutical formulation) and can be used in prophylaxis, therapy, follow-up or aftercare of patients who suffer from diseases, which are associated with FSHR activity, in such a way that a pathogenic modification of their overall condition or of the condition of particular regions of the organism could establish at least temporarily. Consequently, the invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient at least one compound of formula (I) according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof together with pharmaceutically tolerable adjuvants and/or excipients. It shall be understood that the compound of the invention is provided in an effective amount. In the meaning of the invention, an “adjuvant” denotes every substance that enables, intensifies or modifies a specific response against the active ingredient of the invention if administered simultaneously, contemporarily or sequentially. Known adjuvants for injection solutions are, for example, aluminum compositions, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, saponins, such as QS21, muramyldipeptide or muramyltripeptide, proteins, such as gamma-interferon or TNF, M59, squalen or polyols. Furthermore, the active ingredient may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments. A synergistic effect may be achieved by using more than one compound in the pharmaceutical composition, i.e. the compound of formula (I) is combined with at least another agent as active ingredient, which is either another compound of formula (I) or a compound of different structural scaffold. The active ingredients can be used either simultaneously or sequentially. The present compounds are suitable for combination with known fertility-inducing agents. Preferably, the other active pharmaceutical ingredient is selected from the group of FSH, α-FSH (Gonal F), β-FSH, LH, hMG and 2-(4-(2-chloro-1,2-diphenylethenyl)-phenoxy)-N,N-diethyl-ethanamine citrate (Chlomifene citrate). Further ovulation adjuncts are known to those of skill in the art (cf. e.g. WO 2002/09706, which is incorporated herein by reference) and are useful with the compounds of the present invention. The invention also relates to a set (kit) consisting of separate packs of an effective amount of a compound according to the invention and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, solvates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, and an effective amount of a further medicament active ingredient. The set comprises suitable containers, such as boxes, individual bottles, bags or ampoules. The set may, for example, comprise separate ampoules, each containing an effective amount of a compound according to the invention and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, solvates and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios, and an effective amount of a further medicament active ingredient in dissolved or lyophilized form. Pharmaceutical formulations can be adapted for administration via any desired suitable method, for example by oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) methods. Such formulations can be prepared using all processes known in the pharmaceutical art by, for example, combining the active ingredient with the excipient(s) or adjuvant(s). The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is produced in a known way using common solid or liquid carriers, diluents and/or additives and usual adjuvants for pharmaceutical engineering and with an appropriate dosage. The amount of excipient material that is combined with the active ingredient to produce a single dosage form varies depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Suitable excipients include organic or inorganic substances that are suitable for the different routes of administration, such as enteral (e.g. oral), parenteral or topical application, and which do not react with compounds of formula (I) or salts thereof. Examples of suitable excipients are water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, alkylene glycols, polyethylene glycols, glycerol triacetate, gelatin, carbohydrates, e.g. lactose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc and petroleum jelly. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration can be administered as separate units, such as, for example, capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or foam foods; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions comprising antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostatics and solutes, by means of which the formulation is rendered isotonic with the blood of the recipient to be treated; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, which may comprise suspension media and thickeners. The formulations can be administered in single-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and stored in freeze-dried (lyophilized) state, so that only the addition of the sterile carrier liquid, for example water for injection purposes, immediately before use is necessary. Injection solutions and suspensions prepared in accordance with the recipe can be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets. It goes without saying that, in addition to the above particularly mentioned constituents, the formulations may also comprise other agents usual in the art with respect to the particular type of formulation; thus, for example, formulations which are suitable for oral administration may comprise flavors. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition is adapted for oral administration. The preparations can be sterilized and/or can comprise auxiliaries, such as carrier proteins (e.g. serum albumin), lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, fillers, chelating agents, antioxidants, solvents, bonding agents, suspending agents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts (for influencing the osmotic pressure), buffer substances, colorants, flavorings and one or more further active substances, for example one or more vitamins. Additives are well known in the art, and they are used in a variety of formulations. Accordingly, the invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient at least one compound of formula (I) according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof together with pharmaceutically tolerable adjuvants for oral administration, optionally in combination with at least another active pharmaceutical ingredient. Both active pharmaceutical ingredients are particularly provided in effective amount. The prior teaching of the present specification concerning administration route and combination product, respectively, is valid and applicable without restrictions to the combination of both features if expedient. The terms “effective amount” or “effective dose” or “dose” are interchangeably used herein and denote an amount of the pharmaceutical compound having a prophylactically or therapeutically relevant effect on a disease or pathological conditions, i.e. which causes in a tissue, system, animal or human a biological or medical response which is sought or desired, for example, by a researcher or physician. A “prophylactic effect” reduces the likelihood of developing a disease or even prevents the onset of a disease. A “therapeutically relevant effect” relieves to some extent one or more symptoms of a disease or returns to normality either partially or completely one or more physiological or biochemical parameters associated with or causative of the disease or pathological conditions. In addition, the expression “therapeutically effective amount” denotes an amount which, compared with a corresponding subject who has not received this amount, has the following consequence: improved treatment, healing, prevention or elimination of a disease, syndrome, condition, complaint, disorder or side-effects or also the reduction in the advance of a disease, complaint or disorder. The expression “therapeutically effective amount” also encompasses the amounts which are effective for increasing normal physiological function. The respective dose or dosage range for administering the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is sufficiently high in order to achieve the desired prophylactic or therapeutic effect of reducing symptoms of the aforementioned diseases, cancer and/or fibrotic diseases. It will be understood that the specific dose level, frequency and period of administration to any particular human will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general state of health, gender, diet, time and route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease to which the specific therapy is applied. Using well-known means and methods, the exact dose can be determined by one of skill in the art as a matter of routine experimentation. The prior teaching of the present specification is valid and applicable without restrictions to the pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds of formula (I) if expedient. Pharmaceutical formulations can be administered in the form of dosage units which comprise a predetermined amount of active ingredient per dosage unit. The concentration of the prophylactically or therapeutically active ingredient in the formulation may vary from about 0.1 to 100 wt %. Preferably, the compound of formula (I) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are administered in doses of approximately 0.5 to 1000 mg, more preferably between 1 and 700 mg, most preferably 5 and 100 mg per dose unit. Generally, such a dose range is appropriate for total daily incorporation. In other terms, the daily dose is preferably between approximately 0.02 and 100 mg/kg of body weight. The specific dose for each patient depends, however, on a wide variety of factors as already described in the present specification (e.g. depending on the condition treated, the method of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient). Preferred dosage unit formulations are those which comprise a daily dose or part-dose, as indicated above, or a corresponding fraction thereof of an active ingredient. Furthermore, pharmaceutical formulations of this type can be prepared using a process which is generally known in the pharmaceutical art. Although a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention has to be ultimately determined by the treating doctor or vet by considering a number of factors (e.g. the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition that requires treatment, severity of condition, the nature of the formulation and the method of administration), an effective amount of a compound according to the invention for the treatment of neoplastic growth, for example colon or breast carcinoma, is generally in the range from 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of body weight of the recipient (mammal) per day and particularly typically in the range from 1 to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. Thus, the actual amount per day for an adult mammal weighing 70 kg is usually between 70 and 700 mg, where this amount can be administered as a single dose per day or usually in a series of part-doses (such as, for example, two, three, four, five or six) per day, so that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or solvate or of a physiologically functional derivative thereof can be determined as the fraction of the effective amount of the compound according to the invention per se. It can be assumed that similar doses are suitable for the treatment of other conditions mentioned above. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be employed as medicament in human and veterinary medicine. According to the invention, the compounds of formula (I) and/or physiologically salts thereof are suited for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment and/or monitoring of diseases that are caused, mediated and/or propagated by FSHR activity. It is particularly preferred that the diseases are fertility disorders. It shall be understood that the host of the compound is included in the present scope of protection according to the present invention. Particular preference is given to the stimulation of follicular development, ovulation induction, controlled ovarial hyperstimulation, assisted reproductive technology, including in-vitro fertilization, male hypogonadism and male infertility, including some types of failure of spermatogenesis. The invention also relates to the use of compounds according to formula (I) and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment and/or monitoring of diseases that are caused, mediated and/or propagated by FSHR activity. Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of compounds according to formula (I) and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof for the production of a medicament for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment and/or monitoring of diseases that are caused, mediated and/or propagated by FSHR activity. Compounds of formula (I) and/or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof can furthermore be employed as intermediate for the preparation of further medicament active ingredients. The medicament is preferably prepared in a non-chemical manner, e.g. by combining the active ingredient with at least one solid, fluid and/or semi-fluid carrier or excipient, and optionally in conjunction with a single or more other active substances in an appropriate dosage form. Another object of the present invention are compounds of formula (I) according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof for use in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment and/or monitoring of diseases that are caused, mediated and/or propagated by FSHR activity. Another preferred object of the invention concerns compounds of formula (I) according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof for use in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment and/or monitoring of fertility disorders. The prior teaching of the present specification concerning the compounds of formula (I), including any preferred embodiment thereof, is valid and applicable without restrictions to the compounds according to formula (I) and their salts for use in the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment and/or monitoring of fertility disorders. The compounds of formula (I) according to the invention can be administered before or following an onset of disease once or several times acting as therapy. The aforementioned compounds and medical products of the inventive use are particularly used for the therapeutic treatment. A therapeutically relevant effect relieves to some extent one or more symptoms of a disorder, or returns to normality, either partially or completely, one or more physiological or biochemical parameters associated with or causative of a disease or pathological condition. Monitoring is considered as a kind of treatment provided that the compounds are administered in distinct intervals, e.g. in order to booster the response and eradicate the pathogens and/or symptoms of the disease completely. Either the identical compound or different compounds can be applied. The medicament can also be used to reducing the likelihood of developing a disorder or even prevent the initiation of disorders associated with FSHR activity in advance or to treat the arising and continuing symptoms. The disorders as concerned by the invention are preferably fertility disorders. In the meaning of the invention, prophylactic treatment is advisable if the subject possesses any preconditions for the aforementioned physiological or pathological conditions, such as a familial disposition, a genetic defect, or a previously passed disease. It is another object of the invention to provide a method for treating diseases that are caused, mediated and/or propagated by FSHR activity, wherein at least one compound of formula (I) according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof is administered to a mammal in need of such treatment. It is another preferred object of the invention to provide a method for treating fertility disorders, wherein at least one compound of formula (I) according to the invention and/or physiologically acceptable salts thereof is administered to a mammal in need of such treatment. The compound is preferably provided in an effective amount as defined above. The preferred treatment is an oral administration. In another preferred aspect, the method of treatment aims to achieve ovulation induction and/or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. In still another preferred aspect, the method of treatment forms the basis for a method for in-vitro fertilization comprising the steps of: (a) treating a mammal according to the method of treatment as described above, (b) collecting ova from said mammal, (c) fertilizing said ova, and (d) implanting said fertilized ova into a host mammal. The host mammal can be either the treated mammal (i.e. the patient) or a surrogate. The prior teaching of the invention and its embodiments is valid and applicable without restrictions to the methods of treatment if expedient. In the scope of the present invention, novel benzamide compounds of formula (I) are provided for the first time. The low molecular weight compounds of the invention are strong and selective modulators of the FSH receptor. Their selectivity to the FSH receptor is 10-fold over the LH receptor and even 100-fold over the TSH receptor while the IC50 amounts to more than 10 μM on unrelated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) or non-GPCR targets. The current invention comprises the use of present benzamide derivatives in the regulation and/or modulation of the FSHR signal cascade, which can be advantageously applied as research tool, for diagnosis and/or in treatment of any disorder arising from FSHR signaling. For example, the compounds of the invention are useful in-vitro as unique tools for understanding the biological role of FSH, including the evaluation of the many factors thought to influence, and be influenced by, the production of FSH and the interaction of FSH with the FSHR (e.g. the mechanism of FSH signal transduction/receptor activation). The present compounds are also useful in the development of other compounds that interact with FSHR since the present compounds provide important structure-activity relationship (SAR) information that facilitate that development. Compounds of the present invention that bind to FSHR can be used as reagents for detecting FSHR on living cells, fixed cells, in biological fluids, in tissue homogenates, in purified, natural biological materials, etc. For example, by labeling such compounds, one can identify cells having FSHR on their surfaces. In addition, based on their ability to bind FSHR, compounds of the present invention can be used in in-situ staining, FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting), western blotting, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoadsorptive assay), etc., receptor purification, or in purifying cells expressing FSHR on the cell surface or inside permeabilized cells. The compounds of the invention can also be utilized as commercial research reagents for various medical research and diagnostic uses. Such uses can include but are not limited to: use as a calibration standard for quantifying the activities of candidate FSH agonists in a variety of functional assays; use as blocking reagents in random compound screening, i.e. in looking for new families of FSH receptor ligands, the compounds can be used to block recovery of the presently claimed FSH compounds; use in the co-crystallization with FSHR receptor, i.e. the compounds of the present invention will allow formation of crystals of the compound bound to FSHR, enabling the determination of receptor/compound structure by x-ray crystallography; other research and diagnostic applications, wherein FSHR is preferably activated or such activation is conveniently calibrated against a known quantity of an FSH agonist, etc.; use in assays as probes for determining the expression of FSHR on the surface of cells; and developing assays for detecting compounds which bind to the same site as the FSHR binding ligands. The low molecular weight inhibitors can be applied either themselves and/or in combination with physical measurements for diagnostics of treatment effectiveness. Medicaments and pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds and the use of said compounds to treat FSHR-mediated conditions is a promising, novel approach for a broad spectrum of therapies causing a direct and immediate improvement in the state of health, whether in man and animal. The impact is of special benefit to efficiently combat infertility, either alone or in combination with other fertility-inducing treatments. In particular, the compounds of the invention potentiate the native FSH effect for both ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technology. The orally bioavailable and active new chemical entities of the invention improve convenience for patients and compliance for physicians. The compounds of the invention are active in the primary screen (CHO with or without FSH), selective in secondary screen (no or low activity against TSHR and LHR) and potent in the granulosa cell estrodiol assay. Neither hERG nor any toxic effects could be observed in-vitro. The compounds of formula (I), their salts, isomers, tautomers, enantiomeric forms, diastereomers, racemates, derivatives, prodrugs and/or metabolites are characterized by a high specificity and stability, low manufacturing costs and convenient handling. These features form the basis for a reproducible action, wherein the lack of cross-reactivity is included, and for a reliable and safe interaction with the target structure.

DMF (5.0 mL) was added and filtered. The solid was washed with MeOH (300 mL) and methanol layer was evaporated to give the acid 3-nitro-4-(4-o-tolyl-piperazin-1-yl)-benzoic acid in the first crop (4.0 g, 36%). Step 2 In a mixture of EtOH (100 mL) and MeOH (100 mL) compound acid 3-nitro-4-(4-o-tolyl-piperazin-1-yl)-benzoic acid (2.0 g, 5.86 mmol) was dissolved and evacuated for 5 min. This was added to a 3-necked flask containing Pd/C (0.2 g of 5 wt %) under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was evacuated and nitrogen purged two times and stirred under a balloon of hydrogen for 4 h. LC-MS indicated the completion of reaction and the contents were evacuated and nitrogen purged and filtered through celite, and concentrated to give the aniline 3-amino-4-(4-o-tolyl-piperazin-1-yl)-benzoic acid (1.7 g, 94%). Step 3 In CH2Cl2 (50 mL) aniline 3-amino-4-(4-o-tolyl-piperazin-1-yl)-benzoic acid (1.5 g, 4.8 mmol) was taken with TEA (3.3 mL, 24 mmol) and cooled to 0° C. Furoyl chloride (1.38 g, 10.6 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5.0 mL) was added dropwise and the reaction was stirred at 0-25° C. for 6 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and dissolved in a mixture of MeOH (20 mL) and THF (20 mL) and stirred with a solution of 2N NaOH (20 mL) for 2 h. The solvents were removed and the contents were dissolved in water and the solution was brought to pH 5.0 using 2 N HCl. The solid product 3-[(Furan-2-carbonyl)-amino]-4-(4-o-tolyl-piperazin-1-yl)-benzoic acid was filtered and dried (1.1 g, 56%).
