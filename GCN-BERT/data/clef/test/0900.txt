FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to self-crosslinking silicone pressure sensitive adhesive coating compositions. More particularly, the present invention relates to addition curable silicone compositions that have controllable crosslinking, thus stable post-cure properties. The present invention also relates to processes of making the compositions, and to articles containing a substrate having the compositions adhered thereto. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA), as defined by the Pressure-Sensitive Tape Council, are materials having aggressive and permanent tack, adhering with minimal contact pressure, requiring no activation by any energy source, having sufficient shear resistance under a load and sufficient cohesive strength to be cleanly removed from adherents. There are several classes of pressure sensitive adhesives, silicones being one of them. Typically silicone PSAs cure either by peroxide radicals or through an addition reaction between a vinyl containing siloxane oligomer/polymer and a hydride containing siloxane oligomer. Peroxide curing tends to produce by-products that may affect the optical clarity of the adhesives. Accordingly, peroxide curable PSAs are not suitable for use in construction of electronic displays, such as cell phones, GPS navigation, and television displays, where optical clarity is essential. Compared with peroxide curable PSAs, addition curable silicone PSAs do not normally contain by-products that affect optical clarity of the adhesives, thus being suitable for use in construction of multi-layer laminate electronic displays. Addition curable silicone PSAs are known in the art and have been described for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,983,298; 4,774,297; 4,988,779; 5,169,727; 5,248,739; 6,466,532; 5,576,110; and JP 8209104. However, these prior art addition curable PSAs relied on multi-component blends to achieve required adhesive properties of tack, peel adhesion, and cohesive strength. As such, the requisite crosslinking has been unpredictable and the adhesive properties of the PSAs upon cure have been unstable. Attempts have been made to solve the problems associated with the prior art addition curable silicone PSAs. Illustratively, US 20050113513 to Griswold discloses an addition curable silicone PSA composition that contains a self-crosslinkable component and a hydrosilation catalyst. According to Griswold, the self-crosslinkable component can be made by (1) condensing an aromatic soluble silicone resin or resinous copolymer with an alkenyl containing polydiorganosiloxane, and (2) reacting the condensation reaction product with a silylating agent to cap the silanol groups remaining from the condensation reaction to form silicon-bonded hydrogen groups using as an example 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisilazane. However, one drawback of the process is that after the condensation reaction, not all remaining silanol groups are accessible to silylation because of steric hindrance. Further, as shown in examples 4 and 5 of the '513 publication, after the addition reaction, the silicon-hydride concentrations were high due to the hydride group being sterically hindered for the hydrosilation reaction with the vinyl groups on the polymer/oligomer. This limitation prevents an effective means for controlling crosslink density and therefore cohesive strength for a pressure sensitive adhesive. Furthermore, the residual silicon-hydride groups affect the stability of pressure adhesive properties such as peel adhesion and tack upon storage. In addition, residual hydride after hydrosilation cure can result in out gassing in a laminate construction being observed as bubbles. Several other attempts to resolve the defects in the prior art were also unsuccessful. Accordingly, there is a continuing need in the industry for addition curable silicone pressure sensitive adhesive compositions that have controllable crosslinking and stable post-cure adhesive properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the present invention relates to a silicone pressure sensitive adhesive composition, which has stable adhesive properties upon cure. The composition comprises (A) a reaction product of a mixture comprising (i) a resin comprising R13SiO1/2 ("M") units and SiO4/2 ("Q") units wherein each R1 is independently a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; wherein the copolymer comprises from 70 mol% to 99 mol% of hydroxyl radicals and from 1 mol% to 30 mol% of hydride radicals, based on the total moles of the hydroxyl and the hydride radicals of the resin; wherein the hydroxyl radicals are bonded directly to the silicon atoms of the Q units; and the hydride radicals are bonded to the silicon atoms of the Q units via -OSiHR52 radicals, wherein R5 is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and(ii) one or more vinyl-functional polyorganosiloxanes; and(B) a hydrosilation catalyst. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for preparing the silicone pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention. The process includes the steps of: (i) reacting a MQ resin with a capping agent being R6a SiX4-a/2 to provide a partially end-capped MQ resin, wherein the MQ resin consists essentially of R13SiO1/2 ("M") units and SiO4/2 ("Q") units, each R1 is independently a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, the MQ resin comprises from 1% to 4% by weight, based on the total weight of the MQ resin, of hydroxyl radicals bonded to the silicon atoms of the Q units, and the MQ resin does not contain hydride radicals; wherein each R6 is independently hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms with the proviso that at least one R6 is hydrogen, X is N, Cl, or O, and a is from 0.5 to 2.0; wherein the partially end-capped MQ resin contains from 70 mol% to 99 mol% of hydroxyl radicals and from 1 mol% to 30 mol% of hydride radicals based on the total moles of the hydroxyl and the hydride radicals of the partially end-capped MQ resin; wherein the hydroxyl radicals are bonded directly to the silicon atoms of the Q units, and the hydride radicals are bonded to the silicon atoms of the Q units via -OSiHR52 radicals, wherein R5 is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;(ii) reacting the partially-end capped MQ resin from step (i) with one or more vinyl-functional polyorganosiloxanes in the presence of an organic amine catalyst to provide an intermediate product; and(iii) contacting the intermediate product from step (ii) with a hydrosilation catalyst thus preparing the silicone pressure sensitive adhesive composition of the present invention.

The organic amine catalyst which promotes the reaction between resin (A)(i) and vinyl-containing polyorganosiloxane (A)(ii) is not particularly limited. It can be a by-product of a capping agent or a silane coupling agent. For example, dimethyldiisopropylaminosilane gives isopropylamine as a by-product, which can be used as the amine catalyst.

The exact necessary amount of said catalyst component will depend upon the particular catalyst, the composition and the amount of component (A). The said amount can be as low as one part by weight of platinum for every one million parts by weight of component (A). In one embodiment, the amount of platinum-containing catalyst component to be used is sufficient to provide from 5 to 500 parts by weight platinum per one million parts by weight of component (A).
