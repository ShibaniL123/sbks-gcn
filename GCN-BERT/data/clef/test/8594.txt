6-(Chloroacetyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (1.00 g, 4.47 mmol) and thiourea (0.36 g, 4.69 mmol) were suspended in anhydrous ethanol (10 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120° C. for 30 min. The mixture was diluted with tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) and neutralized with 1N aq. NaOH solution and then extracted with ethyl acetate (2×200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.920 g, 73%) as a light brown solid.
