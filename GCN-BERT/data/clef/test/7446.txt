Step 2. 5-(2-Fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine
5-Bromo-1-{[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl}-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (1.36 g, 4.16 mmol), (2-fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)boronic acid (0.85 g, 5.0 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (Pd XPhos G2) (400 mg, 0.5 mmol), potassium phosphate (3.6 g, 17 mmol) and a magnet bar were placed in a flask. The flask was sealed with a rubber cap, evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen (this process was repeated a total of three times). After dioxane (20 mL) and degassed water (2 mL) were added, the mixture was heated at 90° C. for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl acetate, washed with brine and the separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were removed in vacuo and obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (0.7 g, 45%).
