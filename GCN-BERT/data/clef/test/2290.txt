FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of luminescent material, particularly to a sulfur oxide luminescent material and preparation method therefor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In recent years, field emission devices have attracted much attention due to the advantages, such as low operating voltage, low power consumption, no deflection coil, no X-ray radiation, radiation resistance and magnetic interference resistance, etc. By exciting the luminescent material using field emission cathode ray, field emission light source of high luminance and good color rendering properties can be obtained, which can be applied to professional lighting, display, instructions, general lighting and other fields. Similar to the working principle of conventional cathode-ray tube (CRT), such field emission display lights and forms images by electron beam bombarding on red, green blue trichromatic fluorescent powders. Field emission display has potential advantages in luminance, visual angle, response time, working temperature range, power consumption and other aspects. Sulfur oxides have becoming important hosts for luminescent material activated by rare earth elements, due to good chemical stability, poorly soluble in water, high melting point, strong resistance to oxidation, high light-absorption efficiency and non-toxic. A sulfur oxide doped with europium Ln2O2S:Eu3+ is an important red luminescent material having excellent properties and widely used. However, low luminescent efficiency of the traditional sulfur oxide luminescent material limits its further application. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of this, it is necessary to provide a sulfur oxide luminescent material having relatively high luminescent efficiency. A sulfur oxide luminescent material having a general chemical formula of Ln2-xO2S:Eux3+@My, where Eu3+ is doped in Ln2-xO2S; Ln2-xO2S:Eux3+ has a porous structure, and @ is coating; Ln is selected from Y, Gd and La; M is at least one of Ag, Au, Pt, Pd and Cu nanoparticles; x is in a range of 0<x≤0.2; y is a molar ratio of M to Ln2-xO2S:Eux3+ and y is in a range of 0<y≤1×10-2. In one embodiment, x is in a range of 0.001<x≤0.1. In another embodiment, y is in a range of 1 × 10-5≤y≤1 ×10-3. By coating a metal nanoparticle M, the sulfur oxide luminescent material forms a core-shell structure, where M is an inner core and porous material of Ln2-xO2S:Eux3+ is an outer shell. The structure improves internal quantum efficiency of the sulfur oxide luminescent material. Meanwhile, the luminescent efficiency of the material is greatly increased under same excitation conditions due to plasma effect of metal, and the wavelength of emitting light remains unchanged. There is enough space between the inner core and the outer shell so reducing the amount of rare earth element of the outer shell and reducing the costs. In addition, it is necessary to provide a method for preparing a sulfur oxide luminescent material having relatively high luminescent efficiency.
