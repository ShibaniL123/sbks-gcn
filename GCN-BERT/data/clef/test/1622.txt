No. 14/453,209, filed Aug. 6, 2014, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/864,156, filed Aug. 9, 2013, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/915,257 filed Dec. 12, 2013, the entireties of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to the field of infant and child accessories, and more particularly to a mobile device for supporting and moving an infant or child, which is optimized for access to and interaction with the infant or child by a parent or caregiver. BACKGROUND Various accessories are used for supporting and transporting infants and children for different purposes. For example, a high-chair may be used for feeding or seating a child who can sit up, a bassinet or carrier may be used to support a laying or reclining infant or child, and a stroller may be used to transport a child from one location to another. None of these known accessories, however, allows optimal access to and interaction with an infant or child supported therein. For example, a high-chair may not be well suited for a child who has not yet grown strong enough to sit up. High chairs also typically provide a seating height that is too high for interaction with the child by a caregiver seated on a sofa or other adult furniture. The mobility and maneuverability of high-chairs is typically limited at best. And the feeding tray, support frame and/or other components of a high-chair may interfere with positioning the infant or child in close proximity to a caregiver seated on a sofa or other adult furniture, and limit access to and interaction with the infant by the caregiver. Conversely, the support height of known bassinets and carriers is commonly too low for ease of interaction with and access to the child by a caregiver seated on a sofa or other adult furniture, or when seated at a table for dining. The mobility and maneuverability of bassinets and carriers is also typically limited at best. And the support frame, carrier handles, and/or other components of a bassinet or carrier may interfere with positioning the infant or child in close proximity to a caregiver seated on a sofa or other adult furniture, and limit access to and interaction with the infant by the caregiver. Strollers also typically position an infant or child too low for ease of interaction with and access to the child by a caregiver seated on a sofa or other adult furniture, or when seated at a table for dining. The mobility and maneuverability of strollers is typically best for outside use or use in open interior areas, but may not be good for moving an infant or child inside a home or other interior space where closely spaced furniture and narrow doorways and halls can interfere with movement and turning of a stroller. Stroller handles and support frames, large wheel assemblies, feeding trays and other components of a stroller may also interfere with positioning the infant or child in close proximity to a caregiver seated on a sofa or other adult furniture, and limit access to and interaction with the infant by a caregiver. Accordingly, it has been discovered that needs exist for a mobile device for supporting and moving an infant or child, which is optimized for access to and interaction with the infant or child by a parent or caregiver, particularly for example, inside a home or other interior space. It is to the provision of a mobile device for supporting and moving an infant or child meeting these and other needs that the present invention is primarily directed.

With reference now to the drawing figures, wherein like reference numbers represent corresponding parts throughout the several views, FIGS. 1-3 show a mobile device 10 for supporting and moving an infant or child, according to an example embodiment of the invention. The device 10 generally comprises a support frame 20 and a seat or resting portion 40 supported on the support frame. The seat or resting portion 40 can be coupled directly to the support frame 20, or can be indirectly coupled to the frame by one or more intermediate couplings, linkages or connection members. Optionally, at least some degree of freedom of movement is provided between the seat or resting portion 40 and the support frame 20, for example allowing a rocking, jiggle, bounce, swing or other range of motion of the seat or resting portion relative to the support frame and underlying support surface. In example forms, the mobile support device is configured for use with zero to six month old infants, where access by, proximity to and interaction with a parent or other adult caregiver is most frequently needed, but in alternate forms may be adapted to other uses. The support frame 20 preferably comprises one or more (four in the depicted embodiment) support legs or columns 22 for providing structural support to hold the seat or resting portion 40 at an elevation above the floor or other support surface. One or more cross-members or braces 24 extend between the legs 22 and/or between other braces. Wheels or rollers 26 mounted to distal or lower ends of the legs 22 allow for ease of mobility of the mobile support device 10 along the floor or other support surface. Optionally the wheels 26 comprise caster wheels or otherwise pivot or turn to provide ease of maneuverability. In example forms, the diameter of the wheels 26 is between about 2.5″-5″, more preferably between about 3″-4″, for example about 3.5″. The frame 20 is optionally foldable or collapsible for compact storage and transport, for example by means of one or more hinged connections, pins, snap buttons, or other connection or coupling means. A storage tray 28 or other container or compartment for holding toys or other items is optionally mounted to a cross-member 24 or otherwise attached to the frame 20. In example embodiments, the distal or lower ends of the legs 22 of the support frame 20 define an outline or periphery P along the floor or other support surface, as shown in broken lines in FIG. 2, within the upward projection of which the mobile support device 10 is substantially or entirely contained. In the depicted embodiment, the periphery P is generally rectangular or square in profile, being defined about four legs 22, but in alternate embodiments may be for example triangular, polygonal or circular in profile depending on the number and configuration of the legs of the support frame. In example embodiments, the periphery P is between about 14″-23″ wide, preferably between about 16″-20″ wide, and for example about 18″ wide in width (W), by between about 19″-31″, preferably between about 22″-28″, and for example about 25″ long in length (L), for example about 18″×25″, defining a length-to-width aspect ratio (L/W) of between about 0.8-2.2, preferably between about 1.1-1.8, and for example about 1.4. Optionally, the legs 22 are generally arcuate, such that their lower or distal portions are more vertically oriented and their upper or proximal portions curve to a more horizontal or oblique angle, with the curvature being convex or outwardly directed. The cross-braces 24 are optionally inset from an upward projection of the periphery P, for example by providing them with an inward or concave curvature and/or by attachment inwardly of the support legs 22, as seen best with reference to FIG. 3. In this manner, the mobile support device 10 can be positioned in close proximity to a caregiver seated on furniture, without the support frame 20 interfering with movement and positioning of the device. In example embodiments, the seat or resting portion 40 comprises a fabric or soft-goods sling 42, forming a reclined seat or bassinet for comfortably receiving an infant or child, mounted to a seat frame 44. The sling 42 optionally comprises structural bracing and/or padding for improved comfort and positioning. One or more straps or harness connections are optionally provided to secure the child in the sling 42. The sling 42 and/or the seat frame 44 are optionally repositionable to allow adjustment of the inclination, elevation or other positioning of the seat or resting portion 40, for example by means of a cinch cord or strap, snap couplings, pivotal connection, or other positional adjustment means. In example embodiments, the seat or resting portion 40 is positioned or positionable at an angle of inclination of between about 15°-40° from horizontal, for example about 27.5° relative to the horizontal. The mobile support device 10 preferably further comprises a multi-point accessible handle 60 having a plurality of gripping or contact surfaces positioned at different points about the seat or resting portion 40. In example embodiments, the handle 60 provides access for gripping adjacent at least two of the head end, foot end, left side and/or right side of the seat or resting portion 40, and more preferably from three or all four sides thereof. In the depicted embodiment, the handle 60 comprises oval or elliptically shaped wrap-around or perimeter handle or gripping halo extending about all or a substantial portion of the seat or resting portion 40. In this manner, the handle can be gripped to push or pull the device 10 from any position for improved mobility and maneuverability. Provision of a wrap-around handle or halo as in the depicted embodiment allows the handle to serve the additional function of a protective bumper about the seat or resting portion 40 of the mobile support device 10. The handle 60 is preferably positioned adjacent or in close proximity below the upper rim of the seat or resting portion 40 formed by the seat frame 44, and closely or generally conforms to the peripheral profile of the seat frame. In example embodiments, the wrap-around handle 60 defines an upper support frame portion that generally aligns with the upward projection of the periphery P of the lower support frame 20. In alternate embodiments, the wrap-around handle 60 may be offset from the projection of periphery P of the lower support frame 20; either inwardly offset relative to the lower support frame for improved stability, or outwardly offset for improved access and proximity to the infant by an adult caregiver when the lower support frame is positioned against a sofa or other furniture. In example embodiments, the handle 60 is coupled to the support frame 20, and the seat frame 44 is suspended from or otherwise coupled to the handle. A hinge connection, one or more springs, or other articulation means operably connected between the seat frame 44 and the handle 60 or the support frame 20 optionally allows movement of the seat or resting portion 40 relative to the support frame, for soothing or engaging an infant or child positioned in the mobile support device 10. In example embodiments, the seat 40 may jiggle, rock, swing, bounce or otherwise move. A motorized or manually energized movement mechanism is optionally provided. A pivotal coupling is optionally provided between the support frame 20 and the handle 60 to allow adjustment of the inclination of the seat 40. An upper member 80, such as a canopy, toy bar or handle is optionally attached over the seat 40, for example by pivotal or fixed attachment to a multi-connection hub or mounting member 82 coupling with the support frame 20 and/or the handle 60. Optionally, a vibration unit can be coupled to the support frame 20 or seat frame 44 for soothing the infant or child positioned in the mobile support device 10. In example embodiments, the mobile support device is configured to position the infant or child at an elevation or height and/or at an orientation that is optimized for access, proximity and interaction with an adult caregiver in various situations, for example while the caregiver is standing, walking, seated at a table for dining, or seated in a sofa, easy chair or other adult furniture. For example, the nominal or median height (H) of the seat or resting portion 40 may be positioned at about 21″-36″ above the floor, and more preferably at a height of about 26″-32″, for example about 29″ high; thereby, for example, defining a height-to-width (H/W) aspect ratio of between about 0.9-2.6, preferably between about 1.3-2.0, and for example about 1.6; and a length-to-width (L/W) aspect ratio of between about 0.8-2.2, preferably between about 1.1-1.8, and for example about 1.4. Optionally, the height of the seat or resting portion 40 may be adjustable. In example embodiments, the wrap-around handle 60 may be inclined at an oblique angle of for example about 15°-40°, for example about 27.5° relative to the horizontal or have a staggered profile along its length, whereby a lower portion at the foot end of the seat 40 is positioned lower than the nominal or median height (H) of the seat, thus providing a convenient gripping position for the caregiver when seated; and an upper portion at the head end of the seat is positioned higher than the nominal or median height, thus providing a convenient gripping position for the caregiver when standing or walking. In example embodiments, the elevation of the handle at the foot end is between about 13″-22″ high, preferably between about 16″-19″ in height, and for example about 17.5″ above the floor; and the elevation of the handle at the head end is between about 22″-38″ high, preferably between about 27″-33″ in height, and for example about 30″ above the floor. In this manner the height of the seat or resting portion allows a line-of-sight eye-contact interaction between an infant on the seat or resting portion and an adult seated at a standard dining table, and also allows close proximity between the infant on the seat or resting portion and an adult seated on a standard sofa. For example, the mobile support device may be positioned adjacent a standard sofa with the infant being within 12″-36″, and preferably within 24″ or less, from the adult; and/or the line of sight between the infant's eye-level and the adult's eye level is between about 0°-30°, preferably 15° or less, relative to horizontal, when the infant is positioned about 48″-60″ from the adult at a dining table. FIGS. 4A-4C show one alternate embodiment of a mobile support device 110, FIG. 4D shows another alternate embodiment of a mobile support device 210, and FIGS. 4E and 4F show still another alternate embodiment of a mobile support device 310, according to various forms of the invention. In its various forms, the child support device comprises a frame configured to rest on a support surface and a seat coupled to the frame and adapted for receiving an infant. Preferably, the support device includes one or more wheel assemblies, or other rolling/sliding means, which allow the support device to be rolled across the support surface. Example embodiments of the wheel assemblies can include a locking mechanism to selectively prohibit rolling of the child support device. The wheel assemblies can also or alternatively include a braking mechanism that engages in the event of accidental rolling. For example, one or more of the wheel assemblies 126 of the movable support device 110 can comprise a brake 127 for selectively engaging to prevent rotation of the wheel to resist movement of the device, or disengaging to release the wheel and allow movement of the device. A handle can also be included to facilitate a caregiver pushing or pulling the support device from room to room. Example embodiments of the handle are movable between various positions, such as above, behind, or in front of the seat. The seat can be coupled to the frame by way of one or more resilient members, such as springs or compliant wires that allow the seat to bounce or jiggle with respect to the frame. This bouncing motion can be soothing to children, and the resilient suspension can soften the jarring effect of any bumps as the support device is wheeled from place to place. Example embodiments of the seat can also be selectively reclined with respect to the support surface, either via adjustable soft-goods or by a mechanical recline adjustment mechanism. Moreover, various accessories can be attached to the child support device, such as a vibration unit, a tray, and/or a storage bin. The support device can further be configured to collapse for easy storage and transport. In further alternate embodiments, the seat or resting portion is optionally detachable and removable from a coupling or receiver of the lower support frame. In this manner, the lower support frame can provide a docking station for one or more interchangeable seat, carrier, support, changing table or other accessories that can be selectively attached to and removed from the coupling of the lower support frame. For improved mobility of the device and accessibility to the infant or child, example embodiments of the mobile support device according to the present invention do not include any feeding tray, push-handle or other components as are commonly included on high-chairs or strollers, or at least do not include such components in a position or configuration extending substantially beyond the upward projection of the periphery of the device's support frame where they could interfere with mobility, maneuverability, access, proximity or interaction with the infant. Optionally, as depicted in FIG. 4D, a tray 230 may project outwardly from the upper portion of the support frame 220 at least partially beyond the upward projection of the periphery of the support frame, but is preferably positioned so as not to interfere with mobility, maneuverability, access, proximity or interaction with the infant.
