Example 7: synthesis of bis(4-bromophenyl)diphenylsilane
A stir bar was placed in a 250 mL dry double neck bottle and followed by flushed and purged by nitrogen three times to be used later. A separatory funnel was installed. 1,4-dibromobenzene (11.7 mg, 50 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous ether (100 mL) dried by sodium under an argon system and followed by cooling the temperature of the system to 0° C. To the solution was slowly added n-BuLi (1.6 M, 36 mL, 55 mmol) via the separatory funnel and react for 2 hours under the system temperature at 0° C. Ether (50 mL) and dichlorodiphenylsilane (5.27 mL, 25 mmol) were slowly added in the double neck bottle via the separatory funnel, and the solution is bright yellow at this time. Then, the solution was reacted 24 hours at room temperature to become white cloudy. After quenched with water, ether was removed in a rotary evaporator. Again, quenched with dichloromethane, and the organic layer was dried and condensed. Followed by recrystallized from dichloromethane/methylene, compound 7 (bis(4-bromophenyl)diphenylsilane, 9.08 g, yield: 73%) as a white solid was obtained. Spectral data as follow:
