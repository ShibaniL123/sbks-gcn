FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to 2-(substituted sulphur, sulphone or sulphoxide)-3-(substituted phenyl)propionic acid derivatives, 2-(substituted oxygen)-3-(substituted phenyl)propionic acid derivatives, benzoic acid derivatives, and derivatives of 2-methyl-2-(phenoxy or phenylthio)propanoic acid and 2-(methyl or ethyl)-2-(phenoxy or phenylthio)butanoic acid, to processes for preparing such compounds, to their use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) includes conditions where the patients suffer from inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI)-tract. Several of those are considered to be of chronic nature, e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and the medical need is large. The patients suffer from fevers, pain, diarrhea or constipation and in addition hemorrhagic stool. Treatment is constrained to symptom relief, inflammatory suppression and in severe cases surgery and which all current treatment are linked to relatively severe side effects. Anti-inflammatory treatments with oral gluco-corticoid receptor (GCR) agonists (e.g. Budesonide, Prednisolone or Fluticazone) can cause diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, skin defects. In addition GCR agonist treatment suppresses life saving immuno-activation upon infection by virus, bacteria or other pathogenic microbes, which further reduces patient quality of life and increases risk for secondary disease. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) and antibiotics (e.g. 5-ASA, Sulfasalazine, and Metronidazole) are also commonly used, however with limited effect. Similar reasoning as above is also relevant for other inflammatory diseases such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Thus, there is a great need for more effective anti-inflammatory treatments with less or preferably no side effects. The nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) comprise a series of soluble protein complexes that upon ligand modulation and co-factor complexation translocate to the cellular nucleus with subsequent binding to specific DNA regions. Such binding induces or reduces protein expression cascades and, for several NHRs, immunoactivation or deactivation has been implicated. For example, Oestrogen receptors (Steffan et al, 2006), the Liver X Receptor (LXR) (Tontonoz et al, US2004/0259948; Zelcer & Tontonoz, 2006) and the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR)-α, γ and/or δ, (Desreumaux et al, 2001; Tanaka et al, 2001; Lewis et al, 2001; Patel et al; 2003) have all been suggested to exert such immuno-modulatory effects via small molecular modulators. NHRs are in general multi-potent in the sense that they regulate several profound physiological events, either simultaneously or sequentially, depending on the cell type or tissue in which the modulation is accomplished. This might also be the reason for unwanted effects from these NHR modulators, which are in parallel with the mechanism related side effects observed with the GCR modulators. The regulation of inflammatory responses by PPARs have been suggested to involve the trans-repression of inflammatory gene activation by interfering with several signalling pathways of the transcription factors NFkB, STAT-1, NFAT and AP-1. As a result of this interaction, a number of down-streams pathways are affected. These includes the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, TNF) or chemokines (e.g., MCP-1, IL-8), decrease expression of adhesion molecules (e.g., V-CAM) resulting in reduced leukocyte recruitment. Other anti-inflammatory effects include the decreased expression of oxidative stress markers (e.g., iNOS, COX-2), the repressed expression of extra cellular matrix components (e.g., MMPs, TGF-β), as well as induced apoptosis in a variety of cell types (Belvisi M et al., 2006; Duboquoy L et al., 2006; Cunard R 2005). In addition to its anti-inflammatory action, PPARs have also been suggested to have anti-proliferative properties, possibly as a result of induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (Galli A et al., 2006). Compounds delivered orally initially expose the GI-tract and an inhaled compound the respiratory organs when administered to patients. Given the above reasoning it would be advantageous, for a patient with GI inflammation, for a compound to have properties such that it exposes the GI tract but is designed to be eliminated or metabolized before it reaches cells, tissues or body compartments where it can induce unwanted effects. A method to accomplish this has been introduced by Bodor and co-workers (Bodor et al, 1995; Bodor & Buchwald, 2006; Bodo & Bodor, WO 9200988), who named it “soft-drugs”, meaning a drug that exerts its pharmacological or medicinal effects during a controlled time frame in a controlled compartment, and thereafter is “soft” in the sense that it is predestined to elimination by metabolism in a predicted way. The definition of the term “soft drug” varies. In this patent application, the definition of the term “soft drug” is a chemical compound that exerts its activity in the target organ, and subsequent inactivation or alteration by metabolism is such that receptor modulation within other compartments (e.g. systemic compartments) is excluded and unwanted effects and/or side effects that are disadvantageous, or of no use, for the patient is reduced. US 2003/0236227 discusses the use of soft drugs for the treatment of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis. However, these soft drugs have activity in the systemic compartment, and thus they do not fall within the definition of the term “soft drugs” in this patent application. Further, US 2003/0236227 is silent about compounds having anti-inflammatory properties. As discussed above, there remains a need for compounds having anti-inflammatory properties. In particular, there is a need for compounds with anti-inflammatory effect and having the property of being locally active in the target organ with little or no effect in other compartments (e.g. systemic compartments). Accordingly, we hereby provide compounds with anti-inflammatory properties which are believed to act according to the definition of the term “soft drug” in the present patent application. The term “PPAR modulator” as used herein, refers to the ability of a compound to modulate the biological activity of PPARα and/or PPARγ and/or PPARδ via increase or decrease of the function and/or expression of PPARα and/or PPARγ and/or PPARδ, where PPARα and/or PPARγ and/or PPARδ function may include transcription regulatory activity and/or protein-binding. Modulation may occur in vitro or in vivo. Modulation, as described herein, includes antagonism, agonism, partial antagonism and/or partial agonism of a function or characteristic associated with PPARα and/or PPARγ and/or PPARδ, either directly or indirectly, and/or the upregulation or downregulation of PPARα and/or PPARγ and/or PPARδ expression, either directly or indirectly. More specifically, such a PPAR modulator either enhances or inhibits the biological activities of PPAR via the function and/or expression of PPAR. If such a modulator partially or completely enhances the biological activities of PPAR via the function and/or expression of PPAR, it is a partial or full PPAR agonist, respectively. It is the object of the present invention to provide PPAR modulators. Another object of this invention is to provide PPAR modulator compounds being PPAR agonists. To aid understanding the terms “local” and “systemic” compartments, for oral administration the local compartment is the GI tract (i.e. gastrointestinal tract); when a compound has passed beyond/through the liver it has reached the systemic compartment. For inhaled compounds the lung is the local compartment, and beyond the lung is the systemic compartment. By systemic compartment we mean any tissue or organ that an administrated compound reaches after it has passed beyond/through another tissue or organ in which some (e.g. 90%, but also including 100%) elimination or metabolism of the compound as occurred. An aim with PPAR soft drugs for IBD should be to not accept predicted human systemic exposure higher than a factor (e.g. 10) below a corresponding exposure that would give an expected pharmacological effect in dyslipidemic patients. It should be noted that to show activity in the specific Test Methods described herein, the PPAR modulator compound must bind to the ligand binding domain of the PPAR and recruit one or more of the nuclear hormone receptor co-factors present in the U-2 OS cell-based method described herein. The compounds of this invention that form an PPAR-modulator compound-complex may recruit at least one or more of the other >80 known different nuclear hormone receptor cofactors in any other cell-based method, prepared and assayed according to known procedures. Compounds according to Formula I, XI, CI and MI, that do not recruit any of the co-factors present in the in cell-based method described herein, are however anticipated to bind to PPAR and the PPAR-modulator compound-complex so formed will recruit at least one or more of the other >80 known different nuclear receptor co-factors present in other cellular systems. The PPAR modulator compound-complex may also displace co-repressors, with simultaneous recruitment of a co-activator or alternatively displace a co-repressor without co-activator recruitment, leading to partial activation of certain PPAR regulated genes. Peptides derived from any of these other nuclear hormone receptor co-factors may be similarly prepared and assayed according to known procedures.

General Experimental Procedures Regarding Examples 28-44 Phase Separator from IST was used. Flash chromatography was performed using standard glass columns employing normal phase silica gel 60 (0.040-0.063 mm, Merck). HPLC purifications were performed on Waters FractionLynx HPLC system with a mass triggered fraction collector, a Sunfire C18 5 μm 19 mm×150 mm column using MeCN/HCO2H buffer system with a gradient from 100% mobilphase A (5% MeCN+95% 0.1 M HCO2H, pH3) to 100% mobilphase B (100% MeCN). 1H NMR measurements were performed on a Varian Inova 400 and 600 spectrometer, operating at 1H frequencies of 400 and 600 MHz. Chemical shifts are given in δ values (ppm) with the solvent used as internal standard. Explanation for plate-NMR: The solutions are taken from a concentrated sample dissolved in (CH3)2SO and are diluted with (CD3)250. Since a substantial amount of (CH3)2SO is present in the sample, first a pre-scan is run and analysed to automatically suppress the (CH3)2SO (2.54 ppm) and H2O (3.3 ppm) peaks. This means that in this so-called wetID experiment the intensity of peaks that reside in these areas around 3.3 ppm and 2.54 ppm are reduced. Furthermore impurities are seen in the spectrum which give rise to a triplet at 1.12 ppm, a singlet at 2.96 ppm and two multiplets between 2.76-2.70 ppm and 2.61-2.55 ppm. Mass spectral data were obtained using a Micromass LCT or Waters Q-Tof micro system and, where appropriate, either positive ion data or negative ion data were collected.

Biological Activity Transactivation Assay Expression vectors were prepared by inserting the ligand binding domain cDNA (complementary DNA) of human PPARalpha (amino acid 168-468) and human PPARgamma (amino acid 205-505), 3′ to and in frame with, the yeast GAL4 transcription factor DNA binding domain and the nuclear localization signal from the T-antigen of Polyoma Virus into the mammalian expression vector pSGS (Stratagene). The resulting expression vectors pSGGAL-PPARalpha and pSGGAL-PPARgamma were used in co-transfection experiments together with a modified pGL3 promoter plasmid (Promega) containing five copies of the UAS GAL4 recognition site. 2.5 μg pSGGAL-PPARalpha or pSGGAL-PPARgamma were mixed with 25 μg pGL3p 1×UAS and 22.5 μg pBluescript (Stratagene) in 0.95 mL ice cold PBS containing between 9-12 million U-2 OS (human osteosarcoma) cells. The cell/DNA mixture was incubated on ice for 5 minutes and then divided between two 0.4 cm cuvettes and electroporated at 960 μF, 230 V using a BioRad electroporator. The two electroporation mixes were combined in assay medium [Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium w/o phenol red, (Gibco 11880-028) including 10% FBS (Foetal Bovine Serum), 1% PEST (Penicillin & Streptomycin), 20 mM Hepes, 2 mM L-Glutamine and 0.36% Glucose (Gibco 31966-021)] at 0.32 million cells/ml. 25 μl diluted, electroporated cells, were seeded into 384-well plates and allowed to adhere for 3-4 h at 37° C., 5% CO2 in a cell culture incubator. Test compounds in DMSO were diluted 40 fold in assay medium. 7 μl of diluted compound was added to the adhered electroporated cells and incubation was continued for 40 h in a cell culture incubator. Cells were lysed by adding 32 μl/well LucLite (Packard) and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Luciferase activity was measured using a luminometry protocol on a Wallac Victor2 plate reader. 16 μM ETYA was used as the 100% control for humanPPARalpha activity and 16 μM Pioglitazone was used as the 100% control for humanPPARgamma activity. In Vivo Assay Determination of Plasma Clearance and Oral Bioavailability in Hamster or Mouse Plasma clearance and oral bioavailability is estimated in Syrian male hamster or in female C57Bl/6 mice. Hamsters are prepared 2 days prior to dosing by cannulation of the left carotid artery for blood sampling and, when applicable, by cannulation of the right jugular vein for intravenous administration. The cannulae are filled with heparin (100 IU/ml), extorized at the nape of the neck and sealed. The surgery is performed under isoflurane (Forene®, Abbott) anaesthesia. After surgery and under the experiment, the hamsters are housed individually and have free access to food and water. Also mice have free access to food and water prior and during the experiment. Intravenous administration occurs in the tail vein. At pre-defined timepoints the mouse is anaesthetized with isoflurane and blood is taken from a vein. The compound is dissolved in TEG:DMA:water (1:1:1) or another appropriate vehicle. For determination of plasma clearance the compound is administered as an intravenous (iv) bolus injection at a dose of ˜2 μmol/kg. Blood samples are collected at frequent intervals up to at least 6 hours after drug administration. For bioavailability estimates the compound is administered orally at ˜8 μmol/kg via gavage and blood samples are collected frequently up to at least 6 hours after dosing. Blood samples are collected in heparinized tubes, kept on ice and centrifuged within 30 min for 5 min at 10000 g and 4° C. An aliquot of 50 μl plasma is transferred to 96-well plate and stored at −20° C. For analysis, samples are precipitated with 150 μl cold acetonitrile and centrifuged for 20 min at 2900 g. The supernatant is diluted 1:1 with water and analysed by LCMSMS. The concentrations of the soft drug and, if possible, at least of one of the expected metabolites, are determined using standard curves. The concentrations of the compound in the formulation are confirmed by LCMSMS. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve following oral and intravenous administration, AUC(0-t), is calculated using a combination of the linear and logarithmic trapezoidal rule from the time of administration to the sampling time with the last determinable plasma concentration. For the intravenous bolus dose, the concentration at time zero, C(0), is estimated by log linear regression of the first two concentration-time points. The AUC(0-t) is extrapolated to AUC by adding Ct/k. Ct is the predicted plasma concentration at the time of the last plasma sample with a determinable concentration, and k is the apparent terminal rate constant. Ct and k were obtained by linear least squares regression analysis of the logarithm of the last 3 to 5 plasma concentrations versus time. The apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) is calculated as ln 2/k. The bioavailability (F) is calculated as [in-line-formulae](AUCp.o.×Dosei.v., mean/AUCi.v., mean×Dosep.o.)×100%.[/in-line-formulae] Estimates of total plasma clearance and of volumes of distribution are calculated from plasma concentration data obtained after intravenous administration of the test item. The total plasma clearance, CL, is calculated as Dosei.v./AUCi.v., and the apparent volume of distribution, Vz, as Dosei.v./(ki.v.×AUCi.v.). The volume of distribution at steady state, Vss, is calculated as MRTi.v.×CL. The mean residence time after intravenous administration, MRTi.v., is calculated as AUMC/AUC for bolus injection. After intravenous infusion, the mean residence time is calculated as (AUMC/AUC)−tinf/2. AUMC is the area under the first-moment versus time curve. Determination of In Vitro Stability Liver microsomes are prepared from human liver samples according to internal SOPs, whereas Syrian male hamster liver microsomes are purchased (Biopredic). The compounds are incubated at 37° C. at a total microsome protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in a 0.1 mol/L potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, in the presence of the cofactor, NADPH (1.0 mmol/L). The initial concentration of compound is 1.0 μmol/L. Samples are taken for analysis at 5 time points, 0, 7, 15, 20 and 30 minutes after the start of the incubation. The enzymatic activity in the collected sample is immediately stopped by adding acetonitrile (1:3.5), thereafter the sample is diluted 1:1 with water. The concentration of compound remaining in each of the collected samples is determined by means of LCMSMS. The elimination rate constant (k) of the soft drug is calculated as the slope of the plot of In[soft drug] against incubation time (minutes). The elimination rate constant is then used to calculate the half-life (T1/2) of the soft drug, which is subsequently used to calculate the intrinsic clearance (CLint) of the soft drug in liver microsomes as: [in-line-formulae]CLint.=(ln 2×incubation volume)/(T1/2×protein concentration)=μl/min/mg[/in-line-formulae] In Vitro Potency The compounds of formula I, XI, CI, MI have an EC50 of less than 30 μmol/l for PPARα and/or γ in reporter gene assays (Table I). For example, the compounds of Example 1 and Example 14 have EC50's for PPARα of 0.24 μmol/l and 1.4 μmol/l, respectively and EC50's for PPARγ of 1.8 μmol/l and 0.11 μmol/l, respectively in reporter gene assays.

An observed lack of activity maybe due to how the compounds are affected by assay specific factors rather than inactivity of the compounds per se for example, ester hydrolysis during compound handling or susceptibility to inactivation during prolonged incubation times. If necessary, the skilled person should be able to adapt the disclosed test conditions to make a suitable assessment of the compound activity, for example by adjusting the incubation time. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the compounds of formula (I), (XI), (CI), (MI) would have activity in a cell free assay, e.g. a binding assay. Example of Binding Assay The binding assay may be a scintillation proximity assay (SPA). In an SPA a protein is coated on scintillant incorporated beads. A radiolabelled ligand which can bind to the protein stimulates the beads to emit a signal. Binding affinities of unlabelled ligands can be determined by competitive displacement of the radioligand. These assays do not require separation of free from bound radioligand. Recombinant 6-histidine tagged PPARLBD protein can be expressed and purified from E. coli. Immobilisation of the PPAR protein on the beads can be achieved through electrostatic interactions using yttrium silicate SPA beads precoated with polylysine. Assays can be performed in multi-well format. Reaction mixes may contain, polylysine coated SPA beads, a fixed concentration of a tritiated PPAR ligand, recombinant 6-His PPAR and assay buffer. The amounts and concentrations of the reaction mix components and incubation times are determined experimentally. The formation of a radioligand/PPAR complex can be measured in a scintillation counter. Affinities of test compounds can be determined by incorporating increasing concentrations of unlabelled test compound into the assay which will lead to displacement of the radiolabelled ligand from the complex which is detected as loss of radioactive signal. Competition curves can be generated by plotting % binding versus concentration and equilibrium dissociation constants determined. 1.
