Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(6-bromo-4-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl) methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
6-Bromo-4-methoxynicotinaldehyde (1.46 g, 6.77 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-(((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (0.800 g, 3.39 mmol) in AcOH (27 ml) and water (0.305 g, 16.9 mmol), and the reaction was heated at 85° C. for 18 hours. After cooling, the reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was diluted with ethyl acetate and basified with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate. The organic layer was combined with aqueous HCl (1N), and the biphasic mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The organic layer was washed with aqueous HCl (1N), then the combined aqueous layers were extracted with ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was then basified by addition of solid K2CO3 and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×). The combined ethyl acetate extracts from the basified aqueous layer were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica flash chromatography elution gradient 10 to 100% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford (1S,3R)-1-(6-bromo-4-methoxypyridin-3-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.450 g, 30.6%) as a gum.
