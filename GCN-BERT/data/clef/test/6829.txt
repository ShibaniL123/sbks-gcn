Step 2
(5-Isopropylisoxazol-4-yl)methanol
Lithium aluminum hydride (231 mg, 5.92 mmol) was slowly dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (60 mL) at 0째C under nitrogen atmosphere and a solution of methyl 5-isopropylisoxazol-4-carboxylate (500 mg, 2.96 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) was added slowly. The reaction solution was slowlywarmed to 25째C and stirred for 1.5 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to 0째C, followed by slowly adding water (2.3 mL), 15% sodium hydroxide solution (2.3 mL) and water (9.9 mL) successively. The reaction was warmed to 25째C, stirred for half an hour, filtered and the filter cake was washed with tetrahydrofuran (10 mL x 3). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give the product (5-isopropylisoxazol-4-yl) methanol (250 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 60%.
