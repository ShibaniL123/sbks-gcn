PRIORITY CLAIM This is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/726,278, filed Mar. 21, 2007, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/784,675 filed Mar. 21, 2006 titled “Cervical Pop Rivet Locking Mechanism,” which provisional application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD The present system and method relate to bone fixation devices. More particularly, the present system and method provide for an orthopedic system including a plate, a screw system, and a screw securing system including a pop-rivet locking mechanism. BACKGROUND In the treatment of various spinal conditions, including the treatment of fractures, tumors and degenerative conditions, it is necessary to secure and stabilize the anterior column of the spine following removal of a vertebral body or part. Various devices for internal fixation of bone segments in the human or animal body are known in the art. Following such removal made using a thoracotomy, thoracoabdominal or retroperitoneal approach, the normal anatomy is reconstructed using tricortical iliac crest or fibular strut grafts. Not only are removals performed on the thoracic spine, as is the case for the above procedures, but also the cervical spine. Once bone matter is removed, it is then necessary to secure and stabilize the graft, desirably in such a manner as to permit rapid mobilization of the patient. Such objectives can be accomplished by a bone plate. However, to accomplish this service in the optimum manner, it is necessary that the plate be reasonably congruent with the bone to which it is applied, that it have as low a profile as possible, that it be firmly secured to the spinal column so that it is not torn out when the patient places weight and stress upon it and that it be capable of placement and fixation in a manner that is convenient for the surgeon. In this context it is necessary to secure the plate to the spinal body and also, in some cases, to the graft. Conventionally, such attachment would be by the use of screws driven through screw holes in the plate into the bone. However, when stabilizing the position of cervical vertebrae, the plate is designed to lie near and posterior to the esophagus of the patient. Due to its relative location to the esophagus and other connective tissue, if the screw securing the plate to the cervical spine backs out, the screw could irritate or even pierce the esophagus, resulting in pain, infection, and/or possible death of the patient. Consequently, anti-back out mechanisms are desired in the orthopedic plate industry. SUMMARY According to one exemplary embodiment, an orthopedic bone fixation device for stabilizing a plurality of bone segments includes a bone plate and a screw assembly. The bone plate includes a body defining at least one thru-bore, wherein the thru-bore is defined to include a central cavity, the central cavity having a middle diameter, an entry diameter, and an exit diameter, the middle diameter being larger than both the entry diameter and the exit diameter. Further, the screw assembly is configured to be coupled to the bone plate, wherein the screw assembly includes a bone screw having a head section, a thread section, and a central bore, an expandable ring coupled to the head section, and a pin at least partially disposed in the central bore, wherein the pin includes a varying outer profile that engages the expandable ring to vary an outer diameter of the expandable ring to lock the screw assembly in the thru-bore. According to one embodiment, the pin is configured to be pulled out from the central bore to engage an increasing diameter with the expandable ring. The frictional force exerted by the increasing diameter of the pin is increased as the pin is pulled from the bore, until the frictional force resists a pull force greater than a yield or fracture force of the pin. Upon fracture of the pin, the force exerting diameter remains acting upon the ring, while eliminating protrusions from the top of the assembly.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present specification describes a system and a method for coupling an orthopedic plate to one or more bones while preventing back-out of the fastener. Further, according to one exemplary embodiment, the present specification describes the structure of an orthopedic plate system that prevents back-out of a screw while positionally fixing bone segments. According to one exemplary embodiment, pin is used in conjunction with a split ring or other expandable ring. The pin is configured to be pulled out from a central bore of a screw to engage an increasing diameter with the expandable ring. The frictional force exerted by the increasing diameter of the pin is increased as the pin is pulled from the bore, until the frictional force resists a pull force greater than a yield or fracture force of the pin. Upon fracture of the pin, the force exerting diameter remains acting upon the ring, while eliminating protrusions from the top of the assembly. Further details of the present exemplary system and method will be provided below. By way of example, orthopedic plate systems may be used in the treatment of various spinal conditions. As mentioned, when applied to stabilize the position of cervical vertebrae, the plate portion of the orthopedic plate system is designed to lie near and posterior to the esophagus of the patient. Due to its relative location to the esophagus and other connective tissue, the top surface of the plate portion may be smooth and free of sharp corners to prevent irritation or piercing of the esophagus and surrounding tissue. Further, in order to prevent irritation and/or piercing, any connection hardware that is used to couple the plate portion to the cervical vertebrae should remain even with or below the top surface of the plate portion. If the screw or other fastener securing the plate portion to the cervical spine backs out or otherwise protrudes above the top surface of the plate portion, the screw could irritate or even pierce the esophagus, resulting in pain, infection, and/or possible death of the patient. Consequently, the present exemplary system and method provide an orthopedic plate system including a bone plate with thru-bores having varying diameters, with the larger diameter being constrained on the top and the bottom by smaller bore diameters. Further, a screw system is described below that, when assembled, is configured to leverage the varying bore diameter of the thru-bores formed in the bone plate to prevent the screw system from backing out. By using the present pin and expandable ring configuration, back-out is prevented and protrusions from the top of the assembly are eliminated. Moreover, the present exemplary system and method provides anti-back out protection with a minimal engagement surface on the bone plate. Consequently, the profile size of the bone plate, when compared to traditional orthopedic plate systems, is reduced. This reduction in profile size adds comfort to the patient by reducing the likelihood that difficulty in swallowing will develop due to the presence of the orthopedic plate system. In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present orthopedic plate system and method. However, one skilled in the relevant art will recognize that the present exemplary system and method may be practiced without one or more of these specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures associated with orthopedic plate systems have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring descriptions of the present exemplary embodiments.

Exemplary Structure FIG. 1 illustrates an assembled cervical plate system (100), according to one exemplary embodiment. As illustrated, the exemplary cervical plate system (100) includes a number of components including, but in no way limited to, a bone plate (110) and at least one screw assembly (120) coupled to the bone plate (110). According to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the screw assemblies (120) are configured to be securely coupled to a patient's bone(s) while securely coupling to the bone plate (110) to provide structural and positional stability while preventing issues with the screw assembly backing out. Further, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the exemplary cervical plate system (100), when assembled, maintains the highest point of the screw assembly (120) below the highest surface of the bone plate (110). FIG. 2 is an exploded view of the exemplary cervical plate system (100) illustrating the components of the screw assembly (120). As shown in FIG. 2, the screw assembly (120) includes, but is in no way limited to, a pull-lock pin (200), an expandable ring (210), and a bone screw (220). The various portions of the screw assembly (120) are selectively inserted into the thru bore(s) (230) formed in the exemplary bone plate (110). As mentioned, when fully engaged, the exemplary cervical plate system (100) is able to maintain a relatively low profile while providing structural support and preventing screw back out. A detailed description of each of the components of the exemplary cervical plate system (100) is provided below, followed by a description of their interaction during assembly. FIGS. 3A, 38, and 3C illustrate various views of the bone plate (110), according to one exemplary embodiment. As shown, the bone plate generally includes a main plate body (300) having a number of material cut-out(s) (310) and thru-bore(s) (230) formed therein. As illustrated, the plate body {300) of the bone plate {110) is slightly curved to follow the shape of a spinal column and may be formed out of any number of biocompatible metals including, but in no way limited to, stainless steel, titanium, or a titanium alloy. Moreover, the construction of the plate body (300) may be made of non-metal materials including, but in no way limited to, carbon reinforced Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), and the like. Additionally, as illustrated in FIGS. 3A and 38, the plate body (300) has a beveled rounded periphery to eliminate any sharp or abrupt edges that could potentially be damaging to surrounding tissue. The material cut-out{s) (310) formed in the plate body (300) may serve a number of purposes. According to one exemplary embodiment, the material cut-out(s} (310) may be designed to eliminate superfluous material, thereby reducing the overall weight of the bone plate (110), while maintaining the desired structural integrity. Additionally, the various material cut-out(s) (310) may be configured to facilitate handling of the bone plate (110) during installation or removal with a tool such as, but in no way limited to, forceps. Further, the material cut-out(s) (310) may also provide functional access to tissue and/or bone located behind an installed bone plate {110) without necessitating removal of the plate. FIG. 3C is a cross-sectional view detailing an exemplary varying profile of the thru-bore {230), according to one exemplary embodiment. As shown, a plurality of thru-bores (230) are formed in the plate body (300), six in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3A. A pair of thru-bores (230) are formed at each of the extreme ends and the center of the plate body (300), according to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3A. However, any number of thru-bore configurations may be employed in the plate body (300) to accomplish varying desired coupling points. As illustrated in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 3C, each of the exemplary thru-bore(s) (230) include a reception chamfer (320) formed at the interface with the top surface of the plate body {300). The reception chamfer {320) of the exemplary thru bore(s) (230) facilitates reception of a screw assembly (120; FIG. 2) while eliminating the formation of a sharp or potentially damaging edge at the surface of the plate body (300). Further, as shown, the thru-bore (230) includes a varying bore profile including a top reception diameter (330), a center cavity diameter (350), and an exit diameter (340) defined by a bore stop (360). According to one exemplary embodiment, described in further detail below, both the top reception diameter (330) and the exit diameter (340) of the exemplary thru-bore(s) (230) are smaller than the central cavity diameter (350). Due to the varying bore profile, a screw assembly (120; FIG. 2) having a selectively actuated expansion member may be inserted into the thru-bore{s) (230) and the expansion member actuated to approximately the diameter of the central cavity diameter {350). According to the present exemplary embodiment, expanding an expansion member, such as an expandable ring (210), to approximately the diameter of the central cavity diameter (350) will create an interference fit between the plate body (300) and the expansion member in all directions, thereby eliminating any degrees of freedom the screw assembly (120; FIG. 2) may have relative to the plate body (300). According to another exemplary embodiment, the expansion member may be actuated to a size slightly greater than that of the reception diameter (330) yet less than the central cavity diameter (350). According to this exemplary embodiment, the size of the expansion member will prevent exit of the screw assembly (120; FIG. 1)from the thru-bore (320) while allowing for movement of the screw head within the thru-bore. This movement may be beneficial as an intermediate step when a surgeon is initially placing the bone plate. Further, according to one exemplary embodiment, the bore stop protrusion (360) that defines the exit diameter (340) of the thru-bore (230) may cause the exit diameter to be smaller than the diameter of the head base (415; FIG. 4) of the screw assembly (120). Consequently, the screw assembly (120) may be inserted into a bone via the bone plate (110) until the head base (415; FIG. 4) is seated upon the bore stop (360). The incorporation of the bore stop provides for consistent insertion of the screw assembly (120) relative to the top surface of the bone plate (110). While the bore profile of the present exemplary thru-bore (230) is illustrated as having gradual changes in the internal diameter, abrupt or dramatic variations in profile of the thru-bore (230) may also define the thru-bore, according to one exemplary embodiment. FIGS. 4A through 40 detail a number of elements of a bone screw (220), according to one exemplary embodiment. As illustrated, the bone screw (220) includes features generally classified as a thread portion (400) and a head portion (410). According to one exemplary embodiment, the thread portion (400) of the bone screw (220) is configured to be affixed to the bone of a patient during spine surgery. Particularly, as shown, the thread portion (400) of the exemplary bone screw (220) may include a self-tapping leading edge (450), as is best shown in FIG. 48. According to this exemplary embodiment, the incorporation of a self-tapping leading edge in the thread portion (400) of the bone screw (220) provides the bone screw with the ability to remove bone material as it is being inserted, eliminating a step of a surgeon drilling a pilot hole prior to insertion of the bone screw. The head portion (410) of the bone screw (220) includes a number of functional features including, but in no way limited to, a plurality of driving features (420) formed on a head base {415), a ring channel (430) formed in a side of the driving features, and a pin bore (440) extending from the center of the head portion into the center of the thread portion (400). According to the present exemplary embodiment, the head portion {410) of the bone screw (410) transitions from the thread portion (400) with the head base (415). According to one exemplary embodiment, the outer diameter of the head base (415) is larger than the outer diameter of any section of the thread portion {400). By forming the head base (415) larger than the thread portion (400) of the bone screw (220), the thread portion of the bone screw may pass through an appropriately sized thru-bore (230; FIG. 2) substantially corresponding in size with the thread portion while preventing the head base from passing there through. This configuration allows for consistent insertion depth of the bone screw (220) into a desired thru-bore (230; FIG. 2). A number of protrusions in the form of driving features (420) are formed extending upwardly from the head base (415), according to one exemplary embodiment. As illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4C, the shown embodiment includes three protrusions acting as driving features (420). However, any number of driving features (420) may be formed on the head base (415), according to the teachings of the present exemplary system and method. According to one exemplary embodiment, at least the upper portion of the driving features may be engaged by a corresponding driving feature during installation. According to this exemplary embodiment, the corresponding driving feature (not shown) may engage the driving features (420) and impart a rotational force thereon, driving the thread portion (400) of the bone screw (220) into a desired bone. As illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 40, an annular groove is formed in the driving features (420) to form a ring channel (430) around the head portion (410) just above the head base (415). According to one exemplary embodiment, the ring channel {430) formed in the driving features (420) of the present exemplary bone screw (220) is sufficiently deep to receive and house an expandable ring (210; FIG. 2) in a relaxed state and retain the expandable ring when driven open to retain the screw assembly (120; FIG. 1) in a thru-bore (230; FIG. 2). A pin bore (440) is also formed in the exemplary bone screw {220), as is best illustrated in FIG. 40. According to one exemplary embodiment, the pin bore {440) is formed concentric with the axis of the bone screw (220) and has a diameter substantially similar to the diameter of the pull-lock pin (200; FIG. 2). As shown in FIG. 40, the pin bore (440) may correspond in height with a fraction of the height of a pull-lock pin (200; FIG. 2) to assure that a portion of the pull-lock pin is above the driving features (420) for grasping and pulling during operation. FIGS. SA and S8 illustrate the expandable ring (210) of the screw assembly (21O; FIG. 2), according to one exemplary embodiment. As shown in FIGS. SA and S8, the exemplary expandable ring is configured to mate with and be selectively expanded in the ring channel (430; FIG. 4A) of the bone screw (220). Specifically, the expandable ring (210) includes a substantially circular outer rib (SOO). As illustrated, the substantially circular outer rib is free of gaps or splits. Alternatively, the circular outer rib may include an expansion gap (SOS) formed therein. The width of the outer rib (SOO) is defined by the difference between the inner diameter (S30) of the outer rib and the outer diameter (S40) of the outer rib. According to one exemplary embodiment described in further detail below, the difference between the inner diameter (S30} and the outer diameter (S40) is such that the expandable ring (210) may be retained in the ring channel (430; FIG. 4A} of the bone screw (220; FIG. 2) in both an un-expanded state and an expanded state within a thru-bore (230; FIG. 2). In addition to the outer ring (SOO), the expandable ring (210) includes a number of expansion ribs (S10) protruding from the outer rib (SOO) toward the center of the expandable ring. As shown, the expansion ribs (S10) terminate in a lock pin engagement surface (S1S) and define a driving feature orifice (S20) between each pair of adjacent expansion ribs and a pin orifice (S30) between the lock pin engagement surfaces. According to one exemplary embodiment, the driving feature orifices (520) are configured to receive the driving features (420; FIG. 4C) formed on the head portion (410; FIG. 4A) of the bone screw (220; FIG. 2), during assembly. Additionally, the lock pin engagement surfaces (515) cause the pin orifice (530) to be concentrically aligned with the pin bore (440; FIG. 40) when assembled. Consequently, the engagement surfaces are configured to receive a pull-lock pin (200; FIG. 2) and translate any variations in the surface profile of the pull-lock pin to the outer rib (500) as the pull-lock pin is pulled from the pin bore (440; FIG. 40), thereby controlling the expansion and/or contraction of the outer rib (500). According to the present exemplary embodiment, the expandable ring (210) having a constant outer ring (500) will elastically or plastically bend around the areas where the expansion ribs (510) are coupled to the outer ring (500) as the pull-lock pin is pulled from the pin bore (440; FIG. 40). FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary pull-lock pin (200) according to one exemplary embodiment. As shown, the exemplary pull-lock pin (200) is a substantially cylindrical member having a proximal {670) and a distal end (675). Additionally, a number of cut outs and/or tapers are formed in the pull-lock pin (200) to create a varying outer pin diameter. According to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6, the pull-lock pin (200) includes a pull element (600) that will be exposed from the top of the bone screw (220; FIG. 2) when assembled. The pull element (200) tapers into a break taper (610) that forms the smallest diameter of the pull-lock pin (200). According to one exemplary embodiment, described in further detail below, the break taper (610) is configured to yield when a desired friction is imparted on the expandable ring (21O; FIG. 2). Additionally, when assembled, the break taper (610) engages the expandable ring (21O; FIG. 2), allowing the expandable ring to be in a relaxed state. Continuing toward the distal portion (675) of the pull-lock pin (200), an engagement taper (620) is formed adjacent to the break taper (610), leading to a lock surface (640). The engagement taper (620} is a graduated surface configured to facilitate initial alignment and engagement of the pull-lock pin (200) with the pin orifice (530; FIG. 5A) of the expandable ring (21O; FIG. 5A}. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the engagement taper (620) and the lock surface (640) are separated by a retention lip (64S). More particularly, according to one exemplary embodiment, the retention lip (64S) has an outer diameter that is greater than the lock surface (640). Furthermore, the retention lip is formed at a substantially perpendicular angle to the lock surface (640). Consequently, when an expandable ring (210; FIG. SA) engages the lock surface (640), the ring is unable to recede back to the engagement taper (620). According to one exemplary embodiment, the lock surface (640) defines an engagement diameter of the pull-lock pin (200). Particularly, according to one exemplary embodiment, the lock surface (640) has a diameter substantially corresponding to the pin orifice (S30; FIG. SA) in an expanded ring state. As illustrated, the lock surface (640) has a substantially constant diameter. However any number of graduated surfaces may also define the lock surface. During a locking step of the present exemplary system, the pull-lock pin (200) is pulled from the pin bore (440; FIG. 40) such that the lock pin engagement surfaces (S1S; FIG. SA) of the expandable ring (210) engage the lock surface (640) to expand the expandable ring to an appropriate diameter within the thru-bore (230; FIG. 2). According to one exemplary embodiment, the outer pin diameter of the lock surface (640) is sufficient to expand the expandable ring {21O; FIG. 2) to a desired friction inducing state, while still constraining the expandable ring in the ring channel (430; FIG. 4A) and without permanently deforming the expansion ring. Additionally, when the pull stop (6SO) engages the expandable ring, translation of the pull-lock pin (200) will be impeded, increasing the force exerted on the pin {200), causing the pin to yield at the break taper (610). Further detail of the function and operation of the exemplary cervical plate system (100) will be described below with reference to FIGS. 7-128. Exemplary Method FIG. 7 illustrates a method for installing the exemplary cervical plate system (100; FIG. 1), according to one exemplary embodiment. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the present exemplary method for installing the cervical plate system (100; FIG. 1) includes placing the bone plate adjacent to one or more desired vertebral bones (step 700). Once the bone plate is appropriately positioned, the screw assembly may then be presented to a thru-bore of the bone plate with the expandable ring in a relaxed state at a small diameter (step 710). The screw assembly is then driven through the thru-bore in the bone plate into the desired vertebral bone (step 720) until the enlarged head of the screw assembly is within the central cavity of the thru-bore, seated on the bore stop (step 730). Once the screw assembly is correctly positioned, the pull-lock pin may be pulled to enlarge the diameter of the expandable ring, thereby capturing the screw assembly within the thru-bore (step 740). Further details of each step of the present exemplary method will be provided below with reference to FIGS. 8 through 11. As illustrated in FIG. 7, the first step of the exemplary method is to place the plate adjacent to a desired vertebral bone (step 700). The placement of the bone plate (11O; FIG. 1) relative to a vertebral bone in a patient may be pre-operatively determined based on a pre-operative examination of the patient's spinal system using non-invasive imaging techniques known in the art, such as x-ray imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or fluoroscopy imaging, for example. Any additional preparation or work may be done on and around the desired vertebral bone prior to positionally orienting the bone plate. As illustrated in FIG. 8, the bone plate (110) is oriented such that the reception chamfer (320) is facing away from the desired bone (800), facilitating insertion of the present screw assembly. With the bone plate appropriately positioned relative to a desired vertebral bone (step 700), the screw assembly may be presented to a thru-bore of the bone plate with the expandable ring in a relaxed state (step 710). As shown in FIG. 9A, the screw assembly (120) may be delivered to the surgeon as single three piece assembly including the bone screw (220), the expandable ring (210), and the pull-lock pin (200). According to the illustrated exemplary embodiment, when delivered to the surgeon, the pull-lock pin (200) is undeployed and the expandable ring (210) is in a relaxed state. More specifically, according to one exemplary embodiment, the break taper (610; FIG. 6) of the pull-lock pin (200) is engaged with the pull-lock pin engagement surfaces (515; FIG. SA) of the expandable ring (210), as illustrated in FIG. 9B. When presented, the screw assembly (120) may then be driven through the thru-bore (230) in the bone plate (110) into a desired vertebral bone (step 720), as illustrated in FIG. 9B. As mentioned, the screw assembly (120) may be driven into the desired vertebral bone by coupling a driving tool to the driving features {420) of the bone screw (220). Once mating, the driving tool may impart a rotational force on the head portion (410) of the bone screw (220). Consequently, the self-tapping thread portion (400; FIG. 4A) of the bone screw (220) will remove bone material as it advances into the desired bone. The screw assembly (120) may be partially driven initially if multiple screw assemblies (120) are to be inserted in a single bone plate (110) or if further work is to be done by a surgeon prior to final assembly. The screw assembly (120) may be driven through the thru-bore (230) until the head portion (410) of the bone screw (220) is within the central cavity of the thru-bore (step 730), as shown in FIGS. 1OA and 1OB. As mentioned previously, consistent seating of the screw assembly (120) in the thru-bore (230) may be accomplished by driving the bone screw (220) into the thru-bore (230) until the head base (415; FIG. 4A) of the bone screw seats upon the bore stop (360; FIG. 3C) within the thru-bore. FIGS. 1OA and 1OB illustrate a screw assembly (120) seated in the thru-bore (230) as described above. As shown, by driving the bone screw (220) into the thru-bore (230) until the head base (415; FIG. 4A) of the bone screw seats upon the bore stop (360; FIG. 3C), the top surface of the head portion {410; FIG. 4A) is driven to or below the top surface of the bone plate (110). Once the screw assembly is correctly positioned in the thru-bore (230), the pull-lock pin (200) may be engaged to enlarge the diameter of the expandable ring (210), capturing the screw within the thru-bore (step 740), as illustrated in FIGS. 11A and 11B. As mentioned previously, the pull-lock pin (200) is engaged by applying a pulling force {F1} to the pull element (600) of the pull-lock pin (200). As the pull-lock pin (200} is translated upwards out of the pin bore (440}, due to the pulling force {F1), the expansion ring (210) is acted upon by the varying profile of the pull-lock pin (200). Specifically, according to one exemplary embodiment, the upward pulling force {F1) causes the pull-lock pin (200) to translate proximally from the pin bore (440), resulting in the engagement taper surface (620) of the pull-lock pin (200) imparting an outward force {F2) on the expansion ring (210). The increasing diameter of the engagement taper surface {620) imparts an increasing force on the expansion ring {210) until the lock surface (640) of the pull-lock pin is engaged and imparting a desired outward force {F2) upon the expansion ring. While an axial translation of the pull-lock pin (200) imparts a radial force on the expansion ring (21O} of the exemplary embodiment detailed herein, movement of the pull-lock pin is in no way limited to an axial translation. Rather, by way of example, a pull-lock pin {200} having a non-circular cross-sectional profile, such as a triangle or other lobed profile, may be rotated within the pin bore (440) to impart a changing radial force on the expansion ring (210}. In response to the increased outward force exerted by the lock surface (640) of the pull-lock pin (200) upon the expansion ribs {540; FIG. SA) of the expansion ring {210), the diameter of the expansion ring is enlarged about the head portion {410; FIG. 4A) of the bone screw assembly (120}. The enlarging of the expansion ring (210) about the head portion (410; FIG. 4A) of the bone screw assembly (120) imparts an outward force {F2) from the expansion ring to the inner surface of the thru-bore {230). According to one exemplary embodiment, the outward force {F2) exerted by the expansion ring (210) to the thru-bore (230) creates a frictional fit that captures the bone screw {220) within the thru-bore of the bone plate. Further, as mentioned above, the outer diameter of the expansion ring {210) in its expanded state is larger than both the reception diameter (330; FIG. 3C) and the exit diameter (340; FIG. 3C) of the exemplary thru-bore (230). Consequently, the bone screw assembly {120) is prevented from backing out from, or further advancing in the thru-bore (230). With the outward force (F2) applied by the expanded expansion ring (210), the pull element (600) of the pull-lock pin may fracture from the remaining portion of the pull-lock pin {200) at the break taper (610), similar to the operation of a pop-rivet pin. More particularly, according to one exemplary embodiment, as the pulling force {F1) is continually applied to the pull element (600), the pull-lock pin {200) will continue to translate proximally. Consequently, the lock surface {640) will translate against the edge of the expansion ring (210) until the larger diameter of the pull stop (650) comes in contact with a distal surface {212) of the expansion ring. This interference between the pull stop feature {650) and the distal surface {212) of the expansion ring (210) causes a cessation of the translation of the pull-lock pin (200). Consequently, the force being applied to the pull element (600) will be converted into an axial load exerted on the pull-lock pin (200). Due to the cross-sectional profile of the pull-lock pin (200), the highest stresses induced by the axial bad will be concentrated at the break taper (610). As a result of the high stresses, continued application of the pulling force (F1) will cause the pull-lock pin (200) to predictably yield or otherwise fracture at the break taper {610). FIGS. 12A and 128 illustrate the present exemplary system in a locked state. As illustrated, with the pull element {600) removed from the pull-lock pin (200), the remaining portion of the break taper (610) is the most proximal remaining portion of the pull-lock pin (200). As illustrated, the dimensions of the pull-lock pin (200) relative to the height of the head portion (410) of the screw assures that no portion of the pull-lock pin {200) remains above the top of the bone plate (110; FIG. 1). Additionally, as mentioned previously, once the lock surface (640) is engaged with the inner portion of the expansion ring (210), the desired outward force (F2) is maintained, thereby locking the single bone plate (110) to the screw assembly (120). Furthermore, due to the retention lip (645), back-out of the screw assembly (120) is prevented. Should a surgeon desired to de-couple the bone plate (110} from the screw assembly (120), a downward force may be applied to the top of the remaining pull-lock pin (200). When sufficient force is applied to deform either the pull-lock pin (200) or the expansion ring (210), the remaining pull-lock pin will translate into the pin bore (440), allowing the expansion ring (210) to return to a relaxed state, thereby de-coupling the screw assembly (120) from the bone plate {110). While the present exemplary orthopedic plate system {100; FIG. 1) has been described, for ease of explanation only, in the context of a cervical plate system, the present exemplary systems and methods may be applied to any number of orthopedic fixtures. Specifically, the present bone screw assembly (120) may be used to couple any number of orthopedic apparatuses to a desired bone, for any number of purposes, as long as the connecting orthopedic apparatus includes a thru-bore substantially conforming with the configurations described herein. In conclusion, the present exemplary systems and methods provide for coupling an orthopedic plate to one or more bones while preventing back-out of the fastener. Particularly, the present exemplary system is configured to leverage the varying bore diameter of a thru-bore formed in the bone plate to prevent the screw system from backing out while utilizing a minimal engagement surface on the bone plate. Consequently, the profile size of the bone plate, when compared to traditional orthopedic plate systems, is reduced and the dangers associated with screw back-out are reduced. This reduction in profile size adds comfort to the patient by reducing the likelihood that difficulty in swallowing will develop due to the presence of the orthopedic plate system.
