CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61/785,977, filed Mar. 14, 2013, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The complement system is uniquely designed to recognize, destroy and facilitate the removal of pathogens that are constantly trying to invade our bodies. The system is composed of approximately 30 plasma and cell surface proteins that incorporate both humoral and cellular effector mechanisms to provide redundant and highly efficient protection from infection. Analogous to the clotting cascade, the complement system is activated by association of specific proteins to form active complexes, generally with serine protease activity. These protease complexes activate precursor proteins that contribute to further activation (amplifying the response) or generate inflammatory mediators and cytotoxic elements. There are three main effectors generated during complement activation: C3b, C5a and C5b-9 (also called the membrane attack complex or MAC). Cellular rejection of transplanted organs can be managed by an array of cellular immune-suppressant drugs that specifically target the cellular immune response. However, a significant population of potential transplant candidates present with donor specific antibodies (DSA) that is often a contraindication for proceeding with transplantation. In addition, de novo anti-donor antibody formation appears to occur in 10-20% of transplanted patients that did not present with high panel reactivity before the transplant. These antibodies bind to the donor organ and initiate an inflammatory response by the host that results in compromised function and ultimately graft loss. Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR) is not controlled by standard immune-suppressant drugs and is increasingly recognized as a leading cause of organ rejection. DSA are able to activate the complement system, initially through classical pathway mechanisms, augmented by alternative pathway components that damage the donor organ. In addition, complement activation in the transplant setting has been suggested to occur during the surgical process of transplantation (by ischemia-reperfusion mechanisms). Complement activation products have also been demonstrated to prime and accentuate cellular rejection mechanisms. Thus, complement may contribute to the loss of a transplanted organ in a variety of ways. Factor H, which controls the conversion of C3 to C3a as well as the subsequent generation of C5a, may be effective in limiting organ rejection. The evidence for a role of complement activation in the pathology of RA is fairly extensive. Studies indicate that complement activation contributes to the pathology of RA. Elevated activation markers in RA patients and the significant protection from disease phenotype that is observed in various rodent models where different complement proteins are absent also suggests an important role for complement in RA etiology. However, work from a number of groups have demonstrated that targeting the complement inhibitor appears to be necessary to show efficacy, and that systemic administration of the un-targeted inhibitor, including FH, was ineffective. In addition, the lack of any genetic association of FH polymorphism with the development of RA appears to further weaken the link with this disease. Surprisingly, as demonstrated herein, FH given systemically does limit the pathology of RA in a mouse model. Thus, Factor H, as a protein component of the alternative pathway of complement encoded by the complement factor G gene, may be a potential therapeutic for use in preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection and for treating rheumatoid arthritis. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection by a recipient of that allograft by treating the recipient with a composition comprising Factor H (FH). In exemplary embodiments, the FH is plasma-derived FH or recombinant FH. In a further embodiment and in accordance with the above, the recipient is further treated with a first immunosuppressant composition that includes without limitation any one of sirolimus (Rapamycin), FK506 (FK), cyclosporin, and tacrolimus. In a further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the recipient is further treated with a second immunosuppressant composition that is different from the first immunosuppressant composition, where that second immunosuppressant is independently selected from sirolimus (Rapamycin), FK506 (FK), cyclosporin, and tacrolimus. In a still further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the recipient is treated with a composition comprising FH, a composition comprising FK, and a composition comprising Rapamycin. In a yet further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the allograft rejection is an antibody mediated rejection or a combination of antibody and cell mediated rejection. In a further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection includes prolonging allograft survival and/or function for a predetermined number of days. In still further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection includes preventing or inhibiting an increase in levels of markers of allograft rejection. In a still further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the allograft rejection being prevented or inhibited is acute antibody-mediated rejection. In such an embodiment, the recipient is treated with FH upon receipt of said allograft until said allograft functions normally. In an exemplary embodiment, normal function of the allograft is determined by recipient creatinine level and/or negative C4d biopsy testing. In a still further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the allograft rejection occurs 3-6 months after receipt of said allograft. In a still further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the allograft comprises an organ. In a further embodiment, the organ is a whole organ. In a still further embodiment, the whole organ is a member selected from kidney, heart, liver, intestine, pancreas and lung. In a still further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the allograft comprises tissue. In a further embodiment, the allograft is selected from a skin graft, a bone graft, a valve, and bone marrow. In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating rheumatoid arthritis in a subject, the method including the step of administering a composition comprising Factor H (FH) to the subject. In exemplary embodiments, the FH is plasma-derived FH or recombinant FH. In a further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, the FH is administered to the subject intravenously. In a still further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, administering FH results in a reduction of joint inflammation in the subject. In a yet further embodiment and in accordance with any of the above, administering FH inhibits an initial inflammatory response.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Overview The present invention provides methods for preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection and methods for treating rheumatoid arthritis, where such methods include treating a subject in need thereof with a composition that includes Factor H (“FH”). The FH used in treating a subject may be plasma-derived or recombinant Factor H. Plasma-derived FH comprises many variants, as has been described in the literature, and one or a combination of these variants may be used in the methods described herein. A large number of recombinant variants are also described in the literature, and any one or combination of such recombinant FH variants may also be used to prevent or inhibit allograft rejection or to treat rheumatoid arthritis in accordance with the methods described in further detail herein. As will be appreciated, treatment with a combination of both plasma-derived and recombinant FH is also encompassed by the present invention. Treatment with FH may be through subcutaneous administration, intravenous administration, or any other method of administration known in the art. In one aspect, the present invention provides methods for preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection by a recipient of that allograft by treating that recipient with a composition comprising FH. As is discussed above, treatment with FH may include treatment with one or more variants of FH that are plasma-derived or recombinant. The amount of FH provided may vary, but in general is in a range effective to inhibit complement activation. In further exemplary embodiments, the amount of FH used is in an amount effective to achieve a plasma concentration of about 1-2 mg/ml. In still further embodiments, the amount of FH used for treatment is in a range of 86 mg/kg. The FH may be administered to the recipient of the allograft one or more times after transplantation of the allograft at a range of intervals for a period of days, weeks or months, as is described in further detail herein. In further embodiments, the recipient of the allograft is also treated with one or more immunosuppressants in addition to FH in order to prevent or inhibit allograft rejection. The one or more immunosuppressants can include without limitation sirolimus (Rapamycin), FK506, cyclosporin, and tacrolimus. Further standard immunosuppressant therapies may also be administered to the recipient in some embodiments, including without limitation mycophenylate mofitil, and steroids. In specific embodiments, the recipient is treated with FH, FK506 and with Rapamycin to prevent or inhibit allograft rejection. Treatment with FH and the one or more immunosuppressants may be accomplished at the same time or at different time points after the receipt of the allograft. In further embodiments, treatment with FH and/or the one or more immunosuppressants is repeated after receipt of the allograft, as is described in further detail herein. In a further aspect, treatment with FH with or without one or more immunosuppressants is provided just after transplant to prevent or inhibit acute rejection, particularly acute antibody-mediated rejection. In such a method, the treatment is started at the time of transplant of the allograft and continued until the allograft is functioning. For example, in embodiments in which the allograft is a kidney, the treatment would be continued until the recipient shows normal creatinine values and biopsy testing is C4d negative. In a still further aspect, treatment with FH with or without one or more immunosuppressants is provided to prevent rejection that occurs weeks or months after transplantation. In such situations, the allograft functions normally immediately after transplantation but then deteriorates due to de novo antibody production. Treatment would in this aspect be started when the first signs of rejection manifest and continued until the allograft is again functioning normally. In exemplary embodiments, treatment with FH with or without one or more immunosuppressants in accordance with the present invention may be used to prevent or inhibit rejection of allografts that include without limitation an organ, a part of an organ or a tissue. In further exemplary embodiments, the allograft may be without limitation kidney, heart, liver, lung, pancreas, intestine, a skin graft, a bone graft, a valve, and bone marrow. In a further aspect, the present invention provides methods for treating rheumatoid arthritis in a subject by administering a composition comprising FH to that subject. As discussed above, the FH used to treat the subject may comprise one or more variants of FH, and may be plasma-derived or recombinant. In specific embodiments, the FH administered to the subject reduces joint inflammation in the subject. In further embodiments, the FH administered inhibits an initial inflammatory response and/or promotes the resolution of inflammatory response. In still further embodiments, the FH results in a reduction of exostosis in the subject or in a reduction of damage to the cartilage as compared to a subject that has not received FH. In further embodiments, the amount of FH administered to the subject is an amount effective to reduce inflammation, exostosis, or damage to cartilage as described above. In still further embodiments and as discussed above for prevention or inhibition of allograft rejection, the amount of FH administered to a subject with rheumatoid arthritis may vary, but in general is in a range effective to inhibit complement activation. In further exemplary embodiments, the amount of FH used is in an amount effective to achieve a plasma concentration of about 1-2 mg/ml. In further embodiments, the amount of FH used for treatment is in a range of 86 mg/kg. The FH may be administered to the subject one or more times at a range of intervals for a period of days, weeks or months, as is described in further detail herein. DEFINITIONS Unless otherwise specified, the term “Factor H” or “FH” as used herein refers to both plasma-derived and recombinant Factor H and further encompasses one or more variants. The term “recombinant” when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, or nucleic acid, protein, or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, under expressed or not expressed at all. The terms “isolated,” “purified,” or “biologically pure” refer to material that is substantially or essentially free from components that normally accompany it as found in its native state. Purity and homogeneity are typically determined using analytical chemistry techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. The term “purified” in some embodiments denotes that a nucleic acid or protein gives rise to essentially one band in an electrophoretic gel. In other embodiments, it means that the nucleic acid or protein is at least 50% pure, more preferably at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more pure. “Purify” or “purification” in other embodiments means removing at least one contaminant from the composition to be purified. In this sense, purification does not require that the purified compound be homogenous, e.g., 100% pure. As used herein, “administering” (and all grammatical equivalents) includes intravenous administration, intramuscular administration, subcutaneous administration, oral administration, administration as a suppository, topical contact, intraperitoneal, intralesional, or intranasal administration, or the implantation of a slow-release device, e.g., a mini-osmotic pump, to a subject. Administration is by any route including parenteral, and transmucosal (e.g., oral, nasal, vaginal, rectal, or transdermal). Parenteral administration includes, e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arteriole, intradermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intraventricular, and intracranial. Other modes of delivery include, but are not limited to, the use of liposomal formulations, intravenous infusion, transdermal patches, etc. The terms “therapeutically effective amount or dose” or “therapeutically sufficient amount or dose” or “effective or sufficient amount or dose” or “pharmaceutically effective amount or dose” refer to a dose that produces therapeutic effects for which it is administered. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug useful for treating hemophilia can be the amount that is capable of preventing or relieving one or more symptoms associated with hemophilia. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques (see, e.g., Lieberman, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms (vols. 1-3, 1992); Lloyd, The Art, Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding (1999); Pickar, Dosage Calculations (1999); and Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, 2003, Gennaro, Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes and in particular for all teachings related to developing doses and dosing regimens). “Pharmaceutically acceptable” means that which is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable and includes that which is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. By “subject” is meant any member of the subphylum chordata, including, without limitation, humans and other primates, including non human primates such as chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and horses; domestic mammals such as dogs and cats; laboratory animals including rodents such as mice, rats and guinea pigs; birds, including domestic, wild and game birds such as chickens, turkeys and other gallinaceous birds, ducks, geese, and the like. The term does not denote a particular age. Thus, both adult and newborn individuals are of interest. The term “patient,” is used in its conventional sense to refer to a living organism suffering from or prone to a condition that can be prevented or treated by administration of a composition of the invention, and includes both humans and non-human species. The terms “patient” and “subject” are used interchangeably throughout the application, and, as discussed above, these terms include both human and veterinary subjects. As used herein, the term “about” denotes an approximate range of plus or minus 10% from a specified value. For instance, the language “about 20%” encompasses a range of 18-22%. As used herein, the term “half-life” refers to the period of time it takes for the amount of a substance undergoing decay (or clearance from a sample or from a patient) to decrease by half. As used herein, the terms “sequence identity” or “% identity”, in the context of two or more nucleic acid or protein sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection. For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482 (1981); by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443 (1970); by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 2444 (1988); by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.); or by visual inspection (see generally, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pub. by Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley-Interscience (1987)). One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity is the algorithm used in the basic local alignment search tool (hereinafter “BLAST”), see, e.g. Altschul et al., J Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 (1990) and Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 15: 3389-3402 (1997), which is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (hereinafter “NCBI”). As used herein, the term “allograft” is used in its conventional sense to refer to a tissue or organ transplanted from a donor to a recipient of the same species but different genetic makeup. Compositions of the Invention The methods of the present invention include the use of compositions comprising Factor H. Unless otherwise specified, the term “Factor H” or “FH” as used herein refers to both plasma-derived and recombinant Factor H. Factor H is a protein component of the alternative pathway of complement encoded by the complement factor G gene (for example, CFH; NM000186; GeneID:3075; UniProt ID P08603; Ripoche et al., Biochem. J. 249:593-602 (1988)). Factor H is translated as a 1,213 amino acid precursor polypeptide which is processed by removal of an 18 amino acid signal peptide, resulting in the mature Factor H protein (amino acids 19-1231). As used in the present invention, Factor H encompasses any natural variants, alternative sequences, isoforms or mutant proteins that can be found in a plasma sample, for example a human plasma sample. Examples of Factor H mutations found in the human population include, without limitation, Y402H; V62I; R78G; R127L; Δ224; Q400K; C431S; T493R; C536R; 1551T; R567G; C630W; C673S; C673Y; E850K; S890I; H893R; C915S; E936D; Q950H; Y951H; T956M; C959Y; W978C; N997T; V10071; V1007L; A1010T; T1017I; Y1021F; C1043R; N1050Y; 11059T; Q1076R; R1078S; D1119G; V1134G; Y1142D; Q1143E; W1157R; C1163W; W1183L; W1183R; T1184R; L1189R; 51191L; G1194D; V1197A; E1198A; F1199S; R1210C; R1215G; R1215Q; YPTCAKR1225:1231FQS; and P1226S. Many of the these mutations have been found to be associated with a variety of diseases and disorders, including, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), membranoproliferative glomulonephritis type II (MPGNII), CFH deficiency, and basal laminar drusen. Factor H also includes proteins containing post-translational modifications. For example, Factor H is believed to be modified by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at residues 529, 718, 802, 822, 882, 911, 1029, and 1095. As will be appreciated, the Factor H used in the methods and compositions described herein may be plasma-derived or recombinant and may further comprise one or more different variants (including full-length and truncated forms). Variants of plasma-derived Factor H and methods for producing plasma-derived Factor H are known in the art and are described for example in WO 2007/149567; WO2007/066017; WO2008/113589; WO2011/011753; U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,389, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes and in particular for all teachings related to the production of Factor H, particularly plasma-derived Factor H. A wide variety of Factor H polymorphisms are known in the art and described for example in WO2000/52479; WO/2006/062716; U.S. Pat. No. 7,351,524; U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,389 (each which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes and in particular for all teachings related to Factor H and variants of Factor H), which also describe recombinant forms of these Factor H polypeptides and methods for producing the same. Many of these variant forms of Factor H are known as “protective” variants that show greater activity in limiting complement activation than plasma-derived Factor H. In non-limiting embodiments, protective variants of Factor H of use in the present invention comprise a sequence in accordance with any of the sequences described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,389, including SEQ ID NO:5 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,389, which is provided herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 in FIG. 12.

In addition to compositions comprising Factor H, methods of the invention use compositions comprising immunosuppressants. These immunosuppressants may be included in the same composition as the Factor H, or the immunosuppressants may be provided in separate compositions from Factor H. Such immunosuppressants include without limitation sirolimus (Rapamycin), FK506 (FK), cyclosporin, and tacrolimus.

Methods of Preventing or Inhibiting Allograft Rejection In one aspect, the present invention provides methods for preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection by a recipient of that allograft by treating that recipient with a composition comprising FH. As is discussed above, treatment with FH may include treatment with one or more variants of FH that are plasma-derived or recombinant. Prevention of allograft rejection is of particular importance, as rejection of an allograft can have serious consequences for the recipient. Thus, treatment to prevent rejection or inhibit the progress of rejection is a primary concern in the field of organ transplantation. The methods of the present invention can be used to prevent or inhibit the rejection of any allograft, including any whole or portion of an organ or tissue. In exemplary and non-limiting embodiments, the methods described herein for preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection can be used for allografts such as kidney, heart, liver, intestine, pancreas, lung, skin graft, bone graft, valve, and bone marrow. In further aspects, the recipient of the allograft is also treated with one or more immunosuppressants in addition to FH in order to prevent or inhibit allograft rejection. The one or more immunosuppressants can include without limitation sirolimus (Rapamycin), FK506, cyclosporin, and tacrolimus. In specific embodiments, the recipient is treated with FH, FK506 and with Rapamycin to prevent or inhibit allograft rejection. Treatment with FH and the one or more immunosuppressants may be accomplished at the same time or at different time points after receipt of the allograft. In further embodiments, treatment with FH and/or the one or more immunosuppressants is repeated periodically for a period of time after receipt of the allograft, as is described in further detail herein. In further embodiments, treatment with FH with or without one or more immunosuppressants in accordance with the present invention may be used to prevent or inhibit rejection of allografts that include without limitation an organ, a part of an organ or a tissue. In further exemplary embodiments, the allograft may be without limitation kidney, heart, liver, lung, pancreas, intestine, a skin graft, a bone graft, a valve, and bone marrow. In some aspects, the Factor H and/or immunosuppressant compositions of the invention can be administered to the recipient by intravenous, intraocular, subcutaneous, and/or intramuscular means. In further aspects, the Factor H and/or immunosuppressant compositions herein can be administered either systemically or locally. Systemic administration includes without limitation oral, transdermal, subdermal, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, transnasal, sublingual, or rectal. Local administration may include without limitation administration directly to the allograft before and/or after transplantation via perfusion, injection, or other contact with the allograft, or by administration at the site of transplantation (before and/or after transplantation), or delivery via a sustained delivery device implanted at or near the transplant site. In certain embodiments, the methods of the present invention prevent or inhibit antibody mediated rejection (AMR). In further embodiments, the methods of the present invention prevent or inhibit cell mediated rejection (CMR). In still further embodiments, methods of the present invention prevent or inhibit a combination of antibody and cell mediated rejection. In a further aspect, treatment with FH with or without one or more immunosuppressants is provided just after transplant to prevent or inhibit acute rejection, particularly acute antibody-mediated rejection. In such a method, the treatment is started at the time of transplant of the allograft and continued until the allograft is functioning normally. Methods for determining whether the allograft is functioning normally will depend on the organ or tissue being transplanted and such assays of normal function are well known in the art for particular organs. For example, in embodiments in which the allograft is a kidney, the treatment would be continued until the recipient shows normal creatinine values and biopsy testing is C4d negative. In a still further aspect, treatment with FH with or without one or more immunosuppressants is provided to prevent or inhibit a delayed rejection that occurs weeks or months after transplantation. In such situations, the allograft functions normally immediately after transplantation but then deteriorates due to de novo antibody production. Treatment would in this aspect be started when the first signs of rejection manifest and continued until the allograft is again functioning normally. Again, methods for determining whether the allograft is functioning will depend on the organ or tissue being transplanted and are well known in the art. For example, in embodiments in which the allograft is a kidney, the treatment would be continued until the recipient shows normal creatinine values and biopsy testing is C4d negative. For any of the methods for preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection discussed herein, the Factor H discussed may be plasma-derived or recombinant and may further comprise one or more different variants (including full-length and truncated forms). In exemplary embodiments, the Factor H used in methods for preventing or inhibiting allograft rejection include recombinant protective variants of Factor H that comprise a sequence in accordance with any of the sequences described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,389, including SEQ ID NO:5 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,389, which is provided herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 in FIG. 12. In further embodiments, a recombinant Factor H is used in methods and compositions of the invention where that recombinant Factor H has at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% and 100% sequence identity to any of the sequences described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,389. In still further embodiments, the recombinant Factor H of use in the present invention has at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% and 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:5 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,389, which is provided herein as SEQ ID NO: 1 in FIG. 12. In yet further embodiments, the recombinant Factor H of use in the present invention comprises SEQ ID NO: I pictured in FIG. 12 with about 1-100, 3-95, 5-90, 7-85, 9-80, 11-75, 13-70, 15-65, 17-60, 19-55, 21-50, 23-45, 25-40, 27-35 amino acid substitutions.

EXAMPLES Example 1 Use of Factor H for Treating Transplant Rejection Male C3H (H-2k) and C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b) mice (25-30 g) were used to determine the efficacy of Complement Factor H (CFH) during transplant rejection. C3H mice served as skin graft and kidney donors for pre-sensitization and kidney transplantation. Male C57BL/c (B6) mice were used as recipients. The B6 recipients were pre-sensitized by transplantation of the donor skin grafts, and were subsequently transplanted with kidney allografts between 15 and 20 days after the skin transplantation. B6 mice were treated with vehicle (controls), CFH (day −1, day 0, then every other day to day 10; 8 mg/mouse, i.p.), FK506 (daily from day −1 to day 10; 1 mg/kg s.c.) or the combination of CFH+FK506 using the same dosage regime as the single treatments. Mice were monitored daily for signs of rejection. Renal function was monitored by measuring serum creatinine levels. Untreated C3H kidneys grafted into pre-sensitized recipients were rejected rapidly, as indicated by an increased creatinine (Cr) level measured on POD7 (FIG. 2). Untreated grafts lost graft function (Cr>2 mg/d1) with a median survival of 7.5 days due to graft function deterioration. Treatment with CFH alone reduced plasma Cr levels (1.4±0.2 mg/dl, vs. 1.9±0.1 in controls), thus improving renal allograft function. CFH in combination with FK506 further improved graft function, suggesting that CFH can limit IRI in the acute transplant setting (FIG. 2). Example 2 Use of Rapamycin in Combination with Factor H for Treating Transplant Rejection Male C3H (H-2k) and C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b) mice (25-30 g) were used to determine the efficacy of Rapamycin (RAPA) in combination with Factor H (FH) during transplant rejection. C3H mice served as skin graft and kidney donors for pre-sensitization and kidney transplantation. Male C57BL/c (B6) mice were used as recipients. The B6 recipients were pre-sensitized by transplantation of the donor skin grafts, and were subsequently transplanted with kidney allografts between 15 and 20 days after the skin transplantation. Transplanted B6 mice were treated with Rapamycin (RAPA) alone (daily from day −1 to day 10; 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), RAPA+CFH (CFH treatment=day −1, day 0, then every other day to day 14, then 2× per week to endpoint; 8 mg/mouse, i.p., CFH i.p. recipients also received an IV infusion of a single dose infusion of Adrenomedullin mixed with CFH during transplant surgery, 100 μg/kg; RAPA treatment=daily from day-1 to day 10; 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), RAPA+FK506 (FK=daily from day −1 to day 10, then every other day to endpoint; 3 mg/kg s.c.; RAPA=daily from day-1 to day 10; 0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) or the combination of RAPA+CFH+FK506 using the same dosage regime as above. The experimental groups were a) C3H to B6 txs+pre-sensitization+RAPA; b) C3H to B6 txs+pre-sensitization+CFH+RAPA; c) C3H to B6 txs+pre-sensitization FK+RAPA; and d) C3H to B6 txs+pre-sensitization+CFH+FK+RAPA. (“txs”=“transplantation/skin graft”) Mice were monitored daily for signs of rejection and were euthanized at the end point of the experiment, which was defined as when transplants developed functional deterioration due to severe rejection or on POD60 and POD100. Renal graft function was monitored by plasma creatinine (Cr) blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and hematocrit (Hct) levels by an I-Stat potable analyzer (Abaxis). Circulating donor specific antibodies (DSAs) were determined prior to kidney transplantation and at the endpoint of study by flow cytometry. CFH in combination with RAPA and FK (CFH+RAPA+FK) protected kidney allograft rejection from acute AMR and CMR, and prolonged kidney allograft survival in the pre-sensitized recipients. As shown in Table 1 and FIG. 3, short-term RAPA monotherapy or RAPA in combination with CFH (CFH+RAPA) demonstrated a protective effect. With an improvement of early graft function at POD7 (FIG. 4), treatment with RAPA alone or RAPA+FH prolonged the allograft survival from 8 days (mean survival time—“MST”) in the untreated allografts (controls) to 14 and 16 days (MST), respectively. Treatment with RAPA and FK combination (RAPA+FK) further prolonged the renal allograft survival to 44 days (MST). Triple therapy with CFH+RAPA+FK effectively prevented graft rejection and achieved long-term kidney allograft survival. As a result, 87.5% (⅞) of the renal allografts with the triple therapy achieved long-term survival (>60 days) (p<0.05 vs. RAPA+FK). TABLE 1 Individual graft survival in pre-sensitized kidney transplant model.

To evaluate the influence of CFH on renal function, plasma samples were collected from the kidney allografts. Cr, BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and Hematocrit (Hct) were measured on POD7, POD21, and POD60, or terminal rejection. The plasma concentrations of the waste substances, such as Cr and BUN, are commonly used in clinical practice to determine renal function. Elevation of Cr and BUN beyond the normal range (in normal B6 mice, Cr=0.2±0.05 mg/dl, BUN=34±8.81 mg/dl) indicates a loss of kidney function. The hematocrit is the volume percentage (%) of red blood cells in blood. A decrease in Hct (normal Hct-44±1.73% PCV) is associated with kidney injuries due to decreased production of the hormone erythropoietin. The results in FIG. 4 show that the Cr and BUN levels were increased in the controls on POD7. While all immunotherapies with RAPA or RAPA+CFH or RAPA+FK demonstrated protection of early renal function (POD7) with reduced Cr and BUN and increased Hct compared to controls, the triple therapy achieved long-term improvement of renal function as indicated by decreased Cr and BUN levels, and increased Hct (FIG. 4) on POD21 and at the endpoint (rejection or POD60) as compared to the treatment with only FK and RAPA. To determine whether continued treatment with FK and CFH could further extend graft survival, the remaining two kidney allografts with RAPA+FK and three with CFH+RAPA+FK were followed up until POD100. As shown in Table 2, the results indicated that all transplants with the triple therapy survived to 100 days and maintained normal renal function.

The grafts that were rejected within 4 weeks showed severe AMR and CMR (data not shown), with a histological rejection features similar to those observed in untreated pre-sensitized recipients (FIG. 5A), regardless of whether they were treated with RAPA alone, RAPA+CFH, or RAPA+FK. In contrast, transplants with CFH+RAPA+FK triple therapy showed less inflammation and tubular damage with decreased monocyte infiltration, decrease tubular atrophy and segmental glomerulosclerosis, and decreased fibrotic changes in comparison with FK/RAPA treated grafts when examined at 8 weeks (FIG. 5B). Furthermore, the CFH+RAPA+FK triple therapy reduced the severity of AMR injuries (peritubular capillaritis, glomerularitis, and glomerular thrombi and mesangiolysis). Example 3 The Effect of CFH in Combination with Adrenomedullin for Treating Transplant Rejection The effect of CFH with or without Adrenomedullin (AM) on kidney graft function, antibody response, and histology was determined following the early phase of transplantation (POD3 and POD5). The pre-sensitized kidney transplants were treated with CFH (8 mg, i.p.) on day −1, day 0 and then every other day. To test whether AM provides additional benefits to renal graft function, an additional group of transplants were treated with a single dose infusion (200 μl, i.v.) of AM (˜100 ug/kg) mixed with CFH (˜1 mg/kg) immediately following the transplant surgery (POD0), in addition to the i.p. injection of CFH (day −1, 0, and every other day). CFH is a serum-binding protein for AM. It has been shown that AM influences the complement regulatory function of Factor H by enhancing the cleavage of C3b via Factor I. Preparation of AM+CFH solution was prepared as follows: a) dissolve vial contents of AM (100 μg) in 4.166 ml of sterile saline (to make a 24 μg/ml working stock solution); b) dilute 14.4 μl of 15.6 mg/ml FH stock in 985.6 μl of sterile saline (to make a 225 μg/ml working stock solution of FH); c) mix equal volumes (950 μl each) of the 24 μg/ml working stock of AM with the 225 μg/ml working stock of FH to make the final infusion solution (AM concentration will be 12 μg/ml; FH concentration will be 112.5 μg/ml). Transfer 220 μA aliquots to sterile tubes and freeze at −70 until ready for use. All mice were sacrificed on POD3 and 5, respectively (˜5/ea). Untreated transplants sacrificed at the same endpoints were used as controls. Graft tissues were harvested for histology and immune-histochemistry (IHC). The experimental groups were as follows: 1) C3H to B6 txs+pre-sensitization+control; 2) C3H to B6 txs+pre-sensitization+CFH (i.p.); and 3) C3H to B6 txs+pre-sensitization+CFH (i.p.)+AM/CFH infusion (at time of transplant). As shown in FIG. 6A, Cr levels increased by POD5 in untreated transplants (P<0.01, vs. normal B6). CFH alone and CFH with AM+CFH as a single infusion treatment showed a trend of improved renal function as the mean Cr level in these groups were lower compared to the controls. Addition of a single dose AM/CFH infusion was beneficial in further reducing the Cr level on POD5. Histological examinations by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining (FIG. 6B) revealed that control kidney allografts in the pre-sensitized recipients had early signs of mixed acute cellular and humoral rejection by POD5 (mononuclear cell infiltration, endothelium activation, edema, focal acute renal tubular necrosis). The kidney grafts treated with CFH showed an improved morphology with less tubular necrosis on POD5. To determine plasma DSA levels, plasma samples from kidney transplant recipients were collected one day prior to kidney transplantation (2 weeks after donor skin graft pre-sensitization) and the endpoint of the study. DSA levels were measured by flow cytometry. FIG. 7 shows that a significant increase of DSA (IgG) and IgG levels as expressed by mean channel fluorescence intensity (MFI) were comparable among the groups. There was no correlation between IgG levels and Cr levels (FIG. 7B). Example 4 Use of Factor H for Treating Rheumatoid Arthritis Balb C mice (n=10 per cohort) were used to determine the efficacy of Factor H (FH) during transplant rejection. The mice were treated with ArthritoMAb (anti-collagen) antibody cocktail (2 mg, i.v.) on day 1, followed 7 days later with an injection of LPS (50 μg, i.p.). On day 8, hind paw volumes were measured for each animal and distributed to various treatment groups. Factor H was formulated in 20 mM Citrate, 150 mM NaCl, pH=6. Dexamethasone was formulated in 0.5% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose/0.2% Tween 80. Ethanercept was formulated as Enbrel™ in saline. Vehicle was formulated in 20 mM Citrate, 150 mM NaCl, pH=6. The dosing volume for dexamethasone and etanercept was 10 mL/kg (0.200 mL/20 g mouse) and adjusted accordingly for body weight. The dosing volume for Factor H and BX12 was 25 mL/kg (0.500 mL/20 g mouse) and adjusted accordingly for body weight. Dosing with the different agents was started on day 8 as described in Table 3.

The age at start date was 7 to 9 weeks. Body weights were measured bi-weekly to the endpoint (Table 4). At the endpoint, tissue samples were processed for histology and submitted to a pathologist for independent analysis. Sampling 1 was performed at the endpoint. The hind limbs were preserved in 10% formalin. Sampling 2 was performed at the endpoint for group 4 animals. Blood was collected by terminal cardiac puncture. The blood was processed for anti-coagulant. The kidneys were additionally preserved in formalin and followed with 70% EtOH. Samples were scored for inflammation, pannus (granulation tissue), cartilage damage, bone resorption and exostosis (Table 5). TABLE 4 Body weight measurements.

In addition, FH performed well compared to Etanercept (FIG. 9; Bx-12=FH). FH improves more over Etanercept at later time points (days 15 to 22), suggesting that FH promotes rapid resolution of the inflammatory response in addition to inhibiting the initial inflammatory response (FIG. 10).

The Dexamethasone control consistently produced an improved histopathology result. FH inhibits exostosis (the inappropriate formation of new bone on the surface of bone) compared to both vehicle control and Etanercept. There was additionally a trend toward improved inflammation and bone resorption for FH-treated mice, resulting in a lower clinical score compared to both vehicle and Etanercept (FIG. 11). This RA animal model study suggests that Factor H is an effective therapeutic in limiting the complement-mediated inflammatory response in this disease setting. TABLE 9 Footpad thickness.
