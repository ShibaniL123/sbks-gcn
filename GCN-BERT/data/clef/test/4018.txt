A solution of (±)-tert-butyl ((1 S*,2S*,5R*)-5-(benzyloxy)-2-fluorocyclohexyl)carbamate (17a, 1.88 g, 5.81 mmol) and Pd(OH)2/C (1.0 g) in methanol (100 mL) was stirred under 45 psi hydrogen at room temperature for 18 h. The catalyst was filtered off and the filtrate concentrated to afford (±)-tert-butyl ((1S*,2S*,5R*)-2-fluoro-5-hydroxycyclohexyl)carbamate (17b, 1.36 g, 100%) as white solid which was used without further purification.
