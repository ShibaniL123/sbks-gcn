DETAILED DESCRIPTION Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. Turning to the figures, an equipment storage device is illustrated and designated with the reference numeral 10. The storage device includes a container 12 with an integrally reservoir 14 and receptacles 16. A cover 18 is coupled with the container to prohibit access inside the container 12 and receptacles 16. Wheels 15 and a handle 17 may be coupled with the container 12. The container 12 has an overall rectangular shape with a bottom 20 and a peripheral wall 22. The bottom 20 and peripheral wall 22 could include insulative material, if desired. The peripheral wall 22 includes a major sidewall 24 and minor sidewalls 26. The peripheral wall generally has a height of at least 18 inches. However, it could be from 2 to 4 feet. The major sidewall 24 have a length of about two feet, however, they could be larger or smaller depending on design. The minor sidewalls 26 have a length of about 18 inches and thus generally have an overall square configuration. Additionally, they could be 2 to 4 feet. The bottom 20 has an overall rectangular shape with a width of at least 18 inches and a length of 24 inches. This provides a large area for a user 25 to comfortably stand in when the user is rinsing after his activity. The bottom 20 includes a drain 28. The drain 28 is below the surface of the bottom 20. A grate 29 may cover the drain 28. The drain 28 includes a bore 30 that enables the drain 28 to enable fluid to exit from inside the container 12 to outside of the container 12. Generally, the bore 30 is unitarily formed in the bottom 20; however, a hose or the like could be used. Additionally, a plug 31 or the like could be utilized in the bore if it is desirable to utilize the container to retain fluid. The reservoir 14 is generally unitarily formed with a minor sidewall 26 of the container 12. The reservoir 14 generally has an overall rectangular configuration to hold a fluid such as water to enable the surfer to rinse after surfing. The reservoir generally includes a showering mechanism 32 coupled with the reservoir. The showering mechanism 32 generally includes a pump 34 and a hose 36 with a head 38. The pump 34 is removable from the reservoir 14 providing an aperture 40 in the reservoir. The aperture 40 in the reservoir 14 enables the reservoir 14 to be filled with fluid. The pump 34 is generally a manual type where the pump 34 is manually pushed up and down to create pressure in the reservoir 14 which, in turn, enables pressurized fluid to exit through the hose 36 and out the head 38 onto the user 25 in the container 12. Thus, the user 25 may shower after beach activity, such as surfing, disrobe from her wetsuit, and utilize fresh water to clean the user 25 as well as the wetsuit. A solar panel 42 may be coupled with the reservoir 14. The solar panel 42 may include a heating element 44 positioned in the fluid inside of the reservoir 14. Thus, as the storage device 10 sits out in the sun while the beach activity is conducted, the water inside the reservoir 14 may be heated so that when the user is finished, he may take a warm rinse to clean off his wetsuit as well as himself. Also, the reservoir 14 may include a hose hanger 70. The hose hanger 70 includes a plurality (four are shown) of hooks 72. The hooks 72 are L-shaped and enable the hose 36 to be wrapped to provide a pleasing aesthetic appearance. The external surface of the peripheral wall 22 includes the receptacles 16. The receptacles 16 are generally unitarily formed with the peripheral wall 22. The receptacles 16 may be divided into a number of receptacles to receive surfing gear. The receptacles 16 on the major sidewall 24 of the peripheral wall 22 may be utilized to store wax or the like. Generally, the major sidewall 24 includes three to four unitarily formed receptacles 16. The minor sidewall 26 of the container 12 may include a pair of receptacles 16. The receptacles generally extend the entire height of the container. Thus, the receptacle 16 or pockets may be used to receive fins, leashes or the like. A speaker assembly 60 may be associated with the minor sidewall 26. The speaker assembly 60 includes a pair of waterproof speakers 62, 62, as well as jacks 64 to connect with smartphones, MP3 players and the like. The cover 18 may include snaps 48 or the like to secure the cover onto the container 12. When the cover 18 is pulled over the container to deny access, the cover additionally covers the receptacles or pockets 16 to prohibit entry into the pockets 16. The cover 18 could be fitted with a locking device 50 so that unauthorized entry into the storage device 10 is prohibited. Alternatively, a lid portion 80 of the cover 18, covering the container, is a sturdy rigid planar lid for providing a sitting area on top of the container 12 (see FIG. 14). Also, a flexible portion 82 extends from the lid 80 to attach with the locking device 50. While the container 12 is illustrated with a peripheral wall and a unitary reservoir and receptacles or pockets, it is understood that the reservoir as well as the receptacles or pockets could be attached to and removable from the container 12. Additionally, the receptacles and reservoir could be manufactured from a fabric type of material and coupled with the container 12. Additionally, the equipment storage device 10 may also be used for storage of sand toys and for showering of children while at the beach.
