BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a control device of medical treatment equipment, and in particular to an automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device combined with medical treatment equipment to control the operation of an X-ray detector of the medical treatment equipment for adjusting the X-ray detector to aligned with a predetermined selected body portion of a target human body. 2. The Related Arts Currently, regular medical examination often applies X-ray imaging. The X-ray imaging generally uses and adjusts shielding plates to determine a radiation area. In a conventional design, a radiographer needs to manually or semi-automatically adjust the shielding plate through upward/downward and left/rightward movement in order to select a desired portion and area of the portion to be irradiated. The X-ray detector is commonly designed as a fixed device. In an alternative design, the X-ray detector is held by a hand and manually placed at the portion of human body that is to be irradiated. In the conventional designs of the X-ray detector, a radiographer or medical personnel has to help a patient to make a correct pose and position, or a person other than the radiographer may be need to hold the X-ray detector with hands. The radiographer then proceeds to a collimator to adjust the shielding plate. This causes an issue of poor operability. Further, during the operation that a radiographer or medical personnel makes the adjustment, deviations and inconsistencies of the accuracy of adjustment, the size of the radiation area, and the radiation zone may readily occur due to difference in respect of personal experience, expertise, habit, and personal emotional issues. When an X-ray photograph is incorrect in respect of the radiation range or radiation area, incorrect reading of visual inspection by a treating operator may occur and incorrect diagnosis may also result. Further, the chance that a patient has to take the examination once more due to the error of the operation may often be thus greatly increased. It is thus a challenge to the industry to overcome the above-discussed problems and issues. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Thus, to overcome the above-discussed problems and issues, an object of the present invention is to provide an automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device for medical treatment equipment, in which an image characteristic identification unit receives an instant image pixel depth signal captured by a depth camera and carries out image characteristic comparison between the instant image pixel depth signal and a predetermined image pixel depth signal of a predetermined human body portion for identification and in response thereto, generates an X-ray detector position signal to allow an X-ray detector position adjustment mechanism to drive an X-ray detector of the medical treatment equipment to move along a guide mechanism thereby adjusting the X-ray detector to align with a predetermined human body portion of a target human body. The technical solution that the present invention adopts to achieve the above object is that an automatic X-ray detector adjustment device is combined with medical treatment equipment, in which an automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device is included in the medical treatment equipment. The automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device includes a depth camera, an image characteristic identification unit, and an X-ray detector position adjustment mechanism. The image characteristic identification unit performs image characteristic comparison between an instant image pixel depth signal with a predetermined image pixel depth signal for identification and generates, in response thereto, an X-ray detector position adjustment signal. Then, the X-ray detector position adjustment mechanism drives the X-ray detector to move in order to adjust the X-ray detector to correspond to the predetermined human body portion of a target human body. The automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device for medical treatment equipment further comprises an image capture device to acquire at least one instant image of the target human body. The automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device for medical treatment equipment comprises a vertical carrying frame and the guide mechanism is provided on the vertical carrying frame. The X-ray detector may be alternatively mounted to a horizontal carrying frame. The guide mechanism comprises: a first-direction guide mechanism, which is mounted to the horizontal carrying frame in a first direction, and a second-direction guide mechanism, which is mounted to the horizontal carrying frame in a second direction. The X-ray detector position adjustment mechanism comprises: a first-direction driving unit, which drives the X-ray detector to move along the first-direction guide mechanism, and a second-direction driving unit, which drives the X-ray detector to move along the second-direction guide mechanism. The X-ray detector position adjustment mechanism may further comprise a rotation driving unit, which drives the X-ray detector to rotate about a rotation axial direction. The automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device for medical treatment equipment may further comprise a display device. The efficacy is that with the above technical solution of the present invention, medical personnel, when operating an X-ray detector of an X-ray medical treatment equipment, may use the automatic X-ray detector adjustment device of the present invention to automatically detect a predetermined human body portion of a target human body, whereby errors caused by lacking of experience or poor habit of a radiographer can be reduced and the inconvenience and time required for manual adjustment of a X-ray detector by a radiographer may be greatly reduced. In addition, the difficult that a patient needs to change pose thereof to correspond to the X-ray detector can be eliminated. Further, the automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device of the present invention is operable with a collimator control device to adjust a collimator for adjustment toward a selected human body portion.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS With reference to the drawings and in particular to FIG. 1, a first embodiment is illustrated, in which medical treatment equipment 100 is arranged to include an X-ray source generator 1, a collimator 11, and an X-ray detector 2. The X-ray source generator 1 is coupled to the collimator 11. The X-ray detector 2 is arranged at a position that is spaced from the X-ray source generator 1 by a predetermined distance. The X-ray source generator 1 emits an X-ray beam 15, which, after passing through shielding plates 12 and a filter 13 arranged in the collimator 11, is projected to a target human body 3 and is detected by the X-ray detector 2. The collimator 11 is coupled to a collimator control device 14, whereby the collimator control device 14 controls the shielding plate 12 arranged in the collimator 11 for adjustment of a selected human body portion 31 of the target human body 3. In the present invention, an automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device 200 is combined with and coupled to the medical treatment equipment 100 to control the operation of the X-ray detector 2 of the medical treatment equipment 100 in order to execute identification of the selected human body portion and make adjustment toward a predetermined human body portion 31 of the target human body 3. The automatic selected human portion identification and adjustment device 200 according to the present invention comprises a processor unit 4, a depth camera 5, an image capture device 51, an image data storage device 6, a display device 7, an image characteristic identification unit 8, and an X-ray detector position adjustment mechanism 9. The depth camera 5 is set at a position corresponding to the target human body 3 in order to acquire at least one instant image pixel depth signal S1 of the target human body 3. The depth camera 5 is connected to the processor unit 4 to transmit the acquired instant image pixel depth signal S1 to the processor unit 4. In addition to the depth camera 5, an image capture device 51 may be provided and connected to the processor unit 4 in order to acquire at least one instant image S11 of the target human body 3 and transmit the instant image S11 to the processor unit 4. The image data storage device 6 is connected to the processor unit 4. The image data storage device 6 stores therein at least one predetermined image pixel depth signal 61 of the predetermined human body portion 31. The display device 7 is connected to the processor unit 4 to display the instant image pixel depth signal S1 of the target human body 3 acquired the depth camera 5 and the instant image S11 of the target human body 3 acquired by the image capture device 51. The image characteristic identification unit 8 is connected to the processor unit 4 for comparison and identification of characteristics. The process unit 4 compares the instant image pixel depth signal S1 acquired the depth camera 5 and the predetermined image pixel depth signal 61 of the predetermined human body portion 31 of the image data storage device 6 for identification. According to the result of comparison, if the instant image pixel depth signal S1 and the predetermined image pixel depth signal 61 of the predetermined human body portion 31 are different, the processor unit 4 generates, according to the difference between the instant image pixel depth signal S1 and the predetermined image pixel depth signal 61, at least one X-ray detector position adjustment signal S2 that is transmitted to the X-ray detector position adjustment mechanism 9. The X-ray detector position adjustment mechanism 9, after receiving the X-ray detector position adjustment signal S2, generates a movement driving signal S3 for driving the X-ray detector 2 to move thereby adjusting the X-ray detector 2 to correspond to the predetermined human body portion 31 of the target human body 3. As shown in FIG. 2, in an embodiment of the present invention, the collimator control device 14 comprises a vertical direction drive motor 14a, a horizontal direction drive motor 14b, and a rotation drive motor 14c.
