Scheme X depicts the synthesis of a variant of the foregoing in which Ring Β is a 2-pyridine and L1 is G{0)NH (1.℮., in the other orientation). Schemes Xi and XII, below, illustrate the synthesis, of W-[Ring AH^HRing B] in which Rings A and Β are phenyl and Ring C is a heteroaryl ring. These intermediates are useful for making compounds of formula II, More specifically, Scheme XI describes the preparation of intermediates in which Ring C Is an imldazoie ring.

For instance, a number of compounds of this invention have been shown to Inhibit tyrosine kinase activity of Src and abi, among other tyrosine kinases which are , believed to mediate tbs growth, development and/or metastasis of cancer. A number of compounds of the invention have also been found to possess potent in vitro activity against cancer ℮βϋ lines, including among others K-562 teukemia cells. Observed potencies have been as much as 10-fold more powerful than Gleevec in conventional antiproliferation assays with Κ562 ceils, Such compounds are thus of Interest for the treatment of cancers, including both primary and metastatic cancers, including solid tumors as well as iymphomas and leukemias (including CIVIL, AML and ALL), and including cancers which are resistant to other therapies, including other therapies involving the administration of kinase inhibitors such 'as Gleevec, Tarcevaor iressa. Such cancers inciude, among others, cancers of the breast, cervix, colon and rectum, king, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, head and neck, gastrointestinal stroma, as well as diseases such as melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma, gastric cancers and leukemias (e.g., myeloid, lymphocytic, myelocytic and lymphoblastic leukemias) including cases which are resistant to one or more other therapies, including among others, Gleevec, Tarceva or Iressa. Resistance to various anticsncer agents can arise from one or more mutations in 0 mediator or effector of the cancer (e.g,, mutation in a kinase such as Src or Abl) which correlate with alteration in the protein's drug binding properties, phosphate binding properties, protein binding properties, autoreguiation or other characteristics. For example, in the case of BCR-Abi, the kinase associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, resistance to Gleevec has been mapped ΐο a variety of BCR/Abl mutations which are linked to a variety of functional consequences, including among others, steric hindrance of drug occupancy at the kinase’s active site, alteration in defarmabiiity of the phosphate binding Ρ loop, effects on the conformation of the activation ioop surrounding the active site, and others. See e,g. Shah et al, 2002, Cancer Cell 2,117 - 125 and Azam et ai, 2QQ3, Celi 112, 831 - 843 and references cited therein for representative examples of such mutations in Bcr/Abl which correlate with drug resistance.

Pharmaceutical Methods The method of the Invention comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the Invention. A ’"therapeutically effective amount" is that amount effective for detectable killing or inhibition of the growth or spread of cancer cells; the size or number of tumors; or other measure of the level, stage, progression or severity of the cancer. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the disease, the particular anticancer agent, Its mode of administration, combination treatment with other therapies, and the like. The compound, or a composition containing the compound, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of tumors or other forms of cancer. The antioanoer compounds of the invention are preferably formulated In dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression “dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of anticancer agent appropriate for the patient to be treated, As is normally the case, the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present Invention will be decided by the attending physician using routine reliance upon sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated; the severity of the disorder; the potency of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, genera! health, sex and diet of the patient; the route and schedule of administration; the rate of metabolism and/or excretion of the compound; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincident with administration of the compound of this invention; and like factors well known in the medical arts. Furthermore, after formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectatty, parenterally, Intracisternally, intravaglnaily, intraperitoneally, topically (as by iransderrnal patch, powders, ointments, or drops), sublingually, bucatly, as an oral or nssal spray, or the tike. The effective systemic dose of the compound will typically be in the range of 0.01 to 600 mg of compound per kg of patient body weight, preferably 0.1 to 126 mg/kg, and in some cases 1 to 25 mg/kg, administered in single or multiple doses. Generally, the compound may be administered to patients in need of such treatment in a daily dose range of about 60 to about 2000 mg per patient. Administration may be once or srsuitipie times daiiy, weekly (or at some other muitipie-day inierval) or on art intermittent schedule. For example, the compound may be administered one or more times per day on a weekly basis {e.g. every Monday) indefinitely or for a period of weeks, e.g. 4 - 10 weeks. Alternatively, it may be administered daiiy for a period of days (e.g, 2 - 10 days) followed by a period of days (e.g. 1 - 30 days) without administration of ihe compound, with that cycle repeated indefinitely or for a given number of repltitions, e.g. 4-10 cycles. As an example, a compound of the invention may be administered daily for 6 days, then discontinued for 9 days, then administered daiiy for another 5 day period, then discontinued for 9 days, and so on, repeating the cycle indefinitely, or for a total of 4 - 10 times. The amount of compound which will be effective in the treatment or prevention of a particular disorder or condition wilt depend in part on well known factors affecting drug dosage, in addition, in vitro or in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help Identify optimal dosage ranges, A rough guide to effective doses may be extrapolated from doss-response curves derived from in vitro or animal modei test systems. The precise dosage level should be determined by the attending physician or other health care provider and will depend upon well known factors, including route of administration, and the age, body weight, sex and general health of the individual; the nature, severity and clinical stage of the disease; the use (or not) of concomitant therapies; and the nature and extent of genetic engineering of ceils in the patient When administered for the treatment or inhibition of a particular disease state or disorder, ihe effective dosage of the compound of this invention may vary depending upon the particular compound utilized, the mode of administration, the condition, and severity thereof, of the condition being treated, as well as the various physical factors related to the individual being treated, in many cases, satisfactory results may be obtained when the compound is administered in a daily dosage of from about 0.01 mg/kg-5GG mg/kg, preferably between G.1 and 125 mg/kg, and more preferably between 1 and 25 mg/kg. The projected daily dosages are expected to vary with route of administration. Thus, parenteral dosing will often be at levels of roughly 10% to 20% of ora! dosing levels, When the compound of this invention Is used as part of a combination regimen, dosages of each of ihe components of ihe combination are administered during a desired treatment period. The components' of ihe combination may administered at the same time; either as a unitary dosage form containing both components, or as separate dosage units; the components of the combination can also be administered at different times during a treatment period, or one may be administered as a pretreatment for the other.

Kinases suitable for use in the following protocol include, but are not limited to: Abl, Lck, Lyn, Src, Fyn, Syk, Zap-70, itk, Tec, BtK, EGFR, ErbB2, Kdr, Fit1, Flt-3, Tek, c-Met, insR, and ΑΚΤ. Kinases are expressed as.either kinase domains or full length constructs fused to glutathione S-trsnsferase (GST) or poiyHistidine tagged fusion proteins in either Ε, coll or Bacuiovirus-High Five expression systems. They are purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography as previously described (Lehret a!., 1996; Gish et a!,, 1995). In some instances, kinases are so-expressed or mixed with purified or partially purified regulatory polypeptides prior to measurement of activity. Kinase activity and Inhibition can be measured by established protocols (see e.g., Braunwalder et ah, 1996). In such cases, the transfer of 33P04 from ATP to the synthetic substrates poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 or poiy(Arg, Ser) 3:1 attached to the bioaotive surface of miorotiter plates is taken as a measure of enzyme activity. After an incubation period, the amount of phosphate transferred is measured by first washing the plate with 0.5% phosphoric acid, adding liquid scintiilant, and then counting in a liquid scintillation detector. The IC5Q is determined by the concentration of compound that causes .a 50% reduction in the amount of 33r incorporated onto the substrate bound to the plate. ' In one method, the activated kinase is incubated with a biotinylated substrate peptide (containing tyr) with or without the presence of a compound of the invention. After the kinase-assay incubation period, excess kinase inhibitor is added to kili the kinase reaction along with Europium-labeled anfl'-phosphotyrosine antibody (Eu-Ab) and Allophycocyanin-Streptavidin (SA-APC). The biotinylated substrate peptide {with or without phosphorylated Tyrosine} in solution binds to the SA-AFG via Biotln-Avidin binding. The Eu-Ab binds only to substrate with phosphoryiated Sryrosine. When the solution is excited at 615nm, there is an energy transfer from the Europium to the AFC when they are in ciose proximity (i.e. attached to the same moiecuie of biotinylated and phosphorylated substrate peptide). The ARC then fluoresces at a wavelength of 8S5nm. Excitation and emission take place In a Wallac Victor* V plate reader where the plate is read fluorometricaliy and absorbances at 815 and 665nm are recorded. These data are then processed by an Excel plate processor which calculates !C5Gs of test compounds by converting the fluorescence into amounts of phosphorylated substrate made and determining the concentration attest compound that would be required to inhibit the development of phosphoryiated substrate by 50% (IC50). Other methods relying upon the transfer of phosphate to peptide or polypeptide substrate containing tyrosine, serine, threonine or histidine, alone, in combination with each other, or in combination with other amino acids, In solution or immobilized (i.e., solid phase) are also useful. For example, transfer of phosphate to a peptide or polypeptide cars also be detected using scintillation proximity, Fluorescence Polarization or homogeneous fime-resoived fluorescence, Alternatively, kinase activity can be measured using antibody-based methods in which an antibody or polypeptide is used as a reagent to detect phosphor/lsied target polypeptide. For additional background information on such assay methodologies, see e,.g,, Braunwaidereta!,, 1996, Anal, Biochem. 234(ΐ):23; Cleaveland et at., 1990, AnaiBiochem, 190(2):249 Gish et al. (1995), Protein Eng, 8(6):609 Kolb et al. (1998). Drug Disoov, Toda V, 3:333 Lehr et ai. (1998), Gene 169(2):27527 - 87 Seethala et al. (1998). Anal Blochem. 255(2):257 Wu et al. <2000). ICSQ values in the low nanomolar range have been observed for compounds of this Invention against various kinases, including Src, Abi and kdr. Ce!!~based assays Certain compounds of this invention have also been demonstrated cytotoxic or growth inhibitory effects on tumor and other cancer cell lines and thus may be useful in the treatment of cancer and other cell proliferative diseases. Compounds are assayed for anti-tumor activity using in yivo and in vitro assays which are well known to those skilled in the art. Generally. Initial screens of compounds to identify candidate anti-cancer drugs are performed in cellular assays, Compounds identified as having anti-proliferative activity In such cell-based assays can then be subsequently assayed in whole ofganisms for anti-tumor activity and toxicity. Generally speaking, cell-based screens can be performed more rapidly and cost-effectively relative to assays that use whole organisms. For purposes of ihls invention, the terms “anti-tumor1 and “anti-cancer" activity arc used interchangeably. Cell-based methods for measuring antiproliferative activity are well known and can be used for comparative characterisation of compounds of this invention, in genera!, cell proliferation and ceil viability assays are designed to provide a detectable signal when cells are meiaboiicaily active. Compounds may be tested for antiproliferative activity by measuring any observed decrease in metabolic activity of the ceils after exposure of the cells to compound. Commonly used methods include, for example, measurement of membrane integrity (as a measure of cel! viabiiUy)(e.g, using trypan blue exclusion) or measurement of DMA synthesis (e.g, by measuring incorporation of BrdU or 3H-ihymidine). Some methods for assaying ceil proliferation use a reagent ihat is converted Into a detectable compound during cel! proliferation. Particularly preferred compounds are tetrazolium salts and include without limitation ΜΤΤ (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazoi-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazollum bromide; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)- 2-{4-su!fbphenyl)-2H-tetrazolium), ΧΤΤ (2,3-bis(2-Methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl5-2H-tetrazoliufn-5.-carboxanllide)11 NT, ΝΒΤ, and NTV (Bernas etal. Bioehim Biophys Acta 1451(1):73-81, 19S9). Preferred assays utilising tetrazolium salts detect cel! proliferation by detecting the product of the enzymatic conversion of the tetrazolium salts Into blue formazan derivatives, which are readily detected by spectroscopic methods (Mosman. J. Immunol. Methods, 65:55-83,1983). Generally, preferred methods for assaying cel! proliferation involve incubating cells in ' a desired growth medium with and without the compounds to be tested, Growth conditions for various prokaryotic and eukaryotic oeiis are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art (Ausubeiet a!. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, VViiey and Sorts, 1999; Bonifacino et al. Current Protocols in Ceil Biology, Wiley and Sons, 1999 both incorporated herein by reference). To detect cell proliferation, the tetrazolium salts are added to the incubated cultured cells to allow enzymatic conversion to the detectable product by active cells. Cells are processed, and the optical density of the cells is determined to measure the amount of formazan derivatives. Furthermore, commercially available kits, including reagents and protocols, are avaiiabe for examples, from Promega Corporation (Madison, Wi), Sigma* Aldrich (St, Louis, MO), and Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). More specifically, the ceil proliferation assay we currently perform is using CeiiTiter 96 AGugous One Solution Cei! Proliferation assay kit (Promaga, Cat#G3581), This assay is a colorimetric method for determining the number of alive cells in proliferation or cytotoxicity assays, The assay utilizing terazoiium sails detect cell proliferation by detecting the product of the enzymatic conversion of the tetrazollum salts into blue formazan derivatives, which can be measured by the absorbance at 490 nm in a plate reader, Waiiac Victor2'/ (PerklnElmer). An example of cell-based assay is shown as below. The cell lines used in the assayare Ba/F3, a murine pro-B ceii line, which have been stably transfected with full-length wild-type Bcr-Ab! or Bcr-Abl with various kinase domain point mutations (including T351S, Y2.53F, Ε255Κ, Η396Ρ, Μ351Τ etc) constructs. Parental BafF3 cell line is used as control. These cell lines were obtained from Brian J. Darker (Howard Hughes Medical institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA). 8a/F3 ceil expressing Bcr-Abl or Bcr-Abl mutants were maintained in PRMI 1640 growth medium with 200 μΜ L-gultamlne, 10% PCS, penicillin {2QQU/mi), and streptomycin (200 pg/ml). Parental Ba/F3 cells were culture In the same medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml !L-3, Parents! Ba/F3 celis (supplemented with IL-3) or Ba/F3 ceils expressing WT or mutant Bcr-Abl are plated In duplicate at 1x104ce!is/wel! in 96-well plates with the compounds in different concentrations in the media. The compounds are first dissolved and diluted in DMSG by preparation of 4-fold dilution; next equal volumes of compounds with DMSC are transferred to medium and then transferred to ceil plates. The final compound concentrations start from 10 μΜ to 6 ηΜ. DMSO at same percentage is used as control. After compound was incubated with cells for 3 days, the numbers of active cells are measured using CeiiTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cel! Proliferation assay kit following the kit instruction. Basically, the tetrazollum salts are added to the incubated cultured cells to allow enzymatic conversion to the detectable product by active celis, Celis are processed, and the optical density of ihs cells Is determined to measure the amount of formazan derivatives, Mean +/- SD are generated from duplicated wells and reported as the percentage absorbance of control, ICSOg are calculated in best-fit curves using Mlcorsoft Excel-fit software, in addition, a wide variety of celt types may be used to screen compounds for antiproliferative activity, including the following cel! lines, among others: COLO 205 (colon cancer), DLD-1 (colon cancer), ΗΟΤ-1δ (colon cancer), ΗΤ2Θ (ooion cancer), HEP G2 (Hepatoma), K-562 (Leukemia), Α549 (Lung), NCI-H249 (Lung), MGF7 (Mammary). MQA-MB-231 (Mammary), SAQS-2 (Osteosarcoma), GVCAR-3 (Ovarian), PANG-1 (Pancreas), DU-145 (Prostate), PC-3 (Prostate), ACHN (Renal), CAKI-1 (Renal), MG-63 (Sarcoma). White the ceil line is preferably mammalian, lower order eukaryotic cells such as yeast may also be used to screen compounds, preferred mammalian cell lines are derived from humans, rats, mice, rabbits, monkeys, hamsters, and guinea pigs since cells iines from these organisms are well-studied and characterized:- However, others may be used as well, Suitable mammalian ceil lines are often derived from tumors. For example, the following tumor ceii-typas may be sources of ceils for culturing cells: melanoma, myeloid leukemia, carcinomas of the lung, breast, ovaries, colon, kidney, prostate, pancreas and testes), cardiomyooytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, lymphocytes (T-cell and Β cell), mast cells, eosinophils, vascular intimai cells, hepatocytes, leukocytes including mononuclear ieukocytes, stem cells such as haemopoetic, neural, skin, lung, kidney, liver and myocyte stem cells (for use In screening for differentiation and de-differentiation factors), osteoclasts, chondrocytes and other connective tissue cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes, iiver ceils, kidneycells, and adipocytes. Non-limiting examples of mammalian cells lines that have been widely used by researchers Include HeLa, Ν1Η/3Τ3, ΗΤ1080, CHO, COS-1, 293Τ, WI-3B and OV1/EBNA-1. Other cellular assays may be used which rely upon a reporter gene to detest metabolically active cells. Non-limiting examples of reporter gene expression systems include green fluorescent protein (GFP), and luciferase. As an example of the use of GFP to screen for potential antitumor drugs, Sandman et al, (Ghem Bioi. 8:541-61; Incorporated herein by reference) used HeLa cells containing an inducible variant of GFP to detect compounds lhat inhibited expression of the GFP, and thus inhibited cell proliferation. Compounds identified by such cellular assays as having anti-cell proliferation activity are then tested for anti-tumor activity in whole organisms. Preferably, the organisms are mammalian. Well-characterized mammalians systems for studying cancer include rodents such as rats and mice. Typically, a tumor of interest is transplanted into a mouse having a reduced ability to mount an immune response to the tumor to reduce the likelihood of rejection. Such mice Include for example, nude mice (athymic) and SOfD (severe combined Immunodeficiency) mice, Other transgenic mice such as oncogene containing mice may be used In the present assays (see for example USP 4,736,888 and USP 6,175,383), Fora review and discussion on the use of rodent models for antitumor drug tasting see Kerbel (Cancer Metastasis Rev. 17:301-304, 1898-89). In general, the tumors of interest are implanted in a test organism preferably subcutaneously, The organism containing the tumor Is treated with doses of candidate anti-tumor compounds. The size of the tumor Is periodically measured to determine the effects of the test compound on the tumor, Some tumor types are implanted at sites other than subcutaneous sites (e.g. Intraperitoneal sites) and survival is measured as the endpoint. Parameters to be assayed with routine screening include different tumor models, various tumor and drug routes, and dose amounts and schedule.
