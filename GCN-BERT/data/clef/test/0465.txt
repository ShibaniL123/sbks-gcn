DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring to FIGS. 1-4, an example tackling training device 10 has a generally T-shaped configuration. The training device 10 includes a primary pad 14, a first arm directing portion 20, a second arm directing portion 24, and a head directing portion 30. A forward facing area 36 of the primary pad 14 is vertically below the head directing portion 30. The head directing portion 30 extends forward from the primary pad 14, such that the forward facing area 36 is recessed relative to the head directing portion 30. The arm directing portions 20 and 24 extend laterally outward from opposing lateral sides 40 and 44 of the primary pad 14. The arm directing portions 20 and 24 are connected to the primary pad 14 vertically above the forward facing area 36. The arm directing portions 20 and 24 may partially or fully connect to the head directing portion 30 in some examples. The primary pad 14 has a generally rectangular cross sectional profile. The lateral sides 40 and 44 provide opposing sides of the rectangular profile. The forward facing area 36 completes another side of the rectangular profile. The training device 10 includes two of the arm directing portions 20 and 24. In another example, one, or some other number of arm directing portions, may be used. The arm directing portion 20 provides an aperture 50. The arm directing portion 24 also provides an aperture 54. The apertures 50 and 54 are rectangular. The apertures 50 and 54 have a height h and a width w. In this example, the height h is greater than the width w. The height h is about twice the width w in this example. The example apertures 50 and 54 are holes having their entire perimeter p defined by a portion of the training device 10. In another example, the apertures 50 and 54 are slots having only a portion of their perimeter p defined by the training device 10. For example, the laterally outermost portions of the arm directing portions 20 and 24 could be eliminated to provide a slot rather than the holes 50 and 54. The head directing portion 30 has a generally triangular profile pâ€². The head directing portion 30 extends from an apex 60 of the head directing portion 30 to a laterally enlarged base 64. The apex 60 faces away from the primary pad 14. The laterally enlarged base 64 is thus closer to the primary pad 14 than the apex 60. Some of the head directing portion 30 extends vertically above the apertures 50 and 54. Some of the head directing portion 30 extends vertically above the arm directing portions 20 and 24. Referring now to FIGS. 5-6A, during a training exercise, the training device 10 may be held by a coach or trainer 70. Hand holds (not shown) on the training device 10 may be engaged by the hands of the coach 70 to support the training device 10. In another example, the training device 10 is supported by a sled through an arm rather than a coach 70. In addition to being supported by hand or a sled, the training device 10 could be supported by some other way or placed directly on the ground. An athlete 80 utilizes the training device 10 during training. The training device 10 trains the athlete 80 to utilize a desired tackling technique when tackling another athlete during a game or practice. In this example, the desired tackling technique calls for the athlete 80 to maintain an inside hand position during a tackle and to move their head to a side during a tackle. Desired tackling technique also calls for the athlete 80 to wrap up the other athlete. The athlete 80 may practice tackling multiple times using the training device 10 in place of another athlete. During a practice tackle of the training device, the arm directing portions 20 and 24 help train the athlete 80 to maintain an inside hand position rather than wrapping wide and extending the tackler's hands 80 laterally outward. During the tackling training, the tackler's hands 84 move through the apertures 50 and 54. If the tackler's hands 84 do not move through the apertures 50 and 54, the athlete 80 will not be able to wrap the primary pad 14. When starting a properly executed practice tackle, the hands 84 enter the apertures 50 and 54. During the latter stages of the practice tackle (see FIG. 6), the tackler's hands 84 move through and past the apertures 50 and 54 such that a portion of the tackler's arm 88, and perhaps the tackler's upper arm, are positioned within the apertures 50 and 54. Extending the hands 84 and arm 88 through the apertures 50 and 54 enables the athlete 80 to wrap the primary pad 14. The apertures 50 and 54 are also positioned at an appropriate vertical height for a properly executed practice tackle. During a properly executed practice tackle, the tackler's head 92 is directed laterally away from a center of the primary pad 14. The head 92 interfaces first with the apex 60. The tapering of the head directing portion 30 toward the enlarged base 64 forces the head 92 to move laterally left or right. Training the head 92 to move laterally during a tackle teaches the athlete 80 to avoid leading with their head 92. The tackling training device 10 utilizes arm directing and head directing within a single training device 10. Other example pads may use one of these features. During a tackling he forward facing area 36 may interface with areas of a tackler other than the chest, such as the shoulder, during training. For example, referring to FIGS. 7-9, an example training device 100 utilizes arm directing portions 120 and 124, but does not utilize a head directing portion projecting forward from a primary pad. Referring now to FIGS. 10-12, yet another example training device 200 utilizes a head directing portion 230 but does not utilize a separate portion for directing a tackler's arms. Features of the disclosed examples include a tackling device utilized to teach proper tackling techniques to avoid injury. In one example, the training device directs a tackler's head laterally and a tackler's arms inward to encourage the tackler to maintain a crouched position during a tackle without leading with their head. 1.
