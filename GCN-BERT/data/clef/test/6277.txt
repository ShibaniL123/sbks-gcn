Preparation of trans-2,2-dichloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(2-(2,4-difluorobenzyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide (F2547)
To a solution of trans-2,2-dichloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(2-(2,4-difluorobenzylidene)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide (F3004) (0.20 g, 0.34 mmol) in ethanol (6 mL) were added acetic acid (0.1 mL) and sodium cyanoborohydride (0.107 g, 1.7 mmol) at 0° C. and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water (10 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×10 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography using 20-40% ethyl acetate/petroleum ether as eluent afforded the title compound as an off-white solid (0.155 g, 77%).
