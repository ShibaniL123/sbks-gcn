SPECIFICATION TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN Be it known that I, NILS ARVID PALMGREN, a subject of the Kingdom of Sweden, residing in Goteborg, Sweden, whose Post Office Address is Gibraltargatan 8, Goteborg, Sweden, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in RADIAL PLAIN BEARINGS FOR GREASE LUBRICATION of which the following is a Specification: This invention relates to grease lubricated plain bearings, and has for an object to provide within a bearing of this type a reservoir for containing a supply of consistent lubricant and means for automatically circulating such con¬ sistent lubricant toward and away from the sliding surface of the bearing. Another object of the invention is to provide a bearing comprising outer and inner bearing rings formed with mating sliding surfaces with a reservoir for containing a supply of consistent lubricant and provided with means contained within the rings for automatically circulating such consistent lubricant from the reservoir to the sliding surfaces within the bearing and from thence to the reservoir. Another object of the invention is to supply a plain radial bearing with side enclosures fitted in a lubricant proof manner to the outer ring of the bearing and rotatably sealing against parts of the inner ring lying on a smaller diameter than is the diameter of the sliding surface of such inner ring. Another object of the invention is to provide lubri¬ cant channels in the inner ring connecting its sliding surfaces to toe lubricant reservoir, the sides of such sliding surface being in communication with the reservoir. / y. Modern plain bearings made to comply with hydrodynamlc laws have hitherto exclusively been designed for oil lubrication. A consistent lubricant, however, offers very important advant¬ ages from a practical point of view, partly because a grease of suitable composition simultaneously acts as a lubricant and a protection against the intrusion of foreign particles into the bearing, and partly because a grease does not escape from the bearing housing, if the machine assumes different positions when running. . Grease lubricated bearings have been in use for a long time, but the bearing designs have not hitherto admitted the maintenance of fluid friction for any considerable time, without the aid of continually working auxiliary machines for providing a constant supply of lubricant. The present invention relates t o a bearing design ren¬ dering possible an automatic circulation of a consistent lubricant in a plain bearing, in that a surplus of grease is constantly sup¬ plied to the sliding surface from a grease chamber and reconveyed to this chamber after having lubricated the'sliding surface. The bearing comprises substantially an inner bearing ring, provided with a sliding surface on the outside, an outer bearing ring, on the inside of which is a sliding surface fitting the inner ring, and side discs fitted in a lubricant proof ' manner to the outer ring and rotatably sealing against parts of the inner ring which lie on a considerably smaller diameter than the sliding surface of the inner' ring, whereby the side discs and bearing rings are designed to form closure members for the lubricant, and lubricant channels are provided in the inner ring which connect the sliding surface of the closure members. - S - iv- "l r ( ' f The invention is illustrated in the accompanyIm&Sftr drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of a radial plain bearing for grease lubrication according to one embodiment of the invention. Figure 2 is a sectional view of the same bearing in an axial plane. Figure 5 is a side view of a bearing according to another embodiment of the invention, and Figure 4 is a section in an axial plane of the bear¬ ing according to Figure S. In Figures 1 and 2 the inner ring 1 is shown of rela¬ tively high I-form in cross section. On the outside of the outer flanges 2 and 3 of the inner ring is a cylindrical sliding sur¬ face. To this sliding surface fits a corresponding sliding surface, formed on the inside,of the outer ring 4. On the outer ring 4, two closure members 5, 6 are applied in such a manner that the' lubricant cannot pass between the members and the outer ring. The members 5, 6, extend inwardly toward the bearing center and have flanges 7, 8, which form movable seals against the outside of the inner flanges 9, 10 of the inner ring, there being a narrow space between the flanges 7, 8, of the closure members and the flanges 9, 10, of the inner ring. In the web 11 ofthe inner ring a number of holes 12 are formed, and holes 13 in the outer flange of the inner ring lead from the holes 12 to the sliding surface. The closure mem¬ bers which are of annular cup f orm with the bottoms outwards form a tight chamber or reservoir around the bearing rings, which in practice is filled with grease. This chamber communicates with the sliding surface through holes 12, 13 in the inner ring, and with the sides of the sliding surface for supply and exhaust respectively. I -rv <f> The grease chamber or reservoir enclosed between &5Hf)Qf%' bearing rings ana side discs is of annular form and is located nearer the bearing penter than is the sliding surface. The rota¬ tion of the inner ring causes part of the grease to follow the rotation of the ring and thereby to be pressed out through the holes 13 by the centrifugal force to the narrow space between the inner and outer ring, where a load carrying lubricant film is formed according to the hydrodynaralc laws. Owing to the | pressure in this film, the grease is gradually pressed out against the sides and returns automatically to the grease contain¬ ing chamber. The grease will consequently automatically circu¬ late under the action of the centrifugal force and the bearing | pressure, without ever having to leave the bearing. | . ' The bea»S according to Pigs. 3 and 4 is designed | ' in practically the àame manner as the bearing described above. | The sliding surface on the outside of the inner ring 1 is, I however, spherical and fits into a corresponding surface on tte | inside of the outer ring 4. The bearing is thereby self-aligning. The side discs 5, 6, are designed as deeper cups of annular form, so that the axial width over the bottoms of the side discs is greater than the axial width of the bearing rings. By this means . a considerably larger supply of lubricant is assured mtto bearing. In the bearing according to Figures 3 and 4, plane thrust talcing s liding surfaces are provided along the sides of the outer flanges 2, 3, They bear against pressure rings 14, 15, which are supported by the spherical sliding surface of the outer ring 4. These rings are located inside the grease olo. and do not disturb the desired grease circulation. ) sure 'v r 358,9.90 Having tïms described my invention, I claim and desire to secure "by Letters Patent: 1.
