A quantum dot, which is a semiconductor material of a nano size, exhibits quantum confinement effects. When the quantum dot receives light from an excitation source and reaches its energy excitation state, it releases energy according to its own given energy band gap. Also, since its electrical and optical properties can be adjusted by controlling the size of the quantum dot to adjust its given band gap, its emission wavelength can be easily controlled by merely controlling the size of the quantum dot, and since it shows excellent color purity and high luminous efficiency, it can be applied to various devices such as a light-emitting device or photoelectric conversion device. Previously developed quantum dots as a light-emitting device have poor dispersibility and stability in aqueous solutions and also show undesirable color purity and light-emitting properties so that they have difficulties in use as a light-emitting device, and steady researches for addressing these issues are going on.

The light-emitting quantum dot of the present invention is a quantum dot comprising a core/shell structure and a ligand which is attached to the surface of the shell, which is characterized in that the ligand comprises a light-emitting group. The ligand comprises a light-emitting group, and a linking group for connecting the light-emitting group and the shell, and if necessary, may include a spacer between the linking group and the light-emitting group. The following structural formula 1 shows a schematic diagram of a light-emitting quantum dot according to one embodiment of the present invention. In the above structural formula 1, A represents a light-emitting group, L represents a spacer, and X represents a linking group. In the present invention, the light-emitting groups may be each independently the same as or different from one another and they may emit the same color or two or more different colors at the same time. For the core/shell structure in the light-emitting quantum dot of the present invention, a known core/shell structure may be used and for example, a core/shell structure described in Korea Patent Application Publication No. 2010-35466 may be utilized. More particularly, the core/shell structure may be a substance selected from the group consisting of a) a first element selected from Group 2, Group 12, Group 13 and Group 14, and a second element selected from Group 16; b) a first element selected from Group 13, and a second element selected from Group 15; and c) an element of Group 14, or a core/shell structure formed therefrom and for example, there can be used at least one selected from the group consisting of MgO, MgS, MgSe, MgTe, CaO, CaS, CaSe, CaTe, SrO, SrS, SrSe, SrTe, BaO, BaS, BaSe, BaTE, ZnO, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, CdO, CdS, CdSe, CdTe, HgO, HgS, HgSe, HgTe, Al2O3, Al2S3, Al2Se3, Al2Te3, Ga2O3, Ga2S3, Ga2Se3, Ga2Te3, In2O3, In2S3, In2Se3, In2Te3, SiO2, GeO2, SnO2, SnS, SnSe, SnTe, PbO, PbO2, PbS, PbSe, PbTe, AlN, AlP, AlAs, AlSb, GaN, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InN, InP, InAs, InSb, BP, Si, and Ge, or a structure in a core/shell shape formed therefrom. The average diameter of the above core/shell structure can be optionally controlled, and those of 1-12 nm may be used. Preferably, the core/shell structure for emitting light in the region of 500 to 800 nm may have a diameter of 5-12 nm, and the core/shell structure for emitting light in the region of 400 to 500 nm may have a diameter of 1-3 nm. In addition, for the light-emitting group in the light-emitting quantum dot of the present invention, a group for emitting light between 400 and 800 nm can be applied. For the light-emitting group, a known light-emitting group may be used and for example, fluorescent or phosphorescent light-emitting group may be used. More particularly, the light-emitting group may be any one of FL1 to FL38, or PL1 to PL59. In the following FL1 to FL38, or PL1 to PL59, * is a connection portion wherein the connection portion may be connected to at least one of the substitution positions in parentheses, and R1 to R16 are each independently hydrogen; deuterium; halogen; an amino group; a nitrile group; a nitro group; an alkyl group of C1-C40; an alkenyl group of C2-C40; an alkoxy group of C1-C40; a cycloalkyl group of C3-C40; a heterocycloalkyl group of C3-C40; an aryl group of C6-C40; a heteroaryl group of C3-C40; an aralkyl group of C3-C40; an aryloxy group of C3-C40; an arylthio group of C3-C40 optionally substituted with deuterium, halogen, an amino group, a nitrile group or a nitro group; or Si. Optionally, two or more selected from R1 to R16 may be bonded to one another to form a ring, and S, N, O, or Si may be included. In addition, the above linking group in the light-emitting quantum dot of the present invention is not particularly limited to a specific one as long as it can be connected to a light-emitting group or a spacer while being attached to the shell and for example, there can be used one or more groups selected from the group consisting of a thiol group, carboxy group, amine group, phosphine group and phosphide. Preferably, the linking group is a thiol. Also, the light-emitting quantum dot of the present invention may further a spacer between the light-emitting group and the linking group. The spacer may expand the number of light-emitting groups capable of being attached to the core/shell structure, facilitate the dispersion of the ligand containing the light-emitting material in a solvent during the preparation of the light-emitting quantum dot, and block energy transfer to contribute to the achievement of high purity white color. Specifically, the spacer may be a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group of C1-C30, cycloalkyl group of C3-C40, or silane of Si1-Si30, but not be limited thereto. Preferably, the light-emitting quantum dot of the present invention may comprise the light-emitting group, the spacer, and the linking group altogether, and for example, it may have structures shown below. In the following structures, a portion H in â€”SH, COOH, and NH is a portion for binding to the core/shell structure. The size of the entire light-emitting quantum dot including the light-emitting group at its end in the present invention may be optionally adjusted and preferably, it may be 5 to 30 nm, more preferably 10-20 nm. Further, the luminescence strength of the core/shell structure and the light-emitting group in the present invention is optionally adjustable and preferably, when the core/shell structure and the light-emitting group in the invention are complementary colors, the difference of the luminescence intensity ratio of the core/shell structure and the light-emitting group may be preferably within 30% as a white light source. For example, when the luminescence intensity in the region of 400 to 500 nm is one, the luminescence intensity in the region of 500 to 800 nm may be preferably 0.7-1.3, and when the luminescence intensity in the region of 500 to 800 nm is one, the luminescence intensity in the region of 400 and 500 nm may be preferably 0.7-1.3. The following structural formula 2 illustrates a schematic diagram of a light-emitting quantum dot according to a specific embodiment of the present invention, in which the light-emitting material emits light in the region of 400 to 500 nm, and the core/shell structure may be a known quantum dot. The light-emitting quantum dot according to the present invention may be prepared by a method comprising adding a ligand containing a light-emitting group to a solvent dispersed with a core/shell structure and then stirring it. For the preparation of the core/shell structure in the above, a known method may be used and in particular, the synthesis method described in FIG. 1 may be carried out. Also, the preparation of the ligand containing the light-emitting group may be carried out by binding a linking group to the light-emitting group, or by including a spacer between the light-emitting group and the linking group via the following reaction formulae 1 and 2. Specifically, the above reaction formula 2 may be reaction formula 3. In the above reaction formulae, A, L, and X are as defined in structural formula 1. Further, in the method of attaching the ligand containing the light-emitting group to the core/shell structure, the stirring process may be performed at a temperature from a room temperature to 100Â° C. for 0.1 to 100 hours. In another aspect, the present invention provides a light-emitting device (QLED) and a method for the preparation thereof using the above light-emitting quantum dot.

In addition, if necessary, a hole blocking layer may be further included between the electron transport layer and the light-emitting layer, and a buffer layer may be formed between layers. The light-emitting device (QLED) using the light-emitting quantum dot in the present invention can be formed by a conventional manufacturing method and the thickness of each organic film including the light-emitting layer may be made to be 30 to 100 nm.
