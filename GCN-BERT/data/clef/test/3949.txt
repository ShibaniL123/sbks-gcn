The Government has certain rights in this invention. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to multi-dimensional cardiac imaging methods and systems. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction remains one of the most important cardiac diseases for which current noninvasive diagnostic techniques remain inadequate. For instance, more than 60% of women admitted for congestive heart failure have diastolic dysfunction as the cause of their symptoms. However, current noninvasive diagnostic criteria (primarily utilizing echocardiography) are able to reliably classify only 60-70% of the patients. Central to the idea of diastolic dysfunction is the alteration of the pressure-volume relationship of the left ventricle. This relationship is best evaluated under dynamic changes in the ventricular loading condition e.g. while the patient is breathing. Fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have enabled the acquisition of volumetric datasets within a patient-tolerable examination time. However, many patient datasets are “corrupted” by dynamic physiologic motion. Much of the research in volumetric data acquisition has been aimed at removing these dynamic effects. The present invention takes a different approach and provides a method and system to acquire and display the effect of these dynamic physiologic changes (either spontaneous or induced) on cardiac function to elucidate their effects on diastolic myocardial function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a 5-dimensional imaging method and system to acquire and display the effect of dynamic physiologic changes (either spontaneous or induced) on cardiac function of a patient's heart to elucidate their effects on diastolic myocardial function: In a patient free-breathing magnetic resonance imaging study of said patient's heart, a computer system is used to acquire 3-dimensional spatial information and concurrently acquires recordings of cardiac and respiratory cycles of the patient. The 3-dimensional spatial information is sampled with a non-Cartesian 3-dimensional k-space readout trajectory which is incorporated into a magnetic resonance imaging sequence. The magnetic resonance imaging sequence could utilize principles of free-induction decay, steady-state free precession, gradient echo, spin echo, magnetization preparation modules, or a combination thereof to prepare image contrast from the magnetic resonant spins. The non-Cartesian 3-dimensional k-space readout trajectory traverses data points along arbitrary trajectories instead of straight rectilinear line trajectories common in Cartesian sampling. Examples of traversing data points could be along intersecting diagonal line trajectories, spiraling trajectories, circular trajectories in 3D k-space, or a combination thereof. Compared to traditional rectilinear Cartesian sampling, the non-Cartesian sampling provides higher scan acceleration (e.g., 3- to 8-fold or higher), improves robustness to motion/flow effects (incoherent instead of coherent artifacts) and provides robustness to missing data points in k-space. The acquisition typically includes a plurality of segments of a plurality of readouts and each segment is repeated multiple times to cover at least a full period of a cardiac and respiratory cycle of the patient. All segments are acquired to cover the full set of readouts. For each cardiac and respiratory temporal phase combination in the recorded cycles, the computer system further calculates and displays 3-dimensional volumetric measurements of the atria and ventricles of the patient's heart and the rate of change of these measured volumes with respect to the cardiac and respiratory cycles. The non-Cartesian 3-dimensional k-space readout trajectory could be a non-Cartesian 3-dimensional cones k-space readout trajectory, a non-Cartesian 3-dimensional echo-planar imaging (EPI) k-space readout trajectory, non-Cartesian 3D Periodically Rotated Overlapping ParallEL Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction (PROPELLER) k-space readout trajectory, non-Cartesian 3D stack of spirals k-space readout trajectory, non-Cartesian 3D stack of rings k-space readout trajectory, or a non-Cartesian 3-dimensional projection reconstruction (PR) k-space readout trajectory, or other rapid 3D k-space readout trajectory. In one embodiment the acquisition of 3-dimensional spatial information is enhanced with MRI acceleration techniques including, but not limited to, parallel imaging, spatiotemporal undersampling and reconstruction, or compressed sensing. In another embodiment, the 3-dimensional spatial information and respiratory and cardiac information could be complemented with flow information, perfusion information or a combination thereof. In still another embodiment, the 3-dimensional spatial information and respiratory and cardiac information could be complemented with MRI T1-relaxation information, MRI T2-relaxation information, or a combination thereof. In still another embodiment, the 3-dimensional spatial information and respiratory and cardiac information could be complemented with oxygenation level information, the distribution of an administered contrast agent or a combination thereof. In yet another embodiment, the study could further include internally or externally induced respiratory pressure variations to the patient. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows a 3D cones k-space trajectory according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 shows a sample interleaved k-space acquisition segment including 10 cone readouts. Note the pairing of adjacent readouts according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. FIG. 3 shows a steady-state free precession (SSFP) cones imaging sequence according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4 shows according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention the respiratory phase (RespPh) and cardiac phase (CardPh) of each readout which are retrospectively determined from the recorded physiologic signals (e.g., bellows for respiratory, motion and pulse-ox plethysmograph for cardiac motion). Acquired data are then re-ordered and reconstructed to obtain a 5D matrix. FIGS. 5A-C according to examples of the invention (A) shows 10 slices (sl1-sl10) at end diastole and end expiration from a healthy volunteer acquired during a baseline free-breathing 5D scan (B) shows the first 5 resolved respiratory phases of the central slice at end diastole from a baseline free-breathing 5D scan. (C) shows the first 5 resolved respiratory phases of the matching slice at end diastole during a free-breathing scan modulated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device set to 15 cm-H2O. The diaphragm is at a lower position due to increased intra-thoracic pressure and the volume of the left ventricle is reduced. DETAILED DESCRIPTION A 5-dimensional (5D) representation of the heart, including 3D spatial information, 1D cardiac phase information, and 1D respiratory phase information, is acquired during a free-breathing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Additional dimensions of information, such as perfusion or flow, can augment this 5D acquisition. Data Acquisition 1. A non-Cartesian 3D cones k-space readout trajectory is used to acquire volumetric MRI data (FIG. 1). The desired spatial field of view (FOV) and spatial resolution are used to calculate the 3D cones trajectory. Compared to traditional rectilinear Cartesian sampling, the 3D cones provide scan acceleration (3- to 8-fold or higher), improve robustness to motion/flow effects (incoherent instead of coherent artifacts) and provide robustness to missing data points in k-space. In Cartesian sampling the desired data points in k-space correspond directly to a rectilinear Cartesian grid, with data points acquired along a single straight line in k-space after each MR signal excitation and the full set of data points acquired with multiple lines (excitations). In non-Cartesian sampling data points in k-space are not constrained to a rectilinear Cartesian grid, with data points acquired along arbitrary paths/trajectories in k-space after each MR signal excitation and the full set of data points acquired with multiple arbitrary paths (excitations). As more k-space data points can be acquired along an arbitrary trajectory (e.g., a circular or spiraling path), fewer excitations are required and overall scan time is reduced compared to acquisition with only straight Cartesian lines. Non-Cartesian sampling also avoids coherent ghosting artifacts in the reconstructed image when data points are missing (seen in Cartesian sampling). Furthermore, non-Cartesian trajectories can be designed to take advantage of the varying signal characteristics in k-space and improve MR image quality through enhancement of contrast or minimization of motion/flow effects.] 2. The 3D cones k-space trajectory is incorporated into a steady-state free precession (SSFP) imaging sequence (FIG. 3). The full set of 3D cone readouts (e.g., 300 readouts) is organized into several segments (e.g., 10 readouts/segment and 30 segments) and acquired over multiple cardiac and respiratory cycles (FIG. 2). Segmentation can be either sequential or interleaved and improves the temporal resolution of the acquisition. Pairing or grouping of readouts may be done for each segment to mitigate eddy current artifacts. Each segment is acquired multiple times to cover at least one full period of the cardiac and respiratory cycles before going on to acquire the next segment. This is repeated until all segments (and thus readouts) have been acquired. 3. Data acquisition is performed continuously throughout a scan and not prospectively gated to any physiologic signal. Physiologic signals (e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse-oximeter plethysmograph, respiratory bellows, navigators, or self-navigation information, etc.) are monitored and recorded concurrently for retrospective data re-ordering (FIG. 4). Data Reconstruction 4. After concluding data acquisition, the physiologic signals are synchronized to the imaging readouts (e.g., via timestamps) and used to determine the cardiac phase (CardPh) and respiratory phase (RespPh) of each readout. This can be accomplished, for example, by looking at the relative temporal position of a readout in the local cardiac and respiratory cycles (FIG. 4). 5. The number of cardiac phases (NCardPh) and respiratory phases (NRespPh) to reconstruct is determined. For example, NRespPh=(TRespAvg/TCardAvg) and NCardPh=(TCardAvg/TSeg), where TRespAvg is the average respiratory cycle duration, TCardAvg is the average cardiac cycle duration, and TSeg is the duration of one acquisition segment. 6. Data is then re-ordered into a 5D data matrix. Repeated acquisitions of the same entry in this matrix could be averaged. Missing data entries are estimated from neighboring points, where the last/first phases are considered neighbors (assuming periodic motion). Estimation can be simple nearest-neighbor interpolation or more sophisticated multipoint spatiotemporal interpolation. 7. For each (CardPh, RespPh) combination, a volume is reconstructed by 3D re-gridding followed by a regular 3D Fourier transform. Data from multiple receiver channels are combined (e.g., using a root of sum of squares). Data Analysis and Display 8. Volume measurements of the atria and ventricles and the rate of change of these volumes could be performed manually, semi-automatically, or automatically, and plotted with respect to the cardiac and/or respiratory cycles. Variations and/or Other Embodiments Multiple rapid MRI acquisition strategies could be used in combination to sample the multiple dimensions of anatomic and physiologic information, including advanced time-efficient non-rectilinear sampling methods (e.g. 3D cones, 3D stack-of-rings), motion-robust and contrast-enhancing acquisition scheduling, parallel imaging acceleration, spatiotemporal undersampling acceleration (e.g. k-t BLAST), compressed sensing theory (e.g. robust algorithms to reconstruct from sparse measurements), and other approaches exploiting a priori information. Automated, semi-automated, or manual determination could be performed of anatomic measurements and functional information from the acquired multi-dimensional dataset. For example, volume measurements of the atria and ventricles as calculated from the 3D morphology and the rate of change of the measured volumes with respect to cardiac and/or respiratory motion. Integrated visualization of the anatomic, physiologic, and derived measurements is established. This includes, but is not limited to, volume/surface rendering of the 3D morphology displayed as a temporal sequence with respect to cardiac and/or respiratory motion, plotting the derived measurements with respect to cardiac and/or respiratory motion, and perfusion and flow measurements overlaid on the 3D temporal sequence. Tests based on the described technique could be performed where external or internal agents can be activated to alter the physiologic state of the subject and the differences are documented and observed. Repeated applications of the technique over a prolonged duration of time can also be performed to characterize inherent variations in the resting physiologic state of the subject. EXAMPLE 1.

Characterization of functional information, such as flow and perfusion, and correlate the results with the underlying 3D morphology and physiologic motion. 4. Characterization of the distribution of a contrast agent and correlate the results with the underlying 3D morphology and physiologic motion (e.g., time-resolved volumetric imaging of myocardial scarring or general tumor physiology). 5. Observation of changes in the state of the heart over time or when under different conditions. Embodiments of the invention have several advantages of prior solutions and techniques. For example: 1. Rapid acquisition of multiple-dimensions of information effectively resolves the sources of physiologic motion and avoids artifacts arising from such motion. 2. Anatomic and physiologic information are co-registered. 3. The heart can be observed in its natural physiologic state. 4. Ease of use. No respiratory cooperation is expected from the patient. 5. Ease of prescription. Can prescribe coverage over whole heart with isotropic resolution. 6. The comprehensive multi-dimensional acquisition allows for flexible repeated inspection of a plurality of information retrospectively. Embodiments of the invention can be varied. For example: 1. The imaging modality can be different from MRI and use different contrast mechanisms, such as 3D X-ray computed tomography (CT) or 3D echocardiography. 2. Additional functional information can be acquired in the multi-dimensional acquisition (see also point 10 and 11). 3. Imaging contrast agents can be administered. 4. The imaging region of interest can be extended beyond the heart. 5. The imaging subject can also be non-human. 6. This 5D MRI technique can be performed with induced respiratory pressure variations, such as by using a respiratory mask connected to a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, to study the cardiac pressure-volume relationship in different disease states (including diastolic dysfunction). 7. The implementation can be based on other imaging sequences besides SSFP, such as spin echo, fast spin echo, gradient echo, or radio-frequency-spoiled gradient echo. 8. The volumetric reconstruction can employ a non-uniform fast Fourier transform instead of 3D re-gridding and a regular Fourier transform. 9. Additional acceleration can be achieved by parallel imaging reconstruction, constrained spatiotemporal reconstruction, or compressed sensing reconstruction. 10. This 5D MRI technique can be augmented to acquire additional dimensions of information, such as perfusion or flow. 11. MRI has a distinct advantage in offering multiple contrast mechanisms for obtaining anatomic and functional information (including T1 weighting, T2 weighting, proton-density weighting, flow, oxygenation level, diffusion, chemical shift, the distribution of an imaging agent, etc.), which can all be considered in this invention to provide a multi-dimensional view of the human heart or other regions of interest.
