Preparation Example 5: Preparation of tert-butyl 6-((2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-2-azaspiro[3.3]h eptane-2-carboxylate
(2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid (3.77 g, 13.6 mmol) and tert-butyl 6-amino-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptane-2-carboxylate (2.9 g, 13.7 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL), cooled to 0°C under protection of nitrogen gas, to which 1-hydroxylbenzotriazole (2.76 g, 20.4 mmol), triethylamine (3.16 g, 31.3 mmol) and 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (3.91 g, 20.4 mmol) were added, and the reaction solution was heated to 25°C and stirred for 16 h. After completion of the reaction as measured by LC-MS, water (100 mL) and dichloromethane (100 mL) were added, after the phases were separated, the organic phase was concentrate, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate = 4:1 to 1:1) to obtain the title compound (4.5 g, yield 70.3%).
