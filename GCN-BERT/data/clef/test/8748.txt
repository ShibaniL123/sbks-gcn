6-(2-chloroacetyl)chroman-2-one (0.283 g, 1.26 mmol) and thiourea (0.101 g, 1.32 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (10 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 80° C. for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with trimethylamine (1 mL), extracted with ethyl acetate (2×200 mL) and washed with sat. NaHCO3 (2×50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)chroman-2-one (0.26 g, 84%) as a tan solid.
