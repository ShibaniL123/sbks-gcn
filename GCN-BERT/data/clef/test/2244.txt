ORAL FORMULATIONS OF KINASE INHIBITORS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the priority of U.S. provisional application Serial Number 61/359,694, filed June 29, 2010, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BACKGROUND Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. Small-molecule inhibitors of various classes of kinases have become significant exploratory medicinal compounds. However, certain kinase inhibitors possess properties of low water solubility and poor oral bioavailability. Among the various classes of kinases for which experimental small-molecule inhibitors have been developed are the family known as Focal Adhesion Kinase. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has recently been established as a key component of the signal transduction pathways triggered by integrins. Aggregation of FAK with integrins and cytoskeletal proteins in focal contacts has been proposed to be responsible for FAK activation. Recent results from a number of different approaches have shown that integrin signaling through FAK leads to increased cell migration on fibronectin as well as potentially regulating cell proliferation and survival. JL Guan (1997 Aug-Sep), Int J BiochemCell Biol., 29(8-9): 1085-96. Interaction with integrin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) regulates the cancer cell adhesion and invasion into extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, phosphorylation of FAK correlates with the increase of cell motility and invasion. Adhesion and spreading of cancer cells on a variety of ECM proteins, including collagen type IV, leads to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK. Η Sawai, et al. (2005), Molecular Cancer, 4:37. Certain compounds of the 2,4-diaminopyridine class of inhibitors show promise in the treatment of malconditions that may be affected by FAK, such as proliferative disorders such as cancer and inflammatory disorders such as arthritis. See, for example, published PCT application W02008/115369, wherein compounds of this type are disclosed. For effective therapeutic use, such compounds must be formulated to provide adequate pharmacokinetic properties, such as AUC. Oral administration of compounds is generally preferred by the patient population, so oral formulations providing favorable pharmacokinetics are needed. SUMMARY The invention is directed to formulations of kinase inhibitors, such as small molecule inhibitors of Focal Adhesion Kinase, adapted for oral administration to patients. In various embodiments, the oral formulations are self-emulsifying formulations adapted to provide favorable pharmacokinetic properties for compound often of limited water solubility. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided an oral formulation for administration of a kinase inhibitor of the formula or any pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, comprising about 2 wt% to about 5 wt% of the kinase inhibitor, about 35 to 50 wt% of a glyceryl caprate / caprylate ester, about 20 to 40 wt% of a lecithin, about 15 to 30 wt% of an alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate, and up to about 10% PEG 400. In various embodiments, the invention provides an oral formulation for administration of a kinase inhibitor, comprising (a) the kinase inhibitor in pharmaceutically acceptable form; (b) an oil; (c) a solubilizer; and (d) a surfactant. In various embodiments, the invention provides a method for treatment of a malcondition in a patient wherein inhibition of a kinase is medically indicated, comprising orally administering to the patient an effective amount the formulation of the invention in a dose, at a frequency and for a duration of time to provide a beneficial effect to the patient. In various embodiments, the invention provides a method of preparing the formulation of the invention, comprising combining the kinase inhibitor and the solubilizing agent and, optionally, an organic solvent, then combining with the oil and the surfactant. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words “comprise”, “comprising”, and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of “including, but not limited to”. The term "about" as used herein, when referring to a numerical value or range, allows for a degree of variability in the value or range, for example, within 10%, or within 5% of a stated value or of a stated limit of a range. As used herein, "individual" (as in the subject of the treatment) means both mammals and non-mammals. Mammals include, for example, humans; non-human primates, e.g. apes and monkeys; and non-primates, e.g. dogs, cats, cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. Non-mammals include, for example, fish and birds. The term "disease" or "disorder" or "malcondition" are used interchangeably, and are used to refer to diseases or conditions wherein Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) plays a role in the biochemical mechanisms involved in the disease or malcondition such that a therapeutically beneficial effect can be achieved by acting on the kinase. "Acting on" FAK can include binding to FAK and/or inhibiting the bioactivity of FAK. “Administering” or “administration” refers to providing a medicinal compound to a patient in need thereof. A “dose” is the amount of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), in this case picoplatin, that is provided in a single administration. A “frequency” of administration refers to how often the medication is given when repeated doses are prescribed; for example, the medication can be administered daily. A “duration” refers to the period of time over which repeated doses are administered; for example, the picoplatin can be administered for a duration of two weeks. The expression “effective amount”, when used to describe therapy to an individual suffering from a disorder, refers to the amount of a compound of the invention that is effective to inhibit or otherwise act on FAK in the individual's tissues wherein FAK involved in the disorder is active, wherein such inhibition or other action occurs to an extent sufficient to produce a beneficial therapeutic effect. "Substantially" as the term is used herein means completely or almost completely; for example, a composition that is "substantially free" of a component either has none of the component or contains such a trace amount that any relevant functional property of the composition is unaffected by the presence of the trace amount, or a compound is "substantially pure" is there are only negligible traces of impurities present. “Treating” or "treatment" within the meaning herein refers to an alleviation of symptoms associated with a disorder or disease, or inhibition of further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or prevention or prophylaxis of the disease or disorder, or curing the disease or disorder. Similarly, as used herein, an “effective amount” or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound of the invention refers to an amount of the compound that alleviates, in whole or in part, symptoms associated with the disorder or condition, or halts or slows further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or prevents or provides prophylaxis for the disorder or condition. In particular, a "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of compounds of the invention are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A “formulation” as the term is used herein is a composition of matter including picoplatin and other components, such as excipients, stabilizers, dispersants, surfactants, and the like. “Self-emulsifying” refers to a property of a formulation wherein upon contacting the formulation with an aqueous medium, such as in the gastro-intestinal tract of a patient, the formulation spontaneously forms an emulsion. An “oil” as the term is used herein refers to an organic liquid, which is water-insoluble, or at least only partially water-soluble, that can form a separate phase in the presence of water. An example of an “oil” is a glyceride such as a medium chain triglyceride, or a medium chain mono- or di-glyceride, or castor oil. Another example of an oil is a fatty ester. A fatty ester refers to an alkyl ester of a fatty acid. An example is ethyl oleate. “MCT oil” refers to medium chain triglyceride oil. Examples include the MCT oil sold under the Miglyol trademark, such as Miglyol 912, a caprylate/caprate ( octanoate/decanoate triglyceride). “Miglyol 812” (Sasol Germany GmbH, Witten, Germany) refers to a medium chain triglyceride wherein the acid moieties are caprylic and capric acid. Miglyol is a trademark identifying the source of this and other varieties of MCT oil. “Capmul MCM” is a glyceryl caprate / caprylate ester. “Labrafil Μ 2125” is a linoleoyl PEG-glyceride, i.e., a linoleic ester of PEG-ylated glycerol. A “surfactant” as the term is used herein is a substance that reduces interfacial surface tension between immiscible liquids such as oil and water, reduces surface tension of a water drop, and exhibits other surface-active properties as are well known in the art. Surfactants are also known as “emulsifiers.” The term “weight average molecular weight” is well known in the art and characterizes an average molecular weight of a polydisperse sample of a polymer. A “PEG” or a “polyethyleneglycol” is a polymeric material composed of repeating -CH2CH2O- units, wherein there are two or more units. Thus, diethyleneglycol and all higher polymers are polyethyleneglycols within the meaning herein. A polyethyleneglycol can have a free OH group at either terminus or at both termini, or can alternatively include other groups such as an ether group at one or both ends, for example a dimethyl ether CH30-(CH2CH20)n-0CH3 or a monomethyl ether CH30-(CH2CH20)n-0H. Such an ether-terminated PEG can also be referred to as a “polyethyleneglycol ether”. PEG-400 is a PEG with a weight average molecular weight of about 400 DA. PEG-8000 is a PEG with a weight average molecular weight of about 8000 DA. A compound can be “PEG-ylated”, meaning that it bears at least one PEG group, which can be introduced in a variety of ways, such as by polymerization of ethylene glycol initiated by the compound, or coupling of the compound with a preformed PEG. “Polysorbate 80” refers to sorbitan mono-9-octadecanoate poly(oxy-l,2-ethanediyl) derivatives; they are well known as complex mixtures of polyoxyethylene ethers used as emulsifiers or dispersing agents in pharmaceuticals. “Sodium Lauryl Sulfate” is sodium dodecyl sulfate, a well known commercially available surfactant. “Phospholipon 90G” or “PL90G” (American Lecithin Products, Oxford, CT) is a tradename for lecithin, minimum 94% phosphatidylcholine for the manufacture of liposomes. “Phospholipon 90H” or “PL90H” is a hydrogenated PL90G.
