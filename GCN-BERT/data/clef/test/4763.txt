TECHNICAL FIELD Cross-Reference to Related Application This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-230673, filed on Oct. 18, 2012, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention mainly relates to a novel salty taste-enhancing agent and production method therefor, and salty taste-enhancing method for a food and beverage. The present invention also relates to a food additive, a seasoning, and a food and beverage. BACKGROUND ART Sodium is an essential mineral for a living organism, and salt (sodium chloride) is an extremely important substance as a source of sodium intake. A sodium ion contributes to, for example, maintenance of an extracellular fluid volume, regulation of osmotic pressure and acid-base equilibrium, neurotransmission, and formation of a membrane potential involved in transmembrane active transport of a substance, and thus is indispensable for life maintenance. However, in order to improve food palatability, salt intake tends to become excessive. For example, goal salt intakes proposed by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan are less than 9.0 g per day for adult human males and less than 7.5 g per day for adult human females (“Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2010 edition)” (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare)). In addition, a goal salt intake proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) is less than 6.0 g per day (“Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2010 edition)” (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare)) On the other hand, actual salt intakes for Japanese are 11.6 g per day for adult human males and 9.9 g per day for adult human females. Thus, there are huge gaps between the actual intakes and the goal values (“National Health and Nutrition Survey, 2009” (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare)). It has been pointed out that such excessive salt intake may serve as a cause for an increase in blood pressure, and it has been feared that the increase in blood pressure may cause cerebral stroke and heart diseases. Under such circumstances, there is a strong demand for a salt alternative or salty taste-enhancing agent, which, like salt, can impart a salty taste to a food, as one means for achieving a reduced salt intake. The salt alternative refers to a material that may be used in place of salt and exhibits a salty taste by itself. As the salt alternative, potassium chloride is known (Patent Literature 1). However, potassium chloride exhibits a bitter taste in addition to the salty taste, and hence reduces food palatability. In addition, excessive potassium intake is physiologically inconvenient. As the salty taste-enhancing agent, there is given an ingredient that has substantially no salty taste in itself but allows a salty taste of salt (sodium chloride) to be strongly sensed when used in combination with the salt. Various salty taste-enhancing agents have been proposed heretofore. Under the present circumstances, however, additional improvements have been demanded in terms of strength of a salty taste-enhancing effect.

Advantageous Effects of Invention According to one embodiment of the present invention, the novel salty taste-enhancing agent is provided. The salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention has a high salty taste-enhancing effect and has no salty taste and no foreign taste and foreign odor other than the salty taste in itself. Therefore, for example, the addition of the salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention as a food additive, a seasoning, or the like to salt can provide a food having a reduced salt content while having a salty taste with high palatability. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS 1. Salty Taste-Enhancing Agent The present invention relates to a salty taste-enhancing agent. Herein, the salty taste-enhancing agent refers to a substance that has substantially no salty taste in itself but allows a salty taste of salt (sodium chloride) to be strongly sensed when used in combination with the salt. Specific examples thereof include: a substance having an effect of allowing a subthreshold salty taste of a salty taste substance, which has been unable to be sensed, to be sensed when allowed to coexist with the salty taste substance; and a substance having an effect of inducing a strong salty taste through its addition. A salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention includes a compound represented by the following general formula (1) or a salt thereof. [In the formula, R represents: (i) a linear or branched hydrocarbon group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms that may be interrupted by a heteroatom, in which the hydrocarbon group may have at least one group selected from the group consisting of a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group; or (ii) a hydrogen atom.] The compound represented by the general formula (1) is a compound having a guanidino group, or guanidine. The hydrocarbon group may be a saturated hydrocarbon group, or may be an unsaturated hydrocarbon group. A specific example of the linear or branched hydrocarbon group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms in the case of not being interrupted by a heteroatom is an alkyl group such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, a n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, a sec-butyl group, a tert-butyl group, a n-pentyl group, an isopentyl(3-methylbutyl) group, a neo-pentyl(2,2-dimethylpropyl) group, a 1-methylbutyl group, a 2-methylbutyl group, a 1-ethylpropyl group, a 1,1-dimethylpropyl group, or a 1,2-dimethylpropyl group. When the hydrocarbon group is interrupted by a heteroatom, there is given, for example, a hydrocarbon group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms in which a carbon skeleton of the alkyl group is interrupted by one or more, preferably one heteroatom. Specific examples of the heteroatom include an oxygen atom and a sulfur atom. The heteroatom is preferably an oxygen atom. The hydrocarbon group may have at least one group selected from the group consisting of a carboxyl group and a hydroxyl group. When the hydrocarbon group has two or more groups, the groups may be identical to or different from each other. Specific examples thereof include, but not limited to, aspects such as an aspect having one carboxyl group, an aspect having one hydroxyl group, an aspect having a total of two groups, i.e., one carboxyl group and one hydroxyl group, an aspect having two carboxyl groups, and an aspect having two hydroxyl groups. An aspect having one or two hydroxyl groups is given as a preferred aspect from the viewpoint that the salty taste-enhancing effect is particularly high. When the compound represented by the general formula (1) has an asymmetric carbon atom, the compound may contain an R isomer, an S isomer, or a mixture thereof at any ratio, or may be a racemic mixture. The compound of the present invention, when having two or more asymmetric carbon atoms, may be any one of the isomers or a mixture thereof. The salt of the compound is not particularly limited as long as the salt does not affect the salty taste-enhancing effect. In addition, it is preferred that the salt impart no foreign taste and foreign odor. Examples of such salt include salts of organic acids and salts of inorganic acids. Of those, inorganic acids are preferred, and a hydrochloride is particularly preferred. A preferred aspect of the salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention is exemplified by a salty taste-enhancing agent including a compound represented by any one of the following general formulae (2) to (6) or a salt thereof. The salty taste-enhancing agent including a compound represented by any one of the following general formulae (2) to (6) or a salt thereof is particularly preferred from the viewpoints that the salty taste-enhancing effect is high and very little or no foreign taste and foreign odor can be sensed. [In the formulae: Q represents a heteroatom, and q represents 0 or 1; m and n each represent an integer of from 1 to 4, and m+n is an integer of from 3 to 5; m′ and n′ each represent an integer of from 1 to 3, and m′+n° is an integer of from 2 to 4; and k represents an integer of from 0 to 3.] In the general formulae (2) and (3), m and n each represent an integer of from 1 to 4, and m+n is an integer of from 3 to 5. In the general formulae (4) and (5), m′ and n′ each represent an integer of from 1 to 3, and m′+n′ is an integer of from 2 to 4. In the general formula (6), k represents an integer of from 0 to 3. In the general formulae (2) to (6), —CmH2m—, —CnH2n—, —Cm′H2m′—, —Cn′H2n′—, and —CkH2k— represent alkylene groups having m, n, m′, n′, and k carbon atoms, respectively. Preferred aspects of the alkylene groups include the following linear alkylene groups or branched alkylene groups each having a methyl group as a branch, in such a range that m and n, m′ and n′, or k satisfies the above-mentioned condition. Particularly preferred aspects of the alkylene groups include the following linear alkylene groups. —CH2—, —CH2—CH2—, —CH2CH2CH2—, —CH2CH2CH2CH2—, Specific examples of the compound represented by the general formula (2) are given below.

Specific examples of the compound represented by the general formula (5) are given below. Specific examples of the compound represented by the general formula (6) are given below. A more preferred aspect of the salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention is exemplified by a salty taste-enhancing agent including a compound represented by any one of the following general formulae (2)′ to (6) ° or a salt thereof. [In the formulae, Q, q, m, n, m′,n′, and k are the same as those described above.] A particularly preferred aspect of the salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention is exemplified by a salty taste-enhancing agent including a compound represented by the following general formula (7) or a salt thereof. The salty taste-enhancing agent including a compound represented by the following general formula (7) or a salt thereof is particularly preferred from the viewpoints that the salty taste-enhancing effect is particularly high and no foreign taste and foreign odor can be sensed. [In the formula, p represents an integer of from 3 to 5.] Specific examples of the compound represented by the general formula (7) are given below. Synthesis Method The compound represented by the general formula (1) or salt thereof of the present invention may be synthesized, for example, by subjecting a guanidinylation reagent to a reaction with a primary amine compound (X) according to Reaction Scheme-1 (Reaction Formula-1) shown below. [In the formula, R is as defined above.] The primary amine compound (X) may be synthesized by a known technique. It should be appreciated that a commercially available product may be used as the compound (X). A known guanidinylation reagent may be used as the guanidinylation reagent. Suitable examples of the guanidinylation reagent include, but not limited to, 1,3-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-2-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)guanidine (1,3-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-2-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)guanidine) (Goodman's reagent), 1-amidinopyrazole hydrochloride, N,N′-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine, and N,N′-bis(carbobenzoxy)-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine. The amount of the guanidinylation reagent to be used is generally from about 0.1 mol to an excessive amount, preferably from about 0.8 mol to 2.0 mol, with respect to 1 mol of the compound (X). It is preferred that the reaction shown in Reaction Scheme-1 be performed in the presence of a base. Examples of the base that may be used include, but not limited to, tertiary amines such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-dimethylpiperazine, N-methylpiperazine, and pyridine. The amount of the base to be used is generally from 0.8 mol to an excessive amount, preferably from about 1.0 mol to 2.0 mol, with respect to 1 mol of the compound (X). The reaction shown in Reaction Scheme-1 may be performed in a solvent. The solvent is not particularly limited as long as the progress of the reaction is not inhibited. Specific examples of such solvent include, but not limited to, dichloromethane, chloroform, dimethylformamide, and tetrahydrofuran. One kind of the solvents may be used alone, or two or more kinds thereof may be used as a mixture. Alternatively, when the base is a liquid, the base may be used as the solvent. The reaction temperature of the reaction shown in Reaction Formula-1 is generally from 0° C. to 150° C., preferably from about 15° C. to 50° C. The reaction time of the reaction shown in Reaction Formula-1 is generally from about 0.1 to 24 hours. In the case of using a guanidinylation reagent having bonded thereto a protective group, such as 1,3-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-2-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)guanidine, the removal of the protective group (deprotection reaction) is performed. The deprotection reaction may be performed, for example, under an acidic condition. The “under an acidic condition” is specifically exemplified by, but not limited to, “in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or trifluoroacetic acid.” The compound represented by the general formula (1) or salt thereof of the present invention may also be synthesized by subjecting S-methylisothiourea or a salt thereof to a reaction with a primary amine compound (X) according to Reaction Scheme-2 (Reaction Formula-2) shown below. The guanidinylation reagent to be used in the synthesis method of Reaction Scheme-1 is expensive, and hence the synthesis method according to Reaction Scheme-2 is more preferred from the viewpoint of cost. [In the formula, R is as defined above.] The salt of S-methylisothiourea is not particularly limited as long as the synthesis of the compound represented by the general formula (1) is not inhibited. Examples thereof include salts of organic acids and salts of inorganic acids. Specific examples thereof include a hydrochloride, a sulfate, a nitrate, an acetate, a trichloroacetate, and a formate. Of those, a sulfate is preferred from the viewpoint of easy availability. The amount of S-methylisothiourea or the salt thereof to be used is generally from about 0.1 to 10 mol, preferably from about 0.5 to 3.0 mol, with respect to 1 mol of the compound (X). The reaction shown in Reaction Scheme-2 may be performed in the absence of a solvent or in a solvent. The solvent is not particularly limited as long as the progress of the reaction is not inhibited. The solvent is specifically exemplified by, but not limited to, water. The reaction temperature of the reaction shown in Reaction Scheme-2 is generally from 0 to 200° C., preferably from about 50 to 150° C. The reaction time of the reaction shown in Reaction Scheme-2 is generally from about 10 minutes to 24 hours. When the salt of S-methylisothiourea is used in the reaction shown in Reaction Scheme-2, a corresponding salt of the compound represented by the general formula (1) is generally obtained as a product. For example, when S-methylisothiourea sulfate is used, a sulfate of the compound represented by the general formula (1) is obtained as a product. In this case, the salt of the compound represented by the general formula (1) to be obtained may be used as it is, or may be converted to another acid salt, as necessary. A technique for the conversion is not particularly limited. For example, in the case of converting a sulfate to a hydrochloride, there may be employed a technique involving: converting a sulfate to a mixture of a hydrochloride and the sulfate by adding about 0.1 to 100 mol, preferably about 1 to 10 mol of sodium chloride (NaCl) or calcium chloride (CaCl2) with respect to 1 mol of the sulfate in the presence of silica gel; and isolating and purifying only the hydrochloride from the resultant mixture by means of differences in physical properties (e.g., solubility in a solvent) between the sulfate and the hydrochloride. In an alternative aspect, there may be employed a technique involving: converting a sulfate to a corresponding organic acid salt by performing elution using a solution containing an organic acid (e.g., acetic acid or formic acid) as a mobile phase in a chromatography method (e.g., silica gel is used as a carrier); and converting the resultant organic acid salt to a hydrochloride by azeotropy with an excessive amount of hydrochloric acid. A product to be obtained through the reaction shown in Reaction Formula-1 or the reaction shown in Reaction Formula-2 may be isolated and purified by means to be generally performed. Examples of such means include, but not limited to, a recrystallization method, a distillation method, and a chromatography method. Thus, the compound represented by the general formula (1) or the salt thereof is produced. The synthesis of the compound may be confirmed, for example, by known means such as 1H-NMR measurement, 13C-NMR measurement, or mass spectrometry (e.g., electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS-ESI)). When the compound represented by the general formula (1) or the salt thereof is available as a commercially available product, the commercially available product may also be used. The salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention exhibits a salty taste-enhancing action of allowing a salty taste of salt to be strongly sensed. The salty taste-enhancing action may be evaluated by a sensory test. An example of the sensory test is a method involving comparing salty taste intensities of a salt aqueous solution at a predetermined concentration (e.g., 0.7 wt %) (control) and a salt aqueous solution at the same concentration containing an ingredient to be tested (Sample A) When the ingredient to be tested has a salty taste-enhancing action, a stronger salty taste is sensed in Sample A as compared to the control. In addition, in evaluating the salty taste-enhancing action, the salty taste-enhancing action may be quantified by: comparing salty taste intensities of a salt aqueous solution containing an ingredient to be tested (Sample B) and a salt aqueous solution group (control group) at a higher concentration than that of Sample B; and searching a salt concentration at which a salty taste equal to that of Sample B is sensed. In order that the salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention may exhibit an effect, it is necessary to use the salty taste-enhancing agent in combination with salt. However, most of foods and beverages required to have a reduced salt content, such as a seasoning or soup, originally contain salt. Thus, the salty taste-enhancing agent can exhibit a salty taste-enhancing effect by coexisting with salt contained in the foods and beverages. Besides, the salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention is hardly accompanied by foreign taste and foreign odor, which have been considered as problems in the related art. That is, the coexistence of the salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention with salt in a food and beverage can achieve both of a reduced salt content and high food palatability. The food and beverage is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include: seasonings such as soy sauce, miso sauce, and ketchup; seasonings containing hydrolyzed animal and vegetable proteins (HAP and HVP), yeast extract, amino acids, peptides, and the like as main ingredients; seasoning foods to be used for seasoning of foods, such as soup powder, seasoning soy sauce, tare sauce, roux, and dressing; processed cereals such as noodles, bread, and snacks; processed meat and fish such as ham and sausages and surimi; soup; pickles; and daily dishes. In addition, the food and beverage includes instant foods that may be cooked by addition of hot water or water (e.g., powder and liquid soup for instant noodles, instant consommé soup, potage soup, Chinese soup, miso soup, suimono, and soup-type instant noodles). The amount of the salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention to be added to the food and beverage is not particularly limited. The food and beverage required to have a reduced salt content generally has added thereto about 0.2 to 2.0 wt %, particularly about 0.5 to 1.5 wt % of salt in terms of a concentration at the time of food and beverage intake. The salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention can exhibit a salty taste-enhancing action when added at, for example, 1 ppm or more, preferably 10 ppm or more, particularly preferably 15 ppm or more at the time of food and beverage intake, with respect to the salt contained in the food and beverage in such amount as described above. The upper limit is not particularly limited, but may be set to 20% or less, preferably 5% or less from the viewpoints of solubility and taste property. The salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention may be provided in the form of only the above-mentioned compound, or may be provided in the form of a solid composition or a liquid composition. The salty taste-enhancing agent, when provided as the composition, may contain an additive that may be used for production of foods and beverages, such as an excipient, a dye, or a flavor, as necessary, as long as the salty taste-enhancing action is not inhibited. The salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention may be provided as a food additive including the above-mentioned compound or salt thereof, for example. 2.

Such aspect also encompasses: a seasoning including the above-mentioned compound or salt thereof (salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention) and sodium chloride; and a seasoning obtained by blending such seasoning with an additive that may be used for production of foods and beverages, such as an excipient, a dye, or a flavor, as necessary. In the seasoning of the present invention, the content of the above-mentioned compound or salt thereof only needs to be 1 ppm or more, preferably 10 ppm or more, particularly preferably 15 ppm or more at the time of food and beverage intake. When the seasoning of the present invention contains sodium chloride, the content of sodium chloride only needs to be from about 0.1 to 2.0 wt %, particularly from about 0.3 to 1.5 wt % at the time of food and beverage intake. The present invention also provides a food and beverage including the above-mentioned compound or salt thereof (salty taste-enhancing agent of the present invention). As a preferred aspect thereof, there is given a food and beverage having added thereto the above-mentioned compound or salt thereof. Herein, the term “added” refers to that the above-mentioned compound or salt thereof is not derived from a raw material for a food and beverage, but is separately added.

Samples 1 to 3 were subjected to a sensory test based on a paired comparison with each of the control formulation soup and the reduced-salt formulation soup. Table 5 shows the results of the sensory test. TABLE 5 3-Guanidino-1-propanol hydrochloride (wt %) Sensory evaluation result Control 0 formulation Reduced-salt 0 The whole taste including the formulation salty taste was light as compared to the control formulation. Sample 1 0.1 The salty taste was markedly increased as compared to the reduced-salt formulation, but was weak as compared to the control formulation. Sample 2 0.15 The salty taste was slightly weak as compared to the control formulation. Sample 3 0.2 There was almost no difference from the control formulation in taste and flavor including the salty taste. As shown in Table 5, it was found that the salty taste-enhancing effect was improved depending on the concentration of 3-guanidino-1-propanol hydrochloride, and its addition at 0.2 wt % exhibited a salty taste-enhancing effect of 25% in the noodle soup for instant noodles.
