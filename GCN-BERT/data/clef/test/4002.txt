Technical Field The present disclosure relates to an apparatus for penetration of body tissue. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to an obturator including an instrument holding mechanism for selectively securing an endoscope, laparoscope, or other surgical instruments within the obturator to provide visualization during penetration of the peritoneum or other body tissue. 2. Background of Related Art In endoscopic surgical procedures, surgery is performed in any hollow viscus of the body through a small incision or through narrow endoscopic tubes (cannulas) inserted through a small entrance wound in the skin or through a naturally occurring orifice. In laparoscopic procedures, surgery is performed in the interior of the abdomen. Laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures often require the clinician to act on organs, tissues and vessels far removed from the incision, thereby requiring that any instruments used in such procedures be of sufficient size and length to permit remote operation. Generally, a trocar includes a stylet or obturator having a sharp tip for penetrating the body cavity. Typically, a trocar is used to puncture the body cavity and may include a cannula that remains in place for use during the laparoscopic procedure. Subsequently, the surgical region is insufflated thereby creating a working space. It may be advantageous to provide an obturator that can be placed within an incision or body opening of a patient with a structure to retain a viewing instrument in a desired position during a surgical procedure.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS As used herein, the term โdistalโ refers to the portion that is being described which is farther from a user, while the term โproximalโ refers to the portion that is being described which is closer to a user. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail to avoid obscuring the present disclosure in unnecessary detail. Further, to the extent consistent, any of the embodiments described herein may be used in conjunction with any or all of the other embodiments described herein. Referring now to the drawings, in which like reference numerals identify identical or substantially similar parts throughout the several views, FIG. 1 illustrates one exemplary embodiment of surgical device 10 which is in accordance with the present disclosure. Device 10 includes elongate tubular member 20 having proximal end 21, distal end 22, and sidewall 23. Sidewall 23 defines bore 24 extending between proximal end 21 and distal end 22 as shown in FIG. 8. Sidewall 23 may include holes as shown in FIG. 1. Now referring to FIG. 2, elongate tubular member 20 includes first and second flanges 25, 26 which extend radially from sidewall 23. First and second flanges 25, 26 may be generally cylindrical. First and second flanges 25, 26 may have the same diameter or different diameters with either first flange 25 having a diameter larger or smaller than second flange 26. First and second flanges 25, 26 may have the same thickness or different thicknesses with the thickness of first flange 25 being greater or less than the thickness of second flange 26. First and second flanges 25, 26 may have surfaces perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the elongate tubular member 20 or have surfaces at angle other than perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the elongate tubular member 20. Further, first and second flanges 25, 26 may also be parallel with respect to each other or be askew with respect to each other. The proximal and distal surfaces of first and second flanges 25, 26 may be parallel with respect to each other or be askew with respect to each other. First and second flanges 25, 26 define housing 30 therebetween. Housing 30 may include instrument retention element 40 as shown in FIG. 2. Housing 30 may include wall 38 between first and second flanges 25, 26 as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. Bore 24 may define through slot 39 in wall 38. Now referring to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 3-5, instrument retention element 40 partially obstructs bore 24. Instrument retention element 40 is disposed within slot 37 in housing 30. Slot 37 extends through sidewall 23. Instrument retention element 40 is configured to selectively engage instrument 280 as shown in FIGS. 10 and 11. Instrument retention element 40 may include inner flange 41 and outer flange 42 configured to retain instrument retention element 40 within slot 37 as shown in FIG. 5. Instrument 280 may allow a clinician to directly or indirectly see within body cavity 254 through surgical device 10 as shown in FIG. 7. Instrument 280 may be a scope. Instrument 280 may also have a plurality of diameters. Instrument retention element 40 may also be configured to restrict the longitudinal and radial movement of the instrument 280. In a particular embodiment of device 10, instrument retention element 40 is made from a compliant material. In this embodiment, instrument retention element 40 partially deforms when engaging instrument 280 as shown in FIGS. 10 and 11. The surface characteristics of instrument retention element 40 may be configured such that the friction between the surface of instrument retention element 40 and instrument 280 restricts the longitudinal and radial movement of instrument 280. In another embodiment of device 10 shown in FIGS. 12-15, instrument retention element 60 is made from a rigid material. Instrument retention element 60 may include one or two legs 61 and backspan 62. Backspan 62 is connected to leg 61. When instrument retention element 60 has two legs 61, backspan 62 connects legs 61 together. Leg 61 may include locking mechanism 65. Locking mechanism 65 may be a tab 66 configured to be received by housing 30. Tab 66 may be configured to act like a clip with detent 67 engaging wall 38 of housing 30. Referring now to FIGS. 14 and 15, instrument retention element 60 may act like a leaf spring when engaging instrument 280. When instrument 280 is inserted into bore 24 past instrument retention element 60, instrument 280 moves backspan 62 in the direction of the arrow shown in FIG. 15. In turn, instrument retention element 60 exerts a force on instrument 280. This force restricts the longitudinal and radial movement of instrument 280 with respect to device 10. In yet another embodiment of device 10 illustrated in FIGS. 16-18, instrument retention element 70 is located near distal end 22 of device 10. Instrument retention element 70 may include a single structure or a plurality of structures positioned radially for at least partially obstructing bore 24. Alternatively, instrument retention element 70 may be a ring. Instrument retention element 70 may be constructed of a compliant material which partially deforms when receiving instrument 280. Instrument retention element 70 may restrict the longitudinal and radial movement of instrument 280. Instrument retention element 70 may be attached to inner surface 23a of sidewall 23 or located in recess 52 in sidewall 23. Instrument retention element 70 may also be located in tip 29 which is positioned at distal end 22 of elongate tubular member 20 as shown in FIG. 18. Instrument 280 may include structure 281 configured to engage instrument retention element 70 when structure 281 passes instrument retention element 70 as shown in FIG. 17. Structure 281 may be a recess, a detent, a rib, or any known means for engaging instrument retention element 70. In still another embodiment of device 10 illustrated in FIGS. 19-21, instrument retention element 80 is located between proximal and distal ends 21, 22. In this embodiment device 10 may include housing 30 near proximal end 21. Instrument retention element 80 is be made from an elastomeric material which expands when receiving instrument 280. The interference between instrument 280 and instrument retention element 80 restricts the longitudinal and radial movement of instrument 280. Instrument 280 may include a structure 281 configured to engage instrument retention element 80 when structure 281 passes instrument retention element 80. Structure 281 may be a recess, a detent, a rib, or any known means for engaging instrument retention element 80. The elastomeric material of instrument retention element 80 may form an O-ring. This embodiment may include retainer 82 in interior surface 23a of sidewall 23 configured to retain instrument retention element 80 in a fixed longitudinal position within bore 24. Retainer 82 may be a depression as shown in FIGS. 19 and 20. The depression may form an annular groove (not shown). Retainer 82 may be parallel ribs as shown in FIG. 21. There may be a plurality of parallel ribs displaced around the circumference of interior surface 23 where each parallel rib is across from an adjacent rib or each parallel rib may be across from a space between adjacent ribs. The parallel ribs may also form at least one complete ring around the circumference of interior surface 23. In still yet another embodiment of device 10 illustrated in FIGS. 22 and 23, instrument retention element 90 is located at proximal end 21 of device 10. Instrument retention element 90 includes flange 91 expanding radially from elongate tubular member 20. Flange 91 partially obstructs bore 24 and includes longitudinal slot 82. Flange 91 may include a plurality of slots 82. When instrument retention element 90 receives instrument 280, slot 82 expands. The interference between flange 91 and instrument 280 restricts the longitudinal and radial movement of instrument 280. Instrument 280 may include a structure 281 configured to engage flange 91 when structure 281 passes flange 91. Structure 281 may be a recess, a detent, a rib, or any known means for engaging flange 91. In another embodiment, the present disclosure may relate to a surgical device in which the instrument retention element resides and is supported on the outer surface of the obturator, but extends into the longitudinal channel of the obturator through bores defined by a sidewall of the obturator. An example embodiment of such an arrangement is shown in, e.g., FIGS. 24 and 25. As shown therein, an obturator includes a sidewall 23 having an arcuate outer surface 23b. In addition, the sidewall 23 has an arcuate inner surface 23a that defines a central longitudinal channel, e.g., bore 24, into which an instrument may be inserted. The sidewall 23 further defines at least one bore 29 extending between the arcuate inner and outer surfaces 23a, 23b of the sidewall 23. The instrument retention element 80 engages the arcuate outer surface 23b of the obturator such that the instrument retention element 80 extends radially into the bore 29. At least a portion of the instrument retention element 80 extends radially inward of the arcuate inner surface 23a so as to engage an instrument inserted into the central longitudinal channel of the obturator. Advantageously, and as set forth above in connection with other embodiments described herein, the instrument retention element 80 may be made from an elastomeric material. The instrument retention element 80 may be an o-ring. It should also be noted that the instrument retention element 80 may be located on either the elongate tubular member or the handle located at the proximal end of the obturator. The embodiment shown in FIGS. 24 and 25 may have particular advantages. For example, use of such an arrangement during manufacture may significantly simplify the assembly process as well as improve the safety and effectiveness of the device. For example, rather than the instrument retention element, e.g., o-ring, being inserted into the interior of the obturator (which could be quite difficult to accomplish in view of the narrow channel into which it must be inserted), the instrument retention element may be mounted on the outside surface of the obturator during the assembly processed and then moved, e.g., rolled, into its appropriate longitudinal position (where the bores 29 are located). Furthermore, by supporting the instrument retention element on the outer surface of the obturator, there is far less likelihood of the instrument retention element becoming dislodged from the obturator than if the instrument retention element is supported by the interior surface of the obturator alone. Dislodgement of the instrument retention element during surgery could pose a serious concern if it was to fall, or be pushed, into a body cavity by the obturator. In order to use the surgical device shown in FIGS. 24 and 25, a user may insert an instrument, e.g., an endoscope, into the central longitudinal channel of the obturator such that the instrument retention element 80 engages the instrument and restricts longitudinal movement of the instrument relative to the obturator. The user may then use the obturator to engage, e.g., penetrate, tissue during a surgical procedure. In embodiments wherein the obturator is formed of a clear material, the endoscope may provide a visual image of the tissue being penetrated. Referring now to FIGS. 6 and 7, a method for using surgical device 10 is disclosed. First, incision 255 is made in tissue layer 251. Incision 255 may be created by tip 29 of surgical device 10, by any other known methods such as a scalpel, or may be a naturally occurring orifice. Cannula 210 is then placed within incision 255 to provide access to a surgical working site. Fixing structure 215 on cannula 210 is configured to maintain the longitudinal and angular position of cannula 210 within incision 255 in relation to body cavity 254. Once cannula 210 is secured in a desired position, surgical device 10 is then inserted and secured to cannula 210. Alternatively, if surgical device 10 was used to create incision 255 or surgical device 10 is inserted in a natural orifice, surgical device 10 may be is inserted in cannula 210 before incision 255 is created. Once inserted cannula 210 is in the desired position, surgical device 10 is inserted into body cavity 254 until housing 30 mates with the proximal end 211 of cannula 210. Housing 30 may be configured to secure surgical device 10 to cannula 210. When surgical device 10 is in the desired position, the clinician inserts instrument 280 into bore 24. When instrument 280 is inserted into bore 24, instrument 280 is engaged by an instrument retention element (any of the disclosed instrument retention elements 40, 60, 70, 80, or 90 may be used). The instrument retention element may be configured to allow the clinician to insert instrument 280 to a desired position within bore 24 while maintaining instrument 280 in the desired position once the clinician releases instrument 280. Once in the desired position, the clinician is able to directly view body cavity 254 through instrument 280 or indirectly view body cavity 254 on a monitor (not shown) receiving a signal from instrument 280.
