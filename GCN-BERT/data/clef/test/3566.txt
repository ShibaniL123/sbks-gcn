Step 10 Synthesis of Compound 180
Under ice-cooling, to Compound 179 (956 mg, 1.40 mmol) in DMF (9.57 mL) solution were added potassium carbonate (386 mg, 2.79 mmol) and thiophenol (231 mg, 2.10 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 0Â°C for 70 minutes. Ethyl acetate and 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid were added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 180 (632 mg, 91% yield).
