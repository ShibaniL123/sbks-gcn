CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is the U.S. National Phase of International Application No. PCT/EP2013/054164, filed Mar. 1, 2013, designating the U.S. and published in English as WO 2013/128000 on Sep. 6, 2013 which claims the benefit of Spain Patent Application No. 201230319, filed Mar. 2, 2012. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel crystalline form of the addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid, to processes for obtaining the same, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said crystalline form and to methods for treating type 2 diabetes which comprise administering said pharmaceutical compositions to patients. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Sitagliptin, the chemical name of which is (2R)-4-oxo-4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6-dihydro[1,2,4]triazol[4,3-α]pyrazin-7(8H)-yl]-1-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan-2-amine, is a member of a class of antihyperglycemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) inhibitors which improve blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes patients by increasing the concentrations of incretin hormones. These hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day and their concentrations increase in response to food intake. The activity of GLP-1 and of GIP is limited by the DPP-IV enzyme which quickly hydrolyzes incretins and transforms them into inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents this incretin hydrolysis by DPP-IV, so plasma concentrations of active forms of GLP-1 and GIP increase. As a result, sitagliptin increases insulin release and reduces the concentration of glucagon in a glucose dependent manner. Sitagliptin was commercially authorized by the European Medicines Agency in March 2007. The medicinal product is currently marketed under the name Januvia®, being formulated with the dihydrogen phosphate salt of sitagliptin. European patent EP 1412357 B1 (WO 2003/004498 A2) protects sitagliptin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Likewise, in relation to the marketed medicinal product, a subsequent European patent EP 1654263 B1 (WO 2005/003135 A2) (MERCK; Jul. 18, 2004) specifically protects the dihydrogen phosphate salt of sitagliptin. It is known by the person skilled in the art that different salts of one and the same pharmaceutically active substance can have different physical properties (melting point, solubility, hygroscopicity, etc). Even the existence of different crystalline forms of one and the same salt of one and the same pharmaceutically active substance can also have considerably different physical properties. Said differences can accordingly influence the pharmaceutical properties of the medicinal product formulated with the crystalline forms, without the person skilled in the art being able to predict a priori the existence of these crystalline forms or the different physical characteristics that they may have. In this respect, several documents of the state of the art have described the existence of different crystalline forms of the addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid. International application WO 2009/085990 A2 describes the production of an anhydrous crystalline form of sitagliptin sulfate salt and its characterization by means of DSC (Differential Scanning calorimetry), TGA (Thermal Gravimetric Analysis) and XRPD (X-Ray Powder Diffraction). However and in the hands of the inventors of the present application, said crystalline form is hygroscopic under the conditions of the European Pharmacopeia Ed. 6.0 Section 5.11 (24 hours at 80% RH and 25° C.), readily reaching a water proportion corresponding to a dihydrate form. International application WO 2010/000469 A2 describes the production of an ethanol solvate (Form I) and of a crystalline form of sitagliptin sulfate salt (Form II). Both forms were characterized by means of DSC and XRPD, Form II having a water content corresponding to a monohydrate compound. This same form quickly reaches greater degrees of hydration (Table 21 of the application) under 43% and 75% relative humidity conditions, indicating the hygroscopic characteristics thereof. International application WO 2010/092090 A2 describes the production of a crystalline form of sitagliptin sulfate salt, the characterization of which by means of XRPD is consistent with the crystalline form described in International application WO 2009/085990 A2. Finally, international applications WO 2010/117738 A1 and WO 2011/123641 A1 describe the production of 19 crystalline forms (called S1 to S20 except form S15 which is not described) of sitagliptin sulfate salt (some of them, for example S4 and S5, being those previously described in the applications indicated above). The crystalline forms of these two applications are mainly characterized by means of their corresponding XRPD. According to the inventors, forms S7 and S13 are isopropanol solvate and methanol solvate, respectively. Crystalline form S14 is a monohydrate, crystalline form S16 is a sesquihydrate and crystalline forms S1, S9 and S11 are dihydrates. Despite not further describing physical properties of the remaining crystalline forms, there is data relating to same which indicate that crystalline forms S2 and S6 are transformed into form S9 under 100% relative humidity conditions, crystalline forms S13 and S16 and S18 are transformed into crystalline forms S14, S17 and S14, respectively, when the wet compound residual solvent is dried in a standard manner, crystalline form S17 is transformed into form S14 by being kept at a temperature of 50° C. (24 hours) or form S14 is transformed into form S1 or into a mixture of forms S1 and S11 when they are subjected to an environment with a high relative humidity. They also describe that under standard wet compound residual solvent drying conditions, crystalline form S11 is transformed into form S12, crystalline form S16 is transformed into crystalline form S17, which in turn is transformed into crystalline form S14, crystalline form S18 is transformed into crystalline form S14. Furthermore, patent application WO 2011/123641 A1 states that crystalline forms S7 and S10 filter slowly. Based on what is described in the state of the art, it is necessary to obtain a crystalline form of the addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid with physical characteristics that allows it to be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions with assured stability. SUMMARY Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel crystalline form of the addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid (1:1), having improved physical and pharmaceutical properties which is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at 2θ values equal to 14.8±0.2°, 15.1±0.2°, 17.1±0.2°, 19.4±0.2°, 21.9±0.2°, 24.0±0.2° and 25.4±0.2°, and by having a DSC with an endothermic signal at approximately 216° C. One aspect of the present invention also provides a process for obtaining the novel crystalline form of the addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid (1:1) that can be readily industrialized. Another aspect of the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of the novel crystalline form of the addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid (1:1), as well as a method for treating type 2 diabetes which comprises administering a formulation comprising said pharmaceutical composition to patients.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel crystalline form, called form M, of the addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid (1:1) having an unexpected stability in terms of its hygroscopicity characteristics. In the present invention the terms addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid (1:1) and sitagliptin sulfate are used interchangeably to designate the salt formed by one mole of sitagliptin and one mole of sulfuric acid. The crystalline form obtained has a percentage of water of less than 0.05% determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (under the conditions described in the experimental part) and it was found to be non-hygroscopic under the conditions of the European Pharmacopeia Ed. 6.0 Section 5.11, i.e., the degree of hydration at 80% relative humidity and at a temperature of 25° C. is less than 0.2%; nor is the crystalline form hygroscopic at 97% relative humidity and at a temperature of 25° C. The crystalline form was characterized by means of XRPD and DSC under the conditions described in the experimental part. The characterization by means of XRPD shows a highly crystalline state, unlike what was observed in virtually all the crystalline forms of sitagliptin sulfate salt described above. This is shown in an XRPD pattern with a number of well defined peaks. The novel crystalline form, called form M, of the addition salt of sitagliptin with sulfuric acid (1:1) has a pattern having peaks at 2θ values equal to 14.8±0.2°, 15.1±0.2°, 17.1±0.2°, 19.4±0.2°, 21.9±0.2°, 24.0±0.2° and 25.4±0.2°, and more preferably also having peaks at 2θ values equal to 18.5±0.2°, 19.8±0.2°, 23.0±0.2° and 26.7±0.2°. Analysis by means of DSC gives a melting endotherm at 216.0±1.0° C. Said value is the highest value out of those described in the literature for the crystalline forms of sulfate salt and for any other pharmaceutically acceptable salt of sitagliptin other than the marketed phosphate salt and tosylate salt (described in WO2005/072530A) and dodecyl sulfate salt (described in WO2007/035198A). Another aspect of the present invention is a process for obtaining the novel crystalline form from sitagliptin base. This process comprises reacting a sulfuric acid solution with a sitagliptin base solution or suspension (preferably a solution) in a mixture of water and one or more water-miscible organic solvents. Water-miscible organic solvent is understood as an organic compound, liquid at 10° C., which can be mixed with water in any proportion to form a solution. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of volume (in ml) of organic solvent to weight (in g) of sitagliptin base is between 10:1 and 30:1 and the ratio of volume (in ml) of water to weight (in g) of sitagliptin base is between 1:1 and 5:1, more preferably the ratio of volume (in ml) of organic solvent to weight (in g) of sitagliptin base is between 15:1 and 20:1 and the ratio of volume (in ml) of water to weight (in g) of sitagliptin base is between 1:1 and 3:1. Volume of organic solvent includes both the volume used for dissolving or suspending the sitagliptin base and that which is added together with the sulfuric acid. In one embodiment of the invention, the sulfuric acid solution is added to the sitagliptin base suspension or solution at a ratio comprised between 0.9:1 and 1.1:1 moles of H2SO4 per mol of sitagliptin base. In one embodiment of the present invention, the sulfuric acid is a sulfuric acid solution with a concentration greater than 40%, preferably greater than 50%, more preferably greater than 75%, more preferably greater than 95% and still more preferably greater than 98%, for example 98.1%. In another embodiment of the present invention, the water-miscible organic solvent/solvents is/are selected from solvents which are capable of dissolving at least 1 g of sitagliptin sulfate per 10 ml of solvent at a temperature of 25° C. when mixed with 1 ml of water, or in other words, a mixture of 10 ml of said solvent/solvents and 1 ml of water is capable of dissolving at least 1 g of sitagliptin sulfate at a temperature of 25° C. In another embodiment of the present invention, the water-miscible organic solvent/solvents is/are selected from the group consisting of acetone and aliphatic alcohols with 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, 1-pentanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 2,2-dimethyl-1-propanol, 3-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-methyl-2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-butanol, preferably 2-propanol and ethanol, more preferably ethanol. In another embodiment of the present invention, the production process described above can comprise using crystals obtained previously from the novel crystalline form object of the present invention. It is believed that said crystals act as crystallization nuclei facilitating product crystallization. Sitagliptin base can be easily obtained from the known starting compounds (3R)-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)-butyric acid and 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazine, as described in document WO 2009/064476 A1, using a method based on the documents by Merck & Co. WO 2003/004498 A2 or Journal Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, 48(1), 141-151. The condensation of both mentioned compounds yields the corresponding N-protected intermediate. The acid hydrolysis of the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group allows finally obtaining sitagliptin base as a white solid with a melting point of 115° C., coinciding with that described above in the literature (WO 2004/085378 A2). In another embodiment of the present invention, the crystalline form of the invention can be obtained by means of crystallizing sitagliptin sulfate (1:1) of a mixture of water and one or more water-miscible organic solvents. The starting product used can be sitagliptin sulfate in an amorphous form or in any crystalline form. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of volume (in ml) of organic solvent to weight (in g) of sitagliptin sulfate is between 10:1 and 30:1 and the ratio of volume (in ml) of water to weight (in g) of sitagliptin sulfate is between 1:1 and 5:1, more preferably the ratio of volume (in ml) of organic solvent to weight (in g) of sitagliptin sulfate is between 15:1 and 20:1 and the ratio of volume (in ml) of water to weight (in g) of sitagliptin sulfate is between 1:1 and 3:1. In another embodiment of the present invention, the water-miscible solvent is selected from acetone and aliphatic alcohols with 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, 1-pentanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 2,2-dimethyl-1-propanol, 3-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-methyl-2-butanol and 2-methyl-2-butanol, preferably 2-propanol and ethanol, more preferably ethanol. In another embodiment of the present invention, the production process from sitagliptin sulfate described above can comprise using crystals obtained previously from the novel crystalline form object of the present invention. It is believed that said crystals act as crystallization nuclei facilitating product crystallization. The presence of water in the medium is necessary for obtaining the crystalline form of the invention. All the tests performed from sitagliptin base in a water-free organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents led to the production of sitagliptin sulfate that does not coincide with the crystalline form of the invention.

PSD The analysis is performed in a Sympatec Helos laser diffraction particle analyzer no. 1054. The processor used is Windox 5.4.0.0 HRLD and the measurement is made with a R3 lens (measurement range: 0.9 to 175 mm) at a pressure of 1.5 bar. The measurement provides the values D10, D50 and D90 representing the measurement below which 10%, 50% and 90% of the particles of the product on which the measurement was taken are found, respectively. Water Content (Karl-Fisher Method) The analysis is performed in a Mettler Toledo W30. It is determined in 0.2 g of sample using Hydranal medium K as solvent and Hydranal composite 5K as titrant. Example 1 25.0 g of sitagliptin base (61.3 mmoles) were dissolved at 25-26° C. in a mixture of 190 ml of absolute ethanol and 30 ml of water. A previously prepared solution of 98.1% H2SO4 (6.2 g, 62.01 mmoles) in ethanol (190 ml) was slowly added to said solution, maintaining the temperature between 20-25° C. 27.5 ml of water were then added to the obtained mixture and it was heated to approximately 50° C.
