Methods and Compositions for Treating Fungal Infected Keratinized Tissue with Stable Superoxide Solution TECHNICAL FIELD Methods and compositions for treating keratinized tissue, which is infected with dermatophytic fungus, with a stable superoxide solution are disclosed. BACKGROUND According to the journal article Garber (An overview of fungal infections. Drugs. 2000;61 SuppI 1 :1 -12), the increase of fungal infections is on the rise and is directly related to the increase in immunocompromised individuals. Immunocompromised individuals include those that have HIV, are undergoing cancer therapies, are diabetic and those on immunosuppressive drugs, for example. These groups of people represent a growing segment of the population. Included in the types of fungal infections that are growing at alarming rates are subcutaneous fungal infections which affect keratinous tissues. Keratinous tissues are those tissues comprising keratin such as hair, skin, or nails. Dermatophytes are a common label for a group of funguses that can cause skin disease in animals and humans and can include subcutaneous fungal infections affecting keratinous tissues. The dermatophytes include three recognised genera: Epidermophyton, Microsporum and Trichophyton. Dermatophytes have the capacity to invade keratinized tissues, such as skin, hair, and nails, of humans and other animals to produce an infection termed dermatophytosis. Trichophyton mentagrophytes is known as a complex species and is one of the major pathogens causing this dermatophytosis (Makimura et al. Phylogenetic Classification of Trichophyton mentagrophytes Complex Strains Based on DNA Sequences of Nuclear Ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 Regions. J. Clin. Microbiol. September 1998 vol. 36 no. 9 2629-2633). There are a number of therapies currently being used for treating fungal infections. Polyene macrolides, such as Amphotericin-B and Nystatis, the Allylamines, Imidazoles and Triazoles are known therapies for treating and managing fungal infections but have their limitations. Imidazoles and Triazoles, such as Itraconazoles, have been used to specifically target dermatophytic infections, including Trichophyton species. (Jacques et al. Current Management of Fungal Infections. Drugs 2001 ; 61 SuppI. 1 : 13- 25.). It has long been known that the electrolysis of fluids can result in useful products. Thus, various apparatus and methods have been proposed for electrolyzing saline solution, however, all of the previously available schemes present one or more drawbacks. US 2012/0269904 A1 to Northey discloses a hypochlorous acid solution with a low pH for treating multiple fungi and yeast species and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7,691 ,249 teaches a method an apparatus for making electrolyzed water comprising an insulating end cap for a cylindrical electrolysis cell and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,236,992 and 4,316,787 to Themy disclose an electrode, method and apparatus for electrolyzing dilute saline solutions to produce effective amounts of disinfecting agents such as chlorine, ozone and hydroxide ions. Both of these references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,537, U.S. Pat. No. 6,1 17,285 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,007,686 also teach electrolyzed fluids and are now incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,344 teaches a water electrolyzing apparatus including a plurality of electrolysis devices, each comprising an electrolysis vessel having a cathode and an anode oppose to each other and an electrolysis diaphragm partitioning the space between both of the electrodes wherein the plurality of devices are connected in a series such that only one of the two ionized water discharge channels of the devices constitutes a water supply channel to the device a the succeeding stage and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. U.S. Pat. No. 7,691 ,249 is now incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and is directed to a method and apparatus for making electrolyzed water. U.S. Pat. No. 8,062,501 B2 is directed to a method for producing neutral electrolytic water containing OH, D2, HD and HDO as active elements and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Methods for treatment of physiological fluids using electrolyzed solutions are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,383 which is now incorporated herein by reference in its entirety teaches an electrolyzed saline solution, properly made and administered in vivo, as effective in the treatment of various infections brought on by invading antigens and particularly viral infections. U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,932 which is now incorporated herein by reference in its entirety teaches an apparatus for electrolyzing fluids. In sum, the art teaches various methods of making electrolyzed fluids but none teaches a stabilized fluid which can treat fungal infections. Although there are some current therapies on the market and available to treat fungal infections including the dermatophytes, given the constant increase in infections, there still remains a need for a better therapy.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In some embodiments, the present application discloses methods and compositions of treating a fungal infection of a subject. In other embodiments, the methods can comprise determining the presence of a fungal infection in a subject. Determining the presence of a fungal infection in a subject can include one or more of visual inspection of the infected site, biopsy of the infected site, examination by a medical professional of the infected site, culturing of samples taken from the infected site, nucleotide analysis of the infected site, or any other appropriate method to determine fungal infection. The methods can also comprise topically applying one or more times a composition comprising a mixture of reduced species (RS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In yet other embodiments, the reduced species can comprise at least one hypochlorite and the reactive oxygen species can comprise at least one superoxide. Described herein are antifungal compositions including fluids that generally include at least one redox signaling agent (RXN) and methods of using such compositions. RXNs can include, but are not limited to superoxides: 02*-, H02*; hypochlorites: OCI-, HOCI, NaOCI; hypochlorates: HCI02, CI02, HCI03, HCI04; oxygen derivatives: 02, 03, 04*-, 10; hydrogen derivatives: H2, H-; hydrogen peroxide: H202; hydroxyl free Radical: OH*-; ionic compounds: Na+, CI-, H+, 0H-, NaCI, HCI, NaOH; chlorine: CI2; water clusters: n*H20 - induced dipolar layers around ions and combinations thereof. Some RXNs are electron acceptors (RS) and include HOCI, NaCIO, 02, H2, H+, CIO, CI2, H202 and some are electron donors (ROS) and include 02-, H02, CI-, H-, OCI, 03, Ό2- and 0H-. Methods of producing the disclosed compositions can include one or more of the steps of (1 ) preparation of an ultra-pure homogeneous solution of sodium chloride in water, (2) temperature control and flow regulation through a set of inert catalytic electrodes and (3) a modulated electrolytic process that results in the formation of such stable molecular moieties and complexes; the RS and ROS. In one embodiment, such a process includes all these steps. A general example of one such method of making therapeutic compositions is described as comprising : electrolyzing salinated water having a salt concentration of about 2.8 g NaCI/L, using a set of electrodes with a current of about 3 amps, to form an antifungal composition, wherein the water is at or below room temperature during 3 minutes of electrolyzing. Another general example of one such method of making therapeutic compositions is described as comprising: electrolyzing salinated water having a salt concentration of about 9.1 g NaCI/L, using a set of electrodes with a current of about 3 amps, to form an antifungal composition, wherein the water is at or below room temperature during 3 minutes of electrolyzing. Water can be supplied from a variety of sources, including but not limited to municipal water, filtered water, nanopure water, or the like. With this in mind, a step in such a process is shown in Figure 1 . 100 is an optional reverse osmosis procedure 102. The reverse osmosis process can vary, but can provide water having a total dissolved solids content of less than about 10 ppm, about 9 ppm, about 8 ppm, about 7 ppm, about 6 ppm, about 5 ppm, about 4 ppm, about 3 ppm, about 2 ppm, about 1 ppm, or the like. The reverse osmosis process can be performed at a temperature of about 5°C, about 10°C, about 15°C, about 20°C, about 25°C, about 30°C, about 35°C, or the like. The reverse osmosis step can be repeated as needed to achieve a particular total dissolved solids level. Whether the optional reverse osmosis step is utilized, an optional distillation step 104 can be performed. Other means of reducing contaminants include filtration and/or purification such as by utilizing deionization, carbon filtration, double-distillation, electrodeionization, resin filtration such as with Milli-Q purification, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, ultraviolet oxidation, electrodialysis, or combinations thereof. The distillation process can vary, but can provide water having a total dissolved solids content of less than about 5 ppm, about 4 ppm, about 3 ppm, about 2 ppm, about 1 ppm, about 0.9 ppm, about 0.8 ppm, about 0.7 ppm, about 0.6 ppm, about 0.5 ppm, about 0.4 ppm, about 0.3 ppm, about 0.2 ppm, about 0.1 ppm, or the like. The temperature of the distillation process can be performed at a temperature of about 5°C, about 10°C, about 15°C, about 20°C, about 25°C, about 30°C, about 35°C, or the like. The distillation step can be repeated as needed to achieve a particular total dissolved solids level. After water has been subjected to reverse osmosis, distillation, both, or neither, the level of total dissolved solids in the water can be less than about 5 ppm, about 4 ppm, about 3 ppm, about 2 ppm, about 1 ppm, about 0.9 ppm, about 0.8 ppm, about 0.7 ppm, about 0.6 ppm, about 0.5 ppm, about 0.4 ppm, about 0.3 ppm, about 0.2 ppm, about 0.1 ppm, or the like. The reverse osmosis, distillation, both, or neither, can be preceded by a carbon filtration step. Purified water can be used directly with the systems and methods described herein. In one embodiment, contaminants can be removed from a commercial source of water by the following procedure: water flows through an activated carbon filter to remove the aromatic and volatile contaminants and then undergoes Reverse Osmosis (RO) filtration to remove dissolved solids and most organic and inorganic contaminants. The resulting filtered RO water can contain less than about 8 ppm of dissolved solids. Most of the remaining contaminants can be removed through a distillation process, resulting in dissolved solid measurements less than 1 ppm. In addition to removing contaminants, distillation may also serve to condition the water with the correct structure and Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) to facilitate the oxidative and reductive reaction potentials on the platinum electrodes in the subsequent electro-catalytic process. The saline generally should be free from contaminants, both organic and inorganic, and homogeneous down to the molecular level. In particular, metal ions can interfere with the electro-catalytic surface reactions, and thus it may be helpful for metals to be avoided. In one embodiment, a brine solution is used to salinate the water. The brine solution can have a NaCI concentration of about 540 g NaCI/gal, such as 537.5 g NaCI/gal. After water has been subjected to reverse osmosis, distillation, both or neither, or any other purification step as described herein, a salt is added to the water in a salting step 106 of Figure 1. The salt can be unrefined, refined, caked, de-caked, or the like. In one embodiment, the salt is sodium chloride (NaCI). In some embodiments, the salt can include an additive. Salt additives can include, but are not limited to potassium iodide, sodium iodidie, sodium iodate, dextrose, sodium fluoride, sodium ferrocyanide, tricalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, fatty acids, magnesium oxide, silicone dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate, calcium aluminosilicate, ferrous fumarate, iron, or folic acid. Any of these additives can be added at this point or at any point during the described process. For example, the above additives can be added just prior to bottling. In another embodiment, the process can be applied to any ionic, soluble salt mixture, especially with those containing chlorides. In addition to NaCI, other non-limiting examples include LiCI, HCI, CuCI2, CuS04, KCI, MgCI2, CaCI2, sulfates and phosphates. In other embodiments, ionic soluble salt mixtures can comprise one or more of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, LiCI, CuCI2, CuS04, KCI, MgCI2, CaCI2, sulfates, bromides, iodides, and phosphates. For example, strong acids such as sulfuric acid (H2S04), and strong bases such as potassium hydroxide (KOH), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) are frequently used as electrolytes due to their strong conducting abilities. Preferably the salt is sodium chloride (NaCI). A brine solution can be used to introduce the salt into the water. The amount of brine or salt needs will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Salt can be added to water in the form of a brine solution. To mix the brine solution, a physical mixing apparatus can be used or a circulation or recirculation can be used. In one embodiment, pure pharmaceutical grade sodium chloride is dissolved in the prepared distilled water to form a 15 wt % sub-saturated brine solution and continuously re-circulated and filtered until the salt has completely dissolved and all particles > 0.1 microns are removed. This step can take several days. The filtered, dissolved brine solution is then injected into tanks of distilled water in about a 1 :352 ratio (salt:water) in order to form a 0.3% saline solution. In one embodiment, a ratio 10.75 g of salt per 1 gallon of water can be used to form the composition. In another embodiment, 10.75 g of salt in about 3-4 g of water, such as 3,787.5 g of water can be used to form the composition. This solution then can be allowed to re-circulate and diffuse until homogeneity at the molecular scale has been achieved. The brine solution can have a NaCI concentration of about 540 g NaCI/gal, such as 537.5 g NaCI/gal. Brine can then be added to the previously treated water or to fresh untreated water to achieve a NaCI concentration of between about 1 g NaCI/gal water and about 25 g NaCI/gal water, between about 8 g NaCI/gal water and about 12 g NaCI/gal water, or between about 4 g NaCI/gal water and about 16 g NaCI/gal water. In a preferred example, the achieved NaCI concentration is 2.8 g/L of water. In another preferred example, the achieved NaCI concentration is 9.1 g/L of water. Once brine is added to water at an appropriate amount, the solution can be thoroughly mixed. The temperature of the liquid during mixing can be at room temperature or controlled to a desired temperature or temperature range. To mix the solution, a physical mixing apparatus can be used or a circulation or recirculation can be used. The salt solution can then be chilled in a chilling step 108 of Figure 1. For large amounts of composition, various chilling and cooling methods can be employed. For example cryogenic cooling using liquid nitrogen cooling lines can be used. Likewise, the solution can be run through propylene glycol heat exchangers to achieve the desired temperature. The chilling time can vary depending on the amount of liquid, the starting temperature and the desired chilled temperature. Products from the anodic reactions can be effectively transported to the cathode to provide the reactants necessary to form the stable complexes on the cathode surfaces. Maintaining a high degree of homogeneity in the fluids circulated between the catalytic surfaces can also be helpful. A constant flow of about 2-8 mL/cm2 per sec can be used, with typical mesh electrode distances 2 cm apart in large tanks. This flow can be maintained, in part, by the convective flow of gasses released from the electrodes during electrolysis. The mixed solution, chilled or not, can then undergo electrochemical processing through the use of at least one electrode in an electrolyzing step 1 10 of Figure 1. Each electrode can be or include a conductive metal. Metals can include, but are not limited to copper, aluminum, titanium, rhodium, platinum, silver, gold, iron, a combination thereof or an alloy such as steel or brass. The electrode can be coated or plated with a different metal such as, but not limited to aluminum, gold, platinum or silver. In an embodiment, each electrode is formed of titanium and plated with platinum. The platinum surfaces on the electrodes by themselves can be optimal to catalyze the required reactions. Rough, double layered platinum plating can assure that local "reaction centers" (sharply pointed extrusions) are active and that the reactants not make contact with the underlying electrode titanium substrate. In one embodiment, rough platinum-plated mesh electrodes in a vertical, coaxial, cylindrical geometry can be optimal, with, for example, not more than 2.5 cm, not more than 5 cm, not more than 10 cm, not more than 20 cm, or not more than 50 cm separation between the anode and cathode. The current run through each electrode can be between about 2 amps and about 15 amps, between about 4 amps and about 14 amps, at least about 2 amps, at least about 4 amps, at least about 6 amps, or any range created using any of these values. In one embodiment, 7 amps is used with each electrode. In one example, 1 amp is run through the electrodes. In one example, 2 amps are run through the electrodes. In one example, 3 amps are run through the electrodes. In one example, 4 amps are run through the electrodes. In one example, 5 amps are run through the electrodes. In one example, 6 amps are run through the electrodes. In one example, 7 amps are run through the electrodes. In a preferred example, 3 amps are run through the electrodes. The current can be running through the electrodes for a sufficient time to electrolyze the saline solution. The solution can be chilled during the electrochemical process. The solution can also be mixed during the electrochemical process. This mixing can be performed to ensure substantially complete electrolysis. Electric fields between the electrodes can cause movement of ions. Negative ions can move toward the anode and positive ions toward the cathode. This can enable exchange of reactants and products between the electrodes. In some embodiments, no barriers are needed between the electrodes. After current has been run through the solution for a sufficient time, an electrolyzed solution is created. The solution can be stored and or tested for particular properties in storage/testing step 1 12 of Figure 1. In one embodiment, the homogenous saline solution is chilled to about 4.8±0.5°C. Temperature regulation during the entire electro-catalytic process is typically required as thermal energy generated from the electrolysis process itself may cause heating. In one embodiment, process temperatures at the electrodes can be constantly cooled and maintained at about 4.8°C throughout electrolysis. After current has been run through the solution for a sufficient time, an electrolyzed solution is created with beneficial properties, such as antifungal properties. The solution can have a pH of about 7.4. In some embodiments, the pH is greater than 7.3. In some embodiments, the pH is not acidic. In other embodiments, the solution can have a pH less than about 7.5. The pH may not be basic. The solution can be stored and or tested for particular properties in a storage/testing step 1 12 of Figure 1. The end products of this electrolytic process can react within the saline solution to produce many different chemical entities. The compositions and composition described herein can include one or more of these chemical entities, known as redox signaling agents or RXNs. The chlorine concentration of the electrolyzed solution can be between about 5 ppm and about 34 ppm, between about 10 ppm and about 34 ppm, or between about 15 ppm and about 34 ppm. In one embodiment, the chlorine concentration is about 32 ppm. The saline concentration in the electrolyzed solution can be, for example, between about 0.10% w/v and about 0.20% w/v, between about 0.1 1 % w/v and about 0.19% w/v, between about 0.12% w/v and about 0.18% w/v, between about 0.13% w/v and about 0.17% w/v, or between about 0.14% w/v and about 0.16% w/v. The composition can then be bottled in a bottling step 1 14 of Figure 1 . The composition can be bottled in plastic bottles having volumes of about 4 oz, about 8 oz, about 16 oz, about 32 oz, about 48 oz, about 64 oz, about 80 oz, about 96 oz, about 1 12 oz, about 128 oz, about 144 oz, about 160 oz, or any range created using any of these values. The plastic bottles can also be plastic squeezable pouches having similar volumes. In one embodiment, plastic squeezable pouches can have one way valves to prevent leakage of the composition, for example, during athletic activity. During bottling, solution from an approved batch can be pumped through a 10 micron filter (e.g., polypropylene) to remove any larger particles from tanks, dust, hair, etc. that might have found their way into the batch. In other embodiments, this filter need not be used. Then, the solution can be pumped into the bottles, the overflow going back into the batch. Bottles generally may not contain any dyes, metal specks or chemicals that can be dissolved by acids or oxidating agents. The bottles, caps, bottling filters, valves, lines and heads used can be specifically be rated for acids and oxidating agents. Caps and with organic glues, seals or other components sensitive to oxidation may be avoided , as these could neutralize and weaken the product over time. The bottles and pouches used herein can aid in preventing decay of free radical species found within the compositions. In other embodiments, the bottles and pouches described do not further the decay process. In other words, the bottles and pouches used can be inert with respect to the radical species in the composition s. In one embodiment, a container (e.g ., bottle and/or pouch) can allow less than about 10% decay/month, less than about 9% decay/month, less than about 8% decay/month, less than about 7% decay/month, less than about 6% decay/month, less than about 5% decay/month, less than about 4% decay/month, less than about 3% decay/month, less than about 2% decay/month, less than about 1 % decay/month, between about 10% decay/month and about 1 % decay/month, between about 5% decay/month and about 1 % decay/month, about 10% decay/month, about 9% decay/month, about 8% decay/month, about 7% decay/month, about 6% decay/month, about 5% decay/month, about 4% decay/month, about 3% decay/month, about 2% decay/month, or about 1 % decay/month of free radicals in the composition . In one embodiment, a bottle can only result in about 3% decay/month of superoxide. In another embodiment, a pouch can only result in about 4% decay/month of superoxide. A direct current, DC, power source is used to electrolyze water. The variables of voltage, amps, frequency, time and current required depend on the compound and /or ion themselves and their respective bond strengths. To that end, the variables of voltage, amps, frequency, time and current are compound and /or ion dependent and are not limiting factors. That notwithstanding, the voltage used can be less than 40V, such as 30V or 20V or 10V or any voltage in between. The voltage can also modulate and at any time vary within a range of from 1 to 40V or from 10 to 30V or from 20 to 30V. In one embodiment, the voltage can range during a single cycle of electrolyzing . The range can be from 1 to 40V or from 10 to 30V or from 20 to 30V. These ranges are non-limiting but are shown as examples. Waveforms with an AC ripple also referred to as pulse or spiking waveforms include: any positive pulsing currents such as pulsed waves, pulse train, square wave, sawtooth wave, spiked waveforms, pulse-width modulation (PWM), pulse duration modulation (PDM), single phase half wave rectified AC, single phase full wave rectified AC or three phase full wave rectified for example. A bridge rectifier may be used. Other types of rectifiers can be used such as Single-phase rectifiers, Full-wave rectifiers, Three-phase rectifiers, Twelve-pulse bridge, Voltage-multiplying rectifiers, filter rectifier, a silicon rectifier, an SCR type rectifier, a high- frequency (RF) rectifier, an inverter digital-controller rectifier, vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc valves, solid-state diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers and the like. Pulsed waveforms can be made with a transistor regulated power supply, a dropper type power supply, a switching power supply and the like. A transformer may be used . Examples of transformers that can be used include center tapped transformers, Autotransformer, Capacitor voltage transformer, Distribution transformer, power transformer, Phase angle regulating transformer, Scott-T transformer, Polyphase transformer, Grounding transformer, Leakage transformer, Resonant transformer, Audio transformer, Output transformer, Laminated core Toroidal Autotransformer, Variable autotransformer, Induction regulator, Stray field transformer, Polyphase transformer, Grounding transformer, Leakage transformers, Resonant transformer, Constant voltage transformer, Ferrite core Planar transformer Oil cooled transformer, Cast resin transformer, Isolating transformer, Instrument transformer, Current transformer, Potential transformer Pulse transformer transformer Air-core transformer, Ferrite-core transformer, Transmission-line transformer, Balun Audio transformer, Loudspeaker transformer, Output transformer, Small signal transformer, Interstage coupling transformers, Hedgehog or Variocoupler. Pulsing potentials in the power supply of the production units can also be built in. Lack of filter capacitors in the rectified power supply can cause the voltages to drop to zero 120 times per second, resulting in a hard spike when the alternating current in the house power lines changes polarity. This hard spike, under Fourier transform, can emit a large bandwidth of frequencies. In essence, the voltage is varying from high potential to zero 120 times a second. In other embodiments, the voltage can vary from high potential to zero about 1 ,000 times a second, about 500 times a second , about 200 times a second, about 150 times a second, about 120 times a second, about 100 times a second, about 80 times a second, about 50 times a second , about 40 times a second , about 20 times a second, between about 200 times a second and about 20 times a second, between about 150 times a second and about 100 times a second , at least about 100 times a second, at least about 50 times a second , or at least about 120 times a second. This power modulation can allow the electrodes sample all voltages and also provides enough frequency bandwidth to excite resonances in the forming molecules themselves. The time at very low voltages can also provide an environment of low electric fields where ions of similar charge can come within close proximity to the electrodes. All of these factors together can provide a possibility for the formation of stable complexes capable of generating and preserving ROS free radicals. Waveforms with an alternating current (AC) ripple can be used to provide power to the electrodes. Such an AC ripple can also be referred to as pulse or spiking waveforms and include: any positive pulsing currents such as pulsed waves, pulse train, square wave, sawtooth wave, pulse-width modulation (PWM), pulse duration modulation (PDM), single phase half wave rectified AC, single phase full wave rectified AC or three phase full wave rectified for example. A bridge rectifier may be used. Other types of rectifiers can be used such as Single-phase rectifiers, Full-wave rectifiers, Three-phase rectifiers, Twelve-pulse bridge, Voltage-multiplying rectifiers, filter rectifier, a silicon rectifier, an SCR type rectifier, a high- frequency (RF) rectifier, an inverter digital-controller rectifier, vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc valves, solid-state diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers and the like. Pulsed waveforms can be made with a transistor regulated power supply, a dropper type power supply, a switching power supply and the like. This pulsing waveform model can be used to stabilize superoxides, hydroxyl radicals and OOH* from many different components and is not limited to any particular variable such as voltage, amps, frequency, flux (current density) or current. The variables are specific to the components used. For example, water and NaCI can be combined which provide molecules and ions in solution. A 60Hz current can be used, meaning that there are 60 cycles/120 spikes in the voltage (V) per second or 120 times wherein the V is 0 each second. When the V goes down to 0 it is believe that the 0 V allows for ions to drift apart/migrate and reorganize before the next increase in V. It is theorized that this spiking in V allows for and promotes a variable range of frequencies influencing many different types of compounds and/or ions so that this process occurs. In one embodiment, periodic moments of 0 volts are required. Again, when the V goes down to 0 it is believe that the 0 V allows for ions to drift apart/migrate and reorganize before the next increase in V. Therefore, without being bound to theory, it is believed that this migration of ions facilitates the 1 st, 2nd, and 3rd generations of species as shown in Figure 2. Stabilized superoxides, such as 02*-, are produced by this method. In another embodiment, the V is always either 0 V or a positive potential. Diodes may also be used. The V may drop to 0 as many times per second as the frequency is adjusted. As the frequency is increased the number of times the V drops is increased. When the ions are affected by the electricity from the electrodes, they change. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the electricity alters the state of some of the ions/compounds. This alteration results in the pushing of electrons out of their original orbit and/or spin state into a higher energy state and/or a single spin state. This electrolysis provides the energy to form free radicals which are ultimately formed during a multi-generational cycling of reactants and products during the electrolysis process. In other words, compounds and/or ions are initially electrolyzed so that the products that are formed are then themselves reacted with other compounds and/or ions and/or gas to form a second generation of reactants and products. This generational process then happens again so that the products from the second generation react with other compounds and/or ions in solution when the voltage spikes again. The redox potential can be about 840mV. The frequency can be from 1 Hz to infinity or to 100MHz. Preferably, the frequency is from 20Hz to 100Hz. More preferably, the frequency is from 40Hz to 80Hz. Most preferably, the frequency is 60Hz. In another embodiment, the frequency changes during the course of the electrolyzing process. For example, the frequency at any given moment is in the range from 20Hz to 100Hz. In another more preferred embodiment, the frequency at any given moment is in the range from 40Hz to 80Hz. Again referencing Figure 2, Figure 2 illustrates an example diagram of the generation of various molecules at the electrodes, the molecules written between the electrodes depict the initial reactants and those on the outside of the electrodes depict the molecules/ions produced at the electrodes and their electrode potentials. The diagram is broken into generations where each generation relies on the products of the subsequent generations. The end products of this electrolytic process can react within the saline solution to produce many different chemical entities.

In some embodiments, hydroxyl radicals can be stabilized in the composition by the formation of radical complexes. The radical complexes can be held together by hydrogen bonding. Another radical that can be present in the composition is an OOH* radical. Still other radical complexes can include a nitroxyl-peroxide radical (HNO-HOO*) and/or a hypochlorite-peroxide radical (HOCI-HOO*). Stable oxygen radicals can remain stable for about 3 months, about 6 months, about 9 months, about 12 months, about 15 months, about 18 months, about 21 months, between about 9 months and about 15 months, between about 12 months and about 18 months, at least about 9 months, at least about 12 months, at least about 15 months, at least about 18 months, about 24 months, about 30 months, about 50 months, about 100 months, about 200 months, about 300 months, about 400 months, about 500 months, about 1000 months, about 2000 months, or longer. Stable oxygen radicals can be substantially stable. Substantially stable can mean that the stable oxygen radical can remain at a concentration greater than about 75% relative to the concentration on day 1 , greater than about 80%, greater than about 85%, greater than about 90%, greater than about 95%, greater than about 96%, greater than about 97%, greater than about 98%, or greater than about 99% over a given time period as described above. For example, in one embodiment, the stable oxygen is at a concentration greater than about 95% relative to day 1 for at least 1 year. In another embodiment, the at least one oxygen radical is at a concentration greater than about 98% for at least 1 year. Stable can mean that the stable oxygen radical can remain at a concentration greater than about 75% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced, greater than about 80% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced, greater than about 85% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced, greater than about 90% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced, greater than about 95% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced, greater than about 96% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced, greater than about 97% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced, greater than about 98% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced, or greater than about 99% relative to the concentration on day 1 or the day is was produced over a given time period as described above. For example, in one embodiment, the stable oxygen is at a concentration greater than about 95% relative to day 1 for at least 1 year. In another embodiment, the at least one oxygen radical is at a concentration greater than about 98% for at least 1 year. Stability as used herein can also refer to the amount of a particular specie when compared to a reference sample. In some embodiments, the reference sample can be made in 1 L vessels with 0.9% isotonic solution electrolyzed with 3 Amps at 40°F, for 3 mins. In another embodiment, the reference sample can be made according to a process as otherwise described herein. The reference standard can also be bottle directly off the processing line as a "fresh" sample. In other embodiments, the at least one oxygen radical is greater than about 86% stable for at least 4 years, greater than about 79% stable for at least 6 years, greater than about 72% stable for at least 8 years, greater than about 65% stable for at least 10 years, or 100% stable for at least 20 years. In still other embodiments, the at least one oxygen radical is greater than about 95% stable for at least 2 years, at least 3 years, at least 4 years, at least 5 years, at least 6 years, at least 7 years, at least 8 years, at least 9 years, at least 10 years, at least 15 years, or at least 20 years. In still other embodiments, the at least one oxygen radical is greater than about 96% stable for at least 2 years, at least 3 years, at least 4 years, at least 5 years, at least 6 years, at least 7 years, at least 8 years, at least 9 years, at least 10 years, at least 15 years, or at least 20 years. In still other embodiments, the at least one oxygen radical is greater than about 97% stable for at least 2 years, at least 3 years, at least 4 years, at least 5 years, at least 6 years, at least 7 years, at least 8 years, at least 9 years, at least 10 years, at least 15 years, or at least 20 years. In still other embodiments, the at least one oxygen radical is greater than about 98% stable for at least 2 years, at least 3 years, at least 4 years, at least 5 years, at least 6 years, at least 7 years, at least 8 years, at least 9 years, at least 10 years, at least 15 years, or at least 20 years. In still other embodiments, the at least one oxygen radical is greater than about 99% stable for at least 2 years, at least 3 years, at least 4 years, at least 5 years, at least 6 years, at least 7 years, at least 8 years, at least 9 years, at least 10 years, at least 15 years, or at least 20 years. In still other embodiments, the at least one oxygen radical is 100% stable for at least 2 years, at least 3 years, at least 4 years, at least 5 years, at least 6 years, at least 7 years, at least 8 years, at least 9 years, at least 10 years, at least 15 years, or at least 20 years. The stability of oxygen radicals can also be stated as a decay rate over time. Substantially stable can mean a decay rate less than about 1 % per month, less than about 2% per month, less than about 3% per month, less than about 4% per month, less than about 5% per month, less than about 6% per month, less than about 10% per month, less than about 3% per year, less than about 4% per year, less than about 5% per year, less than about 6% per year, less than about 7% per year, less than about 8% per year, less than about 9% per year, less than about 10% per year, less than about 15% per year, less than about 20% per year, less than about 25% per year, between less than about 3% per month and less than about 7% per year. In other embodiments, stability can be expressed as a half-life. A half-life of the stable oxygen radical can be about 6 months, about 1 year, about 2 years, about 3 years, about 4 years, about 5 years, about 10 years, about 15 years, about 20 years, about 24 years, about 30 years, about 40 years, about 50 years, greater than about 1 year, greater than about 2 years, greater than about 10 years, greater than about 20 years, greater than about 24 years, between about 1 year and about 30 years, between about 6 years and about 24 years, or between about 12 years and about 30 years. Reactive species' concentrations in the life enhancing solutions, detected by fluorescence photo spectroscopy, may not significantly decrease in time. Mathematical models show that bound HOCI-O2- complexes are possible at room temperature. Molecular complexes can preserve volatile components of reactive species. For example, reactive species concentrations in whole blood as a result of molecular complexes may prevent reactive species degradation over time. Reactive species can be further divided into "reduced species" (RS) and "reactive oxygen species" (ROS). Reactive species can be formed from water molecules and sodium chloride ions when restructured through a process of forced electron donation. Electrons from lower molecular energy configurations in the salinated water may be forced into higher, more reactive molecular configurations. The species from which the electron was taken can be "electron hungry" and is called the RS and can readily become an electron acceptor (or proton donor) under the right conditions. The species that obtains the high-energy electron can be an electron donor and is called the ROS and may energetically release these electrons under the right conditions. When an energetic electron in ROS is unpaired it is called a "radical". ROS and RS can recombine to neutralize each other by the use of a catalytic enzyme. Three elements, (1 ) enzymes, (2) electron acceptors, and (3) electron donors can all be present at the same time and location for neutralization to occur. Depending on the parameters used to produce the composition , different components can be present at different concentrations. In one embodiment, the composition can include about 0.1 ppt, about 0.5 ppt, about 1 ppt, about 1.5 ppt, about 2 ppt, about 2.5 ppt, about 3 ppt, about 3.5 ppt, about 4 ppt, about 4.5 ppt, about 5 ppt, about 6 ppt, about 7 ppt, about 8 ppt, about 9 ppt, about 10 ppt, about 20 ppt, about 50 ppt, about 100 ppt, about 200 ppt, about 400 ppt, about 1 ,000 ppt, between about 0.1 ppt and about 1 ,000 ppt, between about 0.1 ppt and about 100 ppt, between about 0.1 ppt and about 10 ppt, between about 2 ppt and about 4 ppt, at least about 0.1 ppt, at least about 2 ppt, at least about 3 ppt, at most about 10 ppt, or at most about 100 ppt of OCI-. In some embodiments, OCI- can be present at about 3 ppt. In other embodiments, OCI- can be the predominant chlorine containing species in the composition. In order to determine the relative concentrations and rates of production of each of these during electrolysis, certain general chemical principles can be helpful: 1 ) A certain amount of Gibbs free energy is required for construction of the molecules; Gibbs free energy is proportional to the differences in electrode potentials listed in Figure 2. Reactions with large energy requirements are less likely to happen, for example an electrode potential of -2.71V (compared to Hydrogen reduction at 0.00V) is required to make sodium metal: Na+ + 1 e- - Na(s) Such a large energy difference requirement makes this reaction less likely to happen compared to other reactions with smaller energy requirements. Electron(s) from the electrodes may be preferentially used in the reactions that require lesser amounts of energy, such as the production of hydrogen gas. 2) Electrons and reactants are required to be at the same micro-locality on the electrodes. Reactions that require several reactants may be less likely to happen, for example: CI2 + 6H20 - 10e- + 2CI03- + 12H+ requires that 6 water molecules and a CI2 molecule to be at the electrode at the same point at the same time and a release of 10 electrons to simultaneously occur. The probability of this happening generally is smaller than other reactions requiring fewer and more concentrated reactants to coincide, but such a reaction may still occur. 3) Reactants generated in preceding generations can be transported or diffuse to the electrode where reactions happen. For example, dissolved oxygen (02) produced on the anode from the first generation can be transported to the cathode in order to produce superoxides and hydrogen peroxide in the second generation. Ions can be more readily transported: they can be pulled along by the electric field due to their electric charge. In order for chlorates, to be generated, for example, HCI02 can first be produced to start the cascade, restrictions for HCI02 production can also restrict any subsequent chlorate production. Lower temperatures can prevent HCI02 production. Stability and concentration of the above products can depend, in some cases substantially, on the surrounding environment. The formation of complexes and water clusters can affect the lifetime of the moieties, especially the free radicals. In a pH-neutral aqueous solution (pH around 7.0) at room temperature, superoxide free radicals (02*-) have a half-life of 10's of milliseconds and dissolved ozone (03) has a half-life of about 20 min. Hydrogen peroxide (H202) is relatively long- lived in neutral aqueous environments, but this can depend on redox potentials and UV light. Other entities such as HCI and NaOH rely on acidic or basic environments, respectively, in order to survive. In pH-neutral solutions, H+ and OH- ions have concentrations of approximately 1 part in 10,000,000 in the bulk aqueous solution away from the electrodes. H- and 10 can react quickly. The stability of most of these moieties mentioned above can depend on their microenvironment. Superoxides and ozone can form stable Van de Waals molecular complexes with hypochlorites. Clustering of polarized water clusters around charged ions can also have the effect of preserving hypochlorite-superoxide and hypochlorite-ozone complexes. Such complexes can be built through electrolysis on the molecular level on catalytic substrates, and may not occur spontaneously by mixing together components. Hypochlorites can also be produced spontaneously by the reaction of dissolved chlorine gas (CI2) and water. As such, in a neutral saline solution the formation of on or more of the stable molecules and complexes may exist: dissolved gases: 02, H2, CI2; hypochlorites: OCI-, HOCI, NaOCI; hypochlorates: HCI02, CI02, HCI03, HCI04; hydrogen peroxide: H202; ions: Na+, CI-, H+, H-, OH-; ozone: 03, 04*-; singlet oxygen: 10; hydroxyl free radical: OH*-; superoxide complexes: HOCI-02*-; and ozone complexes: HOCI-03. One or more of the above molecules can be found within the compositions and composition described herein. A complete quantum chemical theory can be helpful because production is complicated by the fact that different temperatures, electrode geometries, flows and ion transport mechanisms and electrical current modulations can materially change the relative/absolute concentrations of these components, which could result in producing different distinct compositions. As such, the selection of production parameters can be critical. The amount of time it would take to check all the variations experimentally may be prohibitive.

One skilled in the art understands that changes can be made to the system to alter the composition, and these changes are within the scope of the present description. Incoming water 202 can be subjected to reverse osmosis system 204 at a temperature of about 15-20°C to achieve purified water 206 with about 8 ppm of total dissolved solids. Purified water 206, is then fed at a temperature of about 15-20°C into distiller 208 and processed to achieve distilled water 210 with about 0.5 ppm of total dissolved solids. Distilled water 210 can then be stored in tank 212. Figure 4 illustrates an example system for preparing water for further processing into a therapeutic composition. System 300 can include a water source 302 which can feed directly into a carbon filter 304. After oils, alcohols, and other volatile chemical residuals and particulates are removed by carbon filter 304, the water can be directed to resin beds within a water softener 306 which can remove dissolved minerals. Then, as described above, the water can pass through reverse osmosis system 204 and distiller 208. Referring again to Figure 3, distilled water 210 can be gravity fed as needed from tank 212 into saline storage tank cluster 214 using line 216. Saline storage tank cluster 214 in one embodiment can include twelve tanks 218. Each tank 218 can be filled to about 1 ,300 gallons with distilled water 210. A handheld meter can be used to test distilled water 210 for salinity. Saline storage tank cluster 214 is then salted using a brine system 220. Brine system 220 can include two brine tanks 222. Each tank can have a capacity of about 500 gallons. Brine tanks 222 are filled to 475 gallons with distilled water 210 using line 224 and then NaCI is added to the brine tanks 222 at a ratio of about 537.5 g/gal of liquid. At this point, the water is circulated 226 in the brine tanks 222 at a rate of about 2,000 gal/hr for about 4 days. Prior to addition of brine to tanks 218, the salinity of the water in tanks 218 can be tested using a handheld conductivity meter such as an YSI ECOSENSE® ecp300 (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). Any corrections based on the salinity measurements can be made at this point. Brine solution 228 is then added to tanks 218 to achieve a salt concentration of about 10.75 g/gal. The salted water is circulated 230 in tanks 218 at a rate of about 2,000 gal/hr for no less than about 72 hours. This circulation is performed at room temperature. A handheld probe can again be used to test salinity of the salinated solution. In one embodiment, the salinity is about 2.8 ppth. In one method for filling and mixing the salt water in the brine holding tanks, the amount of liquid remaining in the tanks is measured. The amount of liquid remaining in a tank is measured by recording the height that the liquid level is from the floor that sustains the tank, in centimeters, and referencing the number of gallons this height represents. This can be done from the outside of the tank if the tank is semi-transparent. The initial liquid height in both tied tanks can also be measured. Then, after ensuring that the output valve is closed, distilled water can be pumped in. The amount of distilled water that is being pumped into a holding tank can then be calculated by measuring the rise in liquid level: subtracting the initial height from the filled height and then multiplying this difference by a known factor. The amount of salt to be added to the tank is then calculated by multiplying 1 1 grams of salt for every gallon of distilled water that has been added to the tank. The salt can be carefully weighed out and dumped into the tank. The tank is then agitated by turning on the recirculation pump and then opening the top and bottom valves on the tank. Liquid is pumped from the bottom of the tank to the top. The tank can be agitated for three days before it may be ready to be processed. After agitating the tank for more than 6 hours, the salinity is checked with a salinity meter by taking a sample from the tank and testing it. Salt or water can be added to adjust the salinity within the tanks. If either more water or more salt is added then the tanks are agitated for 6 more hours and tested again. After about three days of agitation, the tank is ready to be processed. Salinated water 232 is then transferred to cold saline tanks 234. In one embodiment, four 250 gal tanks are used. The amount of salinated water 232 moved is about 1 ,000 gal. A chiller 236 such as a 16 ton chiller is used to cool heat exchangers 238 to about 0-5°C. The salinated water is circulated 240 through the heat exchangers which are circulated with propylene glycol until the temperature of the salinated water is about 4.5-5.8°C. Chilling the 1 ,000 gal of salinated water generally takes about 6-8 hr. Cold salinated water 242 is then transferred to processing tanks 244. In one embodiment, eight tanks are used and each can have a capacity of about 180 gal. Each processing tank 244 is filled to about 125 gal for a total of 1 ,000 gal. Heat exchangers 246 are again used to chill the cold salinated water 242 added to processing tanks 244. Each processing tank can include a cylinder of chilling tubes and propylene glycol can be circulated. The heat exchangers can be powered by a 4-5 ton chiller 248. The temperature of cold salinated water 242 can remain at 4.5-5.8°C during processing. Prior to transferring aged salt water to processing tanks, the aged salt water can be agitated for about 30 minutes to sufficiently mix the aged salt water. Then, the recirculation valves can then be closed, the appropriate inlet valve on the production tank is opened, and the tank filled so that the salt water covers the cooling coils and comes up to the fill mark (approximately 125 gallons). Once the aged salt water has reached production temperature, the pump is turned off but the chiller left on. The tank should be adequately agitated or re-circulated during the whole duration of electrochemical processing and the temperature should remain constant throughout. Each processing tank 244 includes electrode 250. Electrodes 250 can be 3 inches tall circular structures formed of titanium and plated with platinum. Electrochemical processing of the cold salinated water can be run for 8 hr. A power supply 252 is used to power the eight electrodes (one in each processing tank 244) to 7 amps each for a total of 56 amps. The cold salinated water is circulated 254 during electrochemical processing at a rate of about 1 ,000 gal/hr. An independent current meter can be used to set the current to around 7.0 Amps. Attention can be paid to ensure that the voltage does not exceed 12V and does not go lower than 9V. Normal operation can be about 10V. A run timer can be set for a prescribed time (about 4.5 to 5 hours). Each production tank can have its own timer and/or power supply. Electrodes should be turned off after the timer has expired. The production tanks can be checked periodically. The temperature and/or electrical current can be kept substantially constant. At the beginning, the electrodes can be visible from the top, emitting visible bubbles. After about 3 hours, small bubbles of undissolved oxygen can start building up in the tank as oxygen saturation occurs, obscuring the view of the electrodes. A slight chlorine smell can be normal. After the 8 hour electrochemical processing is complete, life enhancing water 256 has been created with a pH of about 6.8-8.2 and 32 ppm of chlorine. The composition 256 is transferred to storage tanks 258. The product ASEA can be made by this process. Preferably, the product ASEA is made by the process of this Example 1. Example 2 Characterization of a solution produced as described in Example 1 A composition produced as described in Example 1 was analyzed using a variety of different characterization techniques. ICP/MS and 35CI NMR were used to analyze and quantify chlorine content. Headspace mass spectrometry analysis was used to analyze adsorbed gas content in the composition. 1 H NMR was used to verify the organic matter content in the composition. 31 P NMR and EPR experiments utilizing spin trap molecules were used to explore the composition for free radicals. The composition was received and stored at about 4°C when not being used. Chlorine NMR Sodium hypochlorite solutions were prepared at different pH values. 5% sodium hypochlorite solution had a pH of 12.48. Concentrated nitric acid was added to 5% sodium hypochlorite solution to create solutions that were at pH of 9.99, 6.99, 5.32, and 3.28. These solutions were then analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The composition had a measured pH of 8.01 and was analyzed directly by NMR with no dilutions. NMR spectroscopy experiments were performed using a 400 MHz Bruker spectrometer equipped with a BBO probe. 35CI NMR experiments were performed at a frequency of 39.2 MHz using single pulse experiments. A recycle delay of 10 seconds was used, and 128 scans were acquired per sample. A solution of NaCI in water was used as an external chemical shift reference. All experiments were performed at room temperature. 35CI NMR spectra were collected for NaCI solution, NaCIO solutions adjusted to different pH values, and the composition. Figure 5 illustrates a CI35 spectrum of NaCI, NaCIO solution at a pH of 12.48, and the composition. The chemical shift scale was referenced by setting the CI- peak to 0 ppm. NaCIO solutions above a pH=7 had identical spectra with a peak at approximately 5.1 ppm. Below pH of 7.0, the CIO- peak disappeared and was replaced by much broader, less easily identifiable peaks. The composition was presented with one peak at approximately 4.7 ppm, from CIO- in the composition. This peak was integrated to estimate the concentration of CIO- in the composition, which was determined to be 2.99 ppt or 0.17 M of CIO- in the composition. Proton NMR An ASEA sample was prepared by adding 550 [it of ASEA and 50 [it of D20 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) to an NMR tube and vortexing the sample for 10 seconds. 1 H NMR experiments were performed on a 700 MHz Bruker spectrometer equipped with a QNP cryogenically cooled probe. Experiments used a single pulse with pre-saturation on the water resonance experiment. A total of 1024 scans were taken. All experiments were performed at room temperature. A 1 H NMR spectrum of the composition was determined and is presented in Figure 6. Only peaks associated with water were able to be distinguished from this spectrum. This spectrum show that very little if any organic material can be detected in the composition using this method. Phosphorous NMR and Mass Spectrometry DIPPMPO (5-(Diisopropoxyphosphoryl)-5-1 -pyrroline-N-oxide) (VWR) samples were prepared by measuring about 5 mg of DIPPMPO into a 2 mL centrifuge tube. This tube then had 550 [it of either the composition or water added to it, followed by 50 [it of D20. A solution was also prepared with the composition but without DIPPMPO. These solutions were vortexed and transferred to NMR tubes for analysis. Samples for mass spectrometry analysis were prepared by dissolving about 5 mg of DIPPMPO in 600 [it of the composition and vortexing, then diluting the sample by adding 100 [it of sample and 900 [it of water to a vial and vortexing. NMR experiments were performed using a 700 MHz Bruker spectrometer equipped with a QNP cryogenically cooled probe. Experiments performed were a single 30° pulse at a 31 P frequency of 283.4 MHz. A recycle delay of 2.5 seconds and 16384 scans were used. Phosphoric acid was used as an external standard. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Mass spectrometry experiments were performed by directly injecting the ASEA/DIPPMPO sample into a Waters/Synapt Time of Flight mass spectrometer. The sample was directly injected into the mass spectrometer, bypassing the LC, and monitored in both positive and negative ion mode. 31 P NMR spectra were collected for DIPPMPO in water, the composition alone, and the composition with DIPPMPO added to it. An external reference of phosphoric acid was used as a chemical shift reference. Figure 7 illustrates a 31 P NMR spectrum of DIPPMPO combined with the composition. The peak at 21.8 ppm was determined to be DIPPMPO and is seen in both the spectrum of DIPPMPO with the composition (Figure 7) and without the composition (not pictured). The peak at 24.9 ppm is most probably DIPPMPO/ΟΗ· as determined in other DIPPMPO studies. This peak may be seen in DIPPMPO mixtures both with and without the composition, but is detected at a much greater concentration in the solution with the composition. In the DIPPMPO mixture with the composition, there is another peak at 17.9 ppm. This peak may be from another radical species in the composition such as ΟΟΗ· or possibly a different radical complex. The approximate concentrations of spin trap complexes in the composition /DIPPMPO solution are as follows: Mass spectral data was collected in an attempt to determine the composition of the unidentified radical species. The mass spectrum shows a parent peak and fragmentation pattern for DIPPMPO with m/z peaks at 264, 222, and 180, as seen in Figure 8. Figure 8 also shows peaks for the DIPPMPO/Na adduct and subsequent fragments at 286, 244, and 202 m/z. Finally, Figure 8 demonstrates peaks for one DIPPMPO/radical complex with m/z of 329. The negative ion mode mass spectrum also had a corresponding peak at m/z of 327. There are additional peaks at 349, 367, and 302 at a lower intensity as presented in Figure 8. None of these peaks could be positively confirmed. However, there are possible structures that would result in these mass patterns. One possibility for the peak generated at 329 could be a structure formed from a radical combining with DIPPMPO. Possibilities of this radical species include a nitroxyl- peroxide radical (HNO-HOO) that may have formed in the composition as a result of reaction with nitrogen from the air. Another peak at 349 could also be a result of a DIPPMPO/radical combination. Here, a possibility for the radical may be hypochlorite- peroxide (HOCI-HOO). However, the small intensity of this peak and small intensity of the corresponding peak of 347 in the negative ion mode mass spectrum indicate this could be a very low concentration impurity and not a compound present in the ASEA composition. ICP/MS Analysis Samples were analyzed on an Agilent 7500 series inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) in order to confirm the hypochlorite concentration that was determined by NMR. A stock solution of 5% sodium hypochlorite was used to prepare a series of dilutions consisting of 300 ppb, 150 ppb, 75 ppb, 37.5 ppb, 18.75 ppb, 9.375 ppb, 4.6875 ppb, 2.34375 ppb, and 1 .171875 ppb in deionized Milli-Q water. These standards were used to establish a standard curve. Based on NMR hypochlorite concentration data, a series of dilutions was prepared consisting of 164.9835 ppb, 82.49175 ppb, 41.245875 ppb, 20.622937 ppb, 10.31 1468 ppb, and 5.155734 ppb. These theoretical values were then compared with the values determined by ICP-MS analysis. The instrument parameters were as follows: The results of the ICP-MS analysis are as follows: Dilutions were compared graphically to the ICP-MS signals and fit to a linear equation (R2=0.9522). Assuming linear behavior of the ICP-MS signal, the concentration of hypochlorite in the composition was measured to be 3.02 ppt. Concentration values were determined by calculating the concentration of dilutions of the initial composition and estimating the initial composition hypochlorite concentration to be 3 ppt (as determined from 35CI NMR analysis). The ICP-MS data correlate well with the 35CI NMR data, confirming a hypochlorite concentration of roughly 1/3% (3 ppt). It should be noted that ICP-MS analysis is capable of measuring total chlorine atom concentration in solution, but not specific chlorine species. The NMR data indicate that chlorine predominantly exists as CIO- in the composition. Gas Phase Quadrupole MS Sample Prep Three sample groups were prepared in triplicate for the analysis: 1 ) Milli-Q deionized water 2) the composition, and 3) 5% sodium hypochlorite standard solution. The vials used were 20 mL headspace vials with magnetic crimp caps (GERSTEL). A small stir bar was placed in each vial (VWR) along with 10 mL of sample. The vials were capped , and then placed in a Branson model 5510 sonicator for one hour at 60°C. The sonicator was set to degas which allowed for any dissolved gasses to be released from the sample into the headspace. After degassing, the samples were placed on a CTC PAL autosampler equipped with a heated agitator and headspace syringe. The agitator was set to 750 rpm and 95°C and the syringe was set to 75°C. Each vial was placed in the agitator for 20 min prior to injection into the instrument. A headspace volume of 2.5 mL was collected from the vial and injected into the instrument. Instrument Parameters The instrument used was an Agilent 7890A GC system coupled to an Agilent 5975C EI/CI single quadrupole mass selective detector (MSD) set up for electron ionization. The GC oven was set to 40°C with the front inlet and the transfer lines being set to 150°C and 155°C respectively. The carrier gas used was helium and it was set to a pressure of 15 PSI . The MSD was set to single ion mode (SIM) in order to detect the following analytes: Analyte Mass Water 18 Nitrogen 28 Oxygen 32 Argon 40 Carbon 44 Dioxide Chlorine 70 Ozone 48 The ionization source temperature was set to 230°C and the quadrupole temperature was set to 150°C. The electron energy was set to 15 V. Mass spectrometry data was obtained from analysis of the gas phase headspace of the water, the composition, and hypochlorite solution. The raw area counts obtained from the mass spectrometer were normalized to the area counts of nitrogen in order to eliminate any systematic instrument variation. Both nitrogen and water were used as standards because they were present in equal volumes in the vial with nitrogen occupying the headspace and water being the solvent. It was assumed that the overall volume of water and nitrogen would be the same for each sample after degassing. In order for this assumption to be correct, the ratio of nitrogen to water should be the same for each sample. A cutoff value for the percent relative standard deviation (% RSD) of 5% was used. Across all nine samples, a % RSD of 4.2 was observed. Of note, sample NaCIO-3 appears to be an outlier, thus, when removed , the % RSD drops to 3.4%. Figures 9-1 1 illustrate oxygen/nitrogen, chlorine/nitrogen, and ozone/nitrogen ratios. It appears that there were less of these gases released from the composition than from either water or nitrogen. It should be noted that the signals for both ozone and chlorine were very weak. Thus, there is a possibility that these signals may be due to instrument noise and not from the target analytes. Figure 12 illustrates the carbon dioxide to nitrogen ratio. It appears that there may have been more carbon dioxide released from the composition than oxygen. However, it is possible that this may be due to background contamination from the atmosphere. Based on the above, more oxygen was released from both water and sodium hypochlorite than the composition. EPR Two different composition samples were prepared for EPR analysis. The composition with nothing added was one sample. The other sample was prepared by adding 31 mg of DIPPMPO to 20 mL of the composition (5.9mM), vortexing, and placing the sample in a 4°C refrigerator overnight. Both samples were placed in a small capillary tube which was then inserted into a normal 5 mm EPR tube for analysis. EPR experiments were performed on a Bruker EMX 10/12 EPR spectrometer. EPR experiments were performed at 9.8 GHz with a centerfield position of 3500 Gauss and a sweepwidth of 100 Gauss. A 20 mW energy pulse was used with modulation frequency of 100 kHz and modulation amplitude of 1 G. Experiments used 100 scans. All experiments were performed at room temperature. EPR analysis was performed on the composition with and without DIPPMPO mixed into the solution. Figure 13 shows the EPR spectrum generated from DIPPMPO mixed with the composition. The composition alone showed no EPR signal after 100 scans (not presented). Figure 13 illustrates an EPR splitting pattern for a free electron. This electron appears to be split by three different nuclei. The data indicate that this is a characteristic splitting pattern of ΟΗ· radical interacting with DMPO (similar to DIPPMPO). This pattern can be described by 14N splitting the peak into three equal peaks and 1 H three bonds away splitting that pattern into two equal triplets. If these splittings are the same, it leads to a quartet splitting where the two middle peaks are twice as large as the outer peaks. This pattern may be seen in Figure 13 twice, with the larger peaks at 3457 and 3471 for one quartet and 3504 and 3518 for the other quartet. In this case, the 14N splitting and the 1 H splitting are both roughly 14G, similar to an OH* radical attaching to DMPO. The two quartet patterns in Figure 13 are created by an additional splitting of 47G. This splitting is most likely from coupling to 31 P, and similar patterns have been seen previously. The EPR spectrum in Figure 13 indicates that there is a DIPPMPO/ΟΗ· radical species in the solution. Example 3 The electrolyzed fluid can be made in different types of vessels as long as the proper power sourced is used. One example of an apparatus that was used to make electrolyzed solution for treating fungal infections is that referred to in Figures 14-18. Referring first to Figure 14, which is a perspective view of a first presently preferred embodiment of the present application generally represented at 100, includes a power supply 102 and a fluid receptacle represented at 104. The fluid receptacle 104 includes a base 1 14 upon which is attached a fluid vessel 1 16. The base 1 14 can preferably be fabricated from an insulative plastic material. The fluid vessel 1 16 is preferably fabricated from an inert clear plastic material which is compatible with biological processes as available in the art. A lid 1 18 is provided to cover the fluid vessel 1 16 and keep contaminants out of the fluid vessel 1 16. A screen 120 is positioned to prevent foreign objects, which might accidentally fall into the fluid vessel 1 16, from falling to the bottom of the fluid vessel 1 16. The saline solution which is to be treated is placed into the fluid vessel 1 16, and the lid 1 18 placed, for the necessary period of time after which the electrolyzed saline solution can be withdrawn from the fluid vessel 1 16, for example into a syringe, for use. The fluid vessel 1 16 is sealed at its bottom by a floor 124 which is attached to the interior of the base 1 14. An electrode assembly, generally represented at 122, is attached to the floor 124 so that any fluid in the fluid vessel is exposed to the electrode assembly 122. The electrode assembly 122 is electrically connected to the power supply 102 via terminals 1 10 and 1 12 and cables 106 and 108, respectively. The power supply 102 should deliver a controlled voltage and current to the electrode assembly 122 when fluid is placed into the fluid vessel 1 16. The voltage and current applied to the electrode assembly 122 will vary according to the fluid being electrolyzed. A control for setting and measuring the voltage 102A and a control for setting and measuring the current 102B is provided in the power supply. In accordance with the present application, a low voltage of less than about 30 volts DC is used . Exemplary voltage and current values, and the advantages which accrue when using the preferred voltage and current values, will be explained shortly. Figure 15 is a top view of the electrode assembly 122 represented in Figure 14. The electrode assembly 122 preferably comprises a cylindrical inner electrode 128 and a cylindrical outer electrode 126. The inner electrode 128 is preferably solid or any hollow in the inner electrode is sealed so that fluid does not enter any such hollow. The cylindrical shape of the inner electrode 128 and the outer electrode 126 is preferred and results in better performance than obtained with electrodes of other shapes, e.g. , elongated flat panels. The diameter A of the inner electrode 128 is preferably about one-half inch but the diameter A of the inner electrode can be selected by those skilled in the art in accordance with the particular application for the electrode using the information contained herein. The outer electrode 126 should be of a generally cylindrical shape and preferably be fabricated from titanium or niobium having a thickness (indicated at B in Figure 15) which ensures that the inner electrode is shielded from potentially physical damage. As will be appreciated, titanium and niobium provide the advantage of resistance against corrosion which further prevents the introduction of harmful substances into the fluid being electrolyzed. Still referring to Figure 15, the space, indicated at C, between the inner electrode 128 and the outer electrode 126 does not exceed a maximum value. In contrast to previously available devices which separate the electrodes by greater distances and then utilize higher voltages to obtain the desired electrolyzation, the present application keeps the electrode spacing small and obtains improved performance over other schemes. It is preferred that the space between the inner electrode 128 and the outer electrode 126 be not more than about one-half (1/2) inch; it is more preferred that the space between the inner electrode 128 and the outer electrode 126 be not more than about three-eighths (3/8) inch; and, it is most preferred that the space between the inner electrode 128 and the outer electrode 126 be not more than about one-quarter (1 /4) inch. Reference will next be made to Figure 15A which is a side cross sectional view of the electrode assembly taken along line 3-3 in Figure 15. As seen in Figure 15A, the outer electrode 126 extends above the inner electrode 128 to provide improved electrical performance and physical protection. The outer electrode 126 is attached to the floor 124 by way of bolts 130, which extend through bores provided in the floor 124, and accompanying nuts. An electrical connection is made to the outer electrode 126 by a lead 136 attached to the bolt and nut. The lead 136 is attached to one of the terminals 1 10 or 1 12. Similarly, an electrical connection is made to the inner electrode 128 by a lead 134 which is held in place by a nut attached to a threaded stud extending from the bottom of the inner electrode and through a bore provided in the floor 124. The lead 134 is attached to the remaining one of the terminals 1 10 or 1 12. The leads 134 and 136 are kept insulated from any fluid which is present in the fluid vessel 1 16. It is preferred that the inner electrode 128 function as the anode while the outer electrode function as the cathode when electrolyzing fluids and the power supply 102 and the terminals 1 10 and 1 12 should be properly arranged to carry this out. It is recognized in the art that the anode is subject to destructive forces during electrolysis. In the prior art, the anode of an electrode assembly may dissolve to the point of being inoperative and may need to be replaced very often. Critically, as the anode of an electrode assembly dissolves, the metallic components of the anode are dispersed into the fluid. If the fluid is a saline solution which will be used to treat physiological fluids, toxic substances dispersed into the solution, such as the materials comprising the anode, may be harmful or dangerous to the person who expects to be benefitted from the treatment. Of all the possible materials for fabrication of the anode, the art recognizes that platinum is the least likely to be dissolved when used as an anode. Unfortunately, the cost of platinum precludes the use of an anode which consists entirely of platinum. Thus, it is common in the art to utilize another metal as a base for the anode with a layer of platinum being placed on surfaces which contact the fluid to be electrolyzed. The present application advantageously utilizes an inner electrode 128, i.e., an anode, which includes a base of titanium, and even more preferably niobium (also known as columbium), upon which a layer of platinum is provided wherever fluid contacts the anode. Significantly, niobium is a relatively good electrical conductor having a conductivity which is about three times greater than the conductivity of titanium. Moreover, if the base metal is exposed to the fluid, such as if a pinhole defect develops, toxic products are not produced by the contact between niobium and the fluid. Moreover, the high breakdown voltage in saline solution of the oxide which forms when a niobium base receives a layer of platinum provides further advantages of the present application. Upon a base of niobium, a layer of platinum is formed on the anode. The layer of platinum is preferably formed using a technique referred to in the art as brush electrodeposition which can be carried out by those skilled in the art using the information set forth herein. Other techniques can also be used to form the platinum layer, such as tank (immersion) electrodeposition, vapor deposition, and roll bonding, but brush electrodeposition is preferred because of its superior adhesion and resulting in less porosity than other economically comparable techniques. The thickness of the platinum layer is preferably greater than about 0.02 mils and is most preferably greater than about 0.06 mils, and up to about 0.20 mils. The combination of using niobium as a base for the anode of the electrode assembly and utilizing brush electrodeposition provides that the platinum layer can be much thinner than otherwise possible and still provide economical and reliable operation. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that even with an anode fabricated in accordance with the present application replacement of the anode, which preferably comprises the inner electrode 128 represented in Figure 15A, may be necessary after a period of use. The construction of the embodiments of the present application allows easy replacement of the inner electrode 128 and the outer electrode 126 when it becomes necessary. Represented in Figure 16 is a block diagram of a second presently preferred embodiment, generally represented at 150, of the present application. The embodiment represented in Figure 16 is particularly adapted for treating large quantities of saline solution. Represented in Figure 16 is a tank 152 in which the saline solution is electrolyzed. An electrode assembly 154 is provided in the tank and is preferably immersed into the solution. A power supply 158, capable of providing sufficient current at the proper voltage, is connected to the electrode assembly via a cable 160. Also represented in Figure 16 is a circulation device 156 which optionally functions to circulate the solution within the tank 152. A sensor 162 is also optionally provided to measure the progress of the electrolyzation of the solution in the tank 152, for example by measuring the pH of the solution. The sensor may preferably be an ion selective electrode which can be chosen from those available in the art. Other sensors, for example chlorine, ozone, and temperature sensors, may also be included within the scope of the present application. A control unit 164 is optionally provided to coordinate the operation of the power supply 158, the circulation device 156, and the sensor 162 in order to obtain the most efficient operation of the apparatus 150. It will be appreciated that devices such as power supply 158, circulation device 158, sensor 162, and control unit 164 can be readily obtained from sources in the industry and adapted for use with embodiments of the present application by those skilled in the art using the information contained herein. In particular, the control unit 164 is preferably a digital microprocessor based device accompanied by appropriate interfaces all allowing for accurate control of the operation of the apparatus 150. It is also within the scope of the present application to include structures to prevent contamination of the treated solution by contact with nonsterile surfaces and by airborne pathogens both during treatment and while the fluid is being transferred to the apparatus and being withdrawn from the apparatus. Reference will next be made to Figures 17 and 18 which are a top view and cross sectional view, respectively, of an electrode assembly, generally represented at 154, which is preferred for use in the apparatus represented in Figure 16. As can be seen best in Figure 17, the electrode assembly 154 includes a plurality of concentrically arranged anodes and cathodes. The cylindrical shape and concentric arrangement of the electrodes represented in Figure 17 provides for the most efficient operation. The number of electrodes which are included can be selected according to the application of the apparatus. For example, the number of electrodes may be six, seven, eight, the eleven represented in Figures 17 and 18, or more. In Figure 17, electrodes 170, 174, 178, 182, 186, and 190 preferably function as cathodes and are preferably fabricated in accordance with the principles set forth above in connection with the outer electrode represented at 126 in Figures 14-15A. Furthermore, in Figure 17 electrodes 172, 176, 180, 184, and 188 function as anodes and are preferably fabricated in accordance with the principles set forth above in connection with the inner electrode represented at 128 in Figures 14-15A. In the cross sectional side view of Figure 18 a plurality of tabs extend from the cylindrical electrodes 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182, 184, 186, and 190 to facilitate making an electrical connection thereto. Provided below in the following Table are the relationship between the tabs illustrated in Figure 18 and the electrodes. Using the tabs 170A, 172A, 174A, 176A, 178A, 180A, 182A, 184A, 186A, 188A, and 190A, those skilled in the art can provide the necessary electrical connections to the electrodes 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182, 184, 186, and 190 and can also provide numerous structures to prevent contact between the tabs and the fluid to be treated. Each of the tabs illustrated in Figure 18 are provided with an aperture, such as those represented at 172B, 176B, and 184B, which receive a wiring connector. While the apparatus described in Example 3 herein has many uses, the most preferred use of the apparatus described herein is subjecting sterile saline solution to electrolysis. The electrolyzed saline solution can then be used to treat a patient. The saline solution preferably has an initial concentration in the range from about 0.25% to about 1.0% NaCI which is about one-fourth to full strength of normal or isotonic saline solution. According to Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, E. A. Davis, Co. 1985 Ed., an "isotonic saline" is defined as a 0.16 M NaCI solution or one containing approximately 0.95% NaCI; a "physiological salt solution" is defined as a sterile solution containing 0.85% NaCI and is considered isotonic to body fluids and a "normal saline solution;" a 0.9% NaCI solution which is considered isotonic to the body. Therefore, the terms "isotonic," "normal saline," "balanced saline," or "physiological fluid" are considered to be a saline solution containing in the range from about 0.85% to about 0.95% NaCI. Moreover, in accordance with the present application, a saline solution may be subjected to electrolysis at concentrations in the range from about 0.15% to about 1.0%. It is preferred that one of the above described saline solutions be diluted with sterile distilled water to the desired concentration, preferably in the range from about 0.15% to about 0.35% prior to treatment in accordance with the present application. This dilute saline solution is subjected to electrolysis using the embodiments of the present application at a voltage, current, and time to produce an appropriately electrolyzed solution as will be described shortly. It is presently preferred to carry out the electrolysis reaction at ambient temperatures. In a more preferred embodiment the saline solution used with the apparatus of Example 3 is 9.1 gNaCI/1 L of water. In another preferred embodiment the saline solution used with the apparatus of Example 3 is 2. gNaCI/1 L of water. The voltage and current values provided herein are merely exemplary and the voltage and current values which are used, and the time the saline solution is subject to electrolysis, is determined by many variables, e.g., the surface area and efficiency of the particular electrode assembly and the volume and/or concentration of saline solution being electrolyzed. For electrode assemblies having a different surface area, greater volumes of saline solution, or higher concentrations of saline solutions the voltage, current, or time may be higher and/or longer than those exemplary values provided herein. In accordance with the present application, it is the generation of the desired concentration of ozone and active chlorine species which is important. Electrolyzation of the saline solution also results in other products of the electrolysis reaction including members selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, sodium and hydroxide ions. It will be appreciated that the interaction of the electrolysis products results in a solution containing bioactive atoms, radicals or ions selected from the group consisting of chlorine, ozone, hydroxide, hypochlorous acid, hypochlorite, peroxide, oxygen and perhaps others along with corresponding amounts of molecular hydrogen and sodium and hydrogen ions. According to Faraday's laws of electrolysis, the amount of chemical change produced by a current is proportional to the quantity of electrons passed through the material. Also, the amounts of different substances liberated by a given quantity of electrons are proportional to the chemical equivalent weights of those substances. Therefore, to generate an electrolyzed saline having the desired concentrations of ozone and active chlorine species from saline solutions having a saline concentration of less than about 1 .0%, voltage, current, and time parameters appropriate to the electrodes and solution are required to produce an electrolyzed solution containing in the range from about 5 to about 100 mg/L of ozone and a free chlorine content in the range from about 5 to about 300 ppm. For in vitro use these solutions can be utilized without further modification or they can be adjusted as desired with saline or other solutions. Prior to in vivo use, the resulting solution may be adjusted or balanced to an isotonic saline concentration with sufficient hypertonic saline, e.g. , 5% hypertonic saline solution. In general, the electrolyzed solutions produced using the apparatus described herein, which are referred to as microbicidal solutions, will have an ozone content in the range from about 5 to about 100 mg/L and an active chlorine species content in the range from about 5 to about 300 ppm. More preferably the ozone content will be in the range from about 5 to about 30 mg/L and the active chlorine species content will be in the range from about 10 to about 100 ppm. Most preferably the ozone content will be in the range from about 9 to about 15 mg/L and the active species content will be in the range from about 10 to about 80 ppm. By active chlorine species is meant the total chlorine concentration attributable to chlorine content detectable by a chlorine ion selective electrode and will be selected from the group consisting of chlorine, hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions or moieties. The pH of the solution is preferably in the range from about 7.2 to about 7.6 and, when used for intravenous administration, most preferably in the range from about 7.35 to about 7.45 which is the pH range of human blood. An effective amount of the resulting balanced microbicidal saline solution is administered by appropriate modes, e.g ., intravenously, orally, vaginally or rectally and may vary greatly according to the mode of administration, condition being treated , the size of the warm-blooded animal, etc. Particular dosages and methods of administration, as well as additional components to be administered, can be determined by those skilled in the art using the information set forth herein and set forth in the U.S. patent documents previously incorporated herein by reference. As explained in the cited U.S. patent documents, although it is known that electrolyzed saline solutions possess in vitro microbicidal activity it has long been thought that components in the electrolyzed solution, such as ozone and chlorine, are toxic to warm blooded animals and should not be utilized for in vivo purposes. It has now been found, however, that saline solutions, which have been subjected to electrolysis to produce finite amounts of ozone and active chlorine products, can be injected into the vascular system to create a reaction to assist in the removal, passivation, or destruction of a toxin. In order to arrive at the preferred end product, electrolyzed saline solution using the apparatus illustrated in Figures 14-15A, about a 0.33% (about one third physiologically normal) saline solution is placed in the fluid vessel 1 16 (Figure 14) and the apparatus is operated for about 5 to 15 minutes with a voltage between the electrodes being maintained in the range from about 10 volts to about 20 volts with a current flow maintained in the range from about 5 to about 20 amps. In one example, the cell described in Example 3 operated for 1 hour at 40C using 3 Amps with a saline solution of less than 0.35% saline. In one example, the cell described in Example 3 operated for 1 hour at 40C using 3 Amps with a saline solution of less than 1 .0% saline. In one example, the cell described in Example 3 operated for 3 minutes at 23C using 3 Amps with a saline solution of less than 0.35% saline. In one example, the cell described in Example 3 operated for 3 minutes at 23C using 3 Amps with a saline solution of less than 1.0% saline. As one example of the use of the embodiment of Figures 14-15A, a 0.225% saline solution is subjected to a current of 3 amperes at 20 volts (DC) for a period of three minutes. A 17 ml portion of this electrolyzed solution is aseptically diluted with 3 mis of a sterile 5% saline resulting in a finished isotonic electrolyzed saline having an active ozone content of 12. +-.2 mg/L and an active chlorine species content of 60. +-.4 ppm at a pH of 7.4. It will be appreciated that the low voltages used in accordance with the present application are preferably not greater than forty (40) volts DC or an equivalent value if other than direct current is used. More preferably, the voltages used in accordance with the present application are not more than about thirty (30) volts DC. The use of low voltages avoids the problem of production of undesirable products in the fluid which can result when higher voltages are used. In accordance with the present application, the close spacing of the electrodes facilitates the use of low voltages. In another example, to show that the embodiment of Figures 14-15 can be used to effectively carry out electrolysis in saline solutions up to about 1 % in concentration, the electrolysis reaction is carried out at saline concentrations of 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9%, respectively. The active chlorine species CI2 and ozone 03 contents were measured and are provided in the table below: As can be seen from the above table, the resulting electrolyzed saline solution includes active components which are within the parameters required for effective treatment. It will be appreciated that the features of the present application, including the close electrode spacing, the low voltages used, and the materials used to fabricate the electrodes, result in an apparatus which provides unexpectedly better results than the previously available devices and schemes. Example 4 A saline solution was made with the apparatus of Example 3 wherein the solution was electrolyzed for 3 min at 3 amps and such that the solution being electrolyzed had 9.1 g NaCI/L of purified water. The product made accordingly is called RXN-1. The RXN- 1 product was tested for superoxides and hypochlorites as described herein. Specifically, the presence of superoxides was tested with the Nanodrop 3300 and R-phycoerytherin (R-PE) as the reagent and the presence of hypochlorites was tested with the Nanodrop 3300 and aminophenyl fluorescein (APF) as the reagent.

The amount of hypochlorites present in the RXN-2 product was 80% of the amount of hypochlorites present in a sample made according to Example 1. Power Sources Readily available electricity, such as that which comes from a wall socket, is brought to a terminal strip. This terminal strip, also known as a terminal block, acts like a surge protector allowing a number of electrical connections from the strip to other devices. For example, the terminal strip can be an interface for electrical circuits. The terminal strip can be connected to a ground and/or a current transformer. A transformer can be used to measure electric currents. The terminal strip can also be connected to a potentiometer. The potentiometer measures voltage across an electrical system and can be used to aid in adjusting the voltage. For example a dial can be connected to the potentiometer so that the operator may adjust the voltage as desired. Another transformer can be connected to the potentiometer, which can then be operably connected to a rectifier. Rectifiers in general convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). One specific type of rectifier which suits the application well is a bridge rectifier. Converting the waveform into one with a constant polarity increases the voltage output. This waveform is called a full wave rectified signal. Once the waveform and voltage are configured as desired, the DC shunt can provide a means for bringing electricity to different devices such as the electrodes, monitors and other operational instruments. Figure 19 diagrams an example of a power source which can be used in the application. Electricity comes in from the wall 10 and is met by a terminal strip 1 1. Terminal strip 1 1 is in operable communication with a potentiometer 12, and a current transformer 13. Potentiometer 12 is in operable communication with the transformer 13. The transformer 13 is in operable communication with a rectifier 14. Figure 20 diagrams an example of a power source which can be used in the application. Electricity comes in from the wall 102 and is met by a terminal strip 103. Terminal strip 103 is in operable communication with a potentiometer 105, a grounding means 101 and a current transformer 104. Potentiometer 105 is in operable communication with the transformer 106. The transformer 106 is in operable communication with a rectifier 107. Rectifier 107 is in operable communication with a DC shunt 108. Determination of ROS levels against a known standard The measurement of concentrations of ROS, particularly a superoxide, inside the solutions has been done by means of a fluoro spectrometer, Nanodrop 3300, and three varieties of fluorescent dyes, R-Phycoerytherin (R-PE), Hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HPF) and Aminophenyl fluorescein (APF), that are commonly used to determine relative ROS concentrations inside active biological systems and cells. The molecules in these dyes change shape, and therefore fluoresce only when exposed to molecular components in ROS. The resulting change in fluorescence can then be detected by the fluoro spectrometer and can be related to the concentration of ROS present. ROS concentrations in electrolyzed saline solutions (ESS) solutions are verified and detected by either APF or R-PE fluorescent dyes, both of which produce entirely consistent measurements of relative concentrations of ROS in various concentrations and dilutions of ESS solutions. ROS measurements in ESS solutions have been linked using R-PE fluorescent dye, to the reaction of this dye to regulated concentrations of 2/2'-Axobis(2- methylpropionamide)dihidrochloride, a molecule that produces known amounts of ROS. This is not an absolute measurement, but it relates ROS in ESS to amounts of a known producer of ROS. These fluorescent dyes are often used in combination with a fluorescence microscope to create high-resolution images of the build-up of ROS (oxidative stress) inside individual living cells. These dyes have been shown to specifically be sensitive to concentrations of ROS regardless of complex surrounding chemical environments. Although APF and R-PE dyes are capable of measuring relative ROS concentrations in ESS solutions, no known absolute standard concentration for stabilized ROS in pure saline solutions exists. Furthermore, discrepancies in the decay time of these fluorescent dyes make measuring standardized amounts of ROS in other solutions incompatible with measuring those found in ESS. This may be due, in part, to the molecular complexes in ESS solutions that keep the ROS concentration stable, effectively shielding the free radicals from readily reacting with the dyes. The standard for ROS concentration in ESS solutions is therefore measured relative to the ROS concentration in a standardized solution that has been used in all of the antimicrobial and toxicity studies to date, both published and unpublished. Methods to measure absolute ROS concentrations in ESS solutions are actively being pursued. The regulated amounts of ROS, thus measured, inside a variety of the ESS solutions produced by various embodiments of this application have been shown to be stable, consistent and predictable, sufficient for therapeutic applications. The development of a phycobiliprotein fluorescence quenching assay for the routine determination of ROS content in ASEA has been successful and is used routinely to monitor production quality for ROS levels. The assay has the following characteristics: ease of use, sensitivity, and quantitation. The assay is linear over a 2 Iog10 range of ROS concentrations. For a compositions comprising RXNs, the starting saline was used as a negative control, AAPH (2,2'-Azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride which is a standard ROS generating compound) served as a positive control and allowed the generation of a standard curve, and the compositions comprising RXNs or other samples comprised the unknowns. For the purposes of this work, we determined the oxygen radical content of our health benefiting product. In the assay described below, R-Phycoerythrin [an algal protein] is exposed to varying levels of a standard ROS generating compound [AAPH] wherein the level of fluorescence quenching is logarithmically related to ROS content. This provides a standard curve from which to estimate the ROS content of unknown samples. The levels of ROS in the unknown samples are expressed as mM equivalents of AAPH. Figure 24 shows the concentration of AAPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PHYCOERYTHRIN and R-PHYCOERYTHRIN: were purchased from Sigma Chemical Corporation, St. Louis, MO. AAPH : 2,2'-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride was purchased from Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond , VA. This compound generates ROS upon contact with water. FLUORESCENCE READER: an 8 or 16 place fluorescence reader manufactured by Pacific Technologies, Redmond, WA was used to detect the fluorescence signal from the phycoerythrins. Temperature was controlled at 37C during a 12-20 hr. experimental run. The samples were interrogated every 0.5 to 2 min where each sample interrogation was comprised of 1024 lamp flashes from a LED whose emission spectra was appropriate from the excitation spectra of R-Phycoerythrin. Proper cut-off filters were employed to detect the fluorescence emissions of the phycoerythrins. DATA ANALYSES: All data is captured in real time. The data contained in the worksheet can be manipulated to determine the relative change of fluorescence over the time course of the experiment and subsequently, SigmaPlot Pro v. 7 software [SPSS Software, Chicago, IL] is used to determine the area under the curve. Area under the curve [AUC] analysis is appropriate since Cao, Cao et al. Comparison of different analytical methods for assessing total antioxidant capacity of human serum. Clinical Chemistry June 1998 vol. 44 no. 6 1309-1315 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, and colleagues have demonstrated that in this method both the inhibition time and degree of inhibition of fluorescence by free radicals are considered. The area under the curve [AUC] are plotted against the log 10 mM AAPH concentration to provide a standard curve from which to estimate the levels of ROS in unknown samples. DETAILED METHODS: Step a. 300 [it of phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mM is added to /2" glass vials. Step b. 15 ug of R-Phycoerythrin in 15 pL of phosphate buffer is added to the materials in Step a. The vials are capped and placed into the wells of the fluorescence reader for 15 min prior to the addition of a saline control, ASEA or AAPH solutions. During this period, fluorescence values are collected from which to calculate a 100% value. This value is then used in subsequent calculations to determine a relative fluorescence signal value for the standard curves. 1 mg of AAPH is added to 1 ml of phosphate buffer and 10-fold dilutions are made to provide at least a 3 log 10 range of AAPH concentrations. Similarly, ASEA solutions are diluted and added to appropriate vials in Step b. 100 [it of the materials in Step a are added to the appropriate vials in Step b. The vials are mixed and replaced into the reader for up to an additional 12 to 20 hrs of evaluation. RESULTS: As shown in Figure 24, as the concentration of AAPH decreased from 1.00 mM to 0.050 mM, there was as concomitant increase in the normalized AUC. Buffer control [not shown] revealed that over time there is a spontaneous loss of fluorescence signal, although this loss represents only ~ 8% of the original signal. The data represented in Figure 25 shows intra-assay variability of two concentrations of AAPH. Using SigmaStat v 2.01 software, the following mean, Std Deviation and Relative Std Deviation were calculated and are presented in Table 1 . The data shows that the variation for each concentration the variation among replicates ranged from ~ 0.1 % to 4% variation [Rel. Std. Dev.]. These data suggest that fluorescence quenching assay is capable of producing small variations among triplicate or quadruplicate samples over a 10-fold range of AAPH concentrations. Table 1. Intraassay Variability Table 2 shows the results of the analyses of ASEA solutions prepared by MDI and filtered through 0.2 u Supor membrane to ensure sterility prior to clinical application. It is clear that the ASEA from different production lots are similar in their ROS content. Statistical analysis supported this observation [p = 0.272]. The most important point is the observation that filtration through a 0.2 u Supor membrane does not decrease the ROS content of ASEA. Table 2. ROS Content of ASEA Filtered and Unfiltered Through 0.2 Supor Membrane Table 2 The levels of variance [Rel. Std. Dev.] reported by us is similar to that reported by Cao and colleagues. In Table 3, data from a typical analysis is illustrated. Saline [negative control] always contained less than 0.1 mM AAPH equivalents of ROS whereas ASEA always contained > 1.0 mM ROS. Table 3. ROS Content of ASEA and Saline ASEA or Saline Mean AUC ROS Content Samples mM AAPH equivalents ASEA 479 3.3 ASEA 543 2.2 ASEA 441 4.5 ASEA 523 2.98 ASEA 516 3.2 Saline 974 0.095 Saline 956 0.075 The above shows a known concentration of a standard, AAPH, as 653 and 804 when tested at 3.69 mM and 0.369 mM respectively. Compositions comprising RXNs showed a AUC of between 441-543. The measurement of concentrations of ROS inside the solutions can be done by means of a fluorospectrometer, Nanodrop 3300, and three varieties of fluorescent dyes, R-Phycoerytherin (R-PE), Hydroxyphenyl fluorescein (HPF) and Aminophenyl fluorescein (APF), all of which are commonly used to determine relative ROS concentrations inside active biological systems and cells. The molecules in these dyes change shape, and therefore fluoresce only when exposed to molecular components in ROS. The resulting change in fluorescence can then be detected by the fluorospectrometer and can be related to the concentration of ROS present. ROS concentrations in compositions comprising RXNs can be verified and detected by either APF or R-PE fluorescent dyes, both of which produce entirely consistent measurements of relative concentrations of ROS in various concentrations and dilutions of RXNs. The ROS measurements in a compositions comprising RXNs have been linked, using R-PE fluorescent dye, to the reaction of this dye to regulated concentrations of 2/2'-Axobis(2-methylpropionamide) dihidrochloride, a molecule that produces known amounts of ROS. Superoxide testing Superoxides were tested with the NanoDrop 3300 and R-PE as the reagent for the three samples. The intensity of the fluorescence indicates the amount of ROS in the sample. This dye, R-PE, is toxic, expensive, must be kept refrigerated, degrades in strong blue light, such as a fluorescent bulb, and is time sensitive. The following steps were taken: The ND-3300 software was called up, the "Other Fluorophores" button was clicked and the "R-PE 50uM Activated" option was selected. The ND-3300 was blanked: 2μΙ_ (1 drop) of deionized water was placed using a pipette on the measurement pedestal and the arm was carefully closed. The "Blank" button was clicked and the ND-3300 took a "blank" measurement, thereby calibrating the ND-3300. The samples were prepared by pipetting 10 ml deionized water into each one of the large (15 ml) test tubes required for the test. One test tube will be required for each sample to be tested. The test tubes were labeled by cutting out squares of sticky-back label stock, large enough to fit over the mouth of the test tubes, and by writing the number "1 ", "2" and "3" on the label. The labels were placed covering the mouth of the test tubes to both identify them and to keep the liquids from evaporating. 10 μΙ_ of the R-PE fluorescent dye was apportioned into each of the test tubes by following these steps: turning off the lights, taking the previously prepared R-PE dye test tube out of the refrigerator [this test tube was previously prepared by putting 2 μΙ_ of the concentrate from the commercial R-PE vial inside 5 ml deionized water (a phosphate buffer is not needed)] . The prepared test tube was placed in the rack with the others. This dye is toxic and is sensitive to light so these steps should be done quickly, with lab coat, gloves and goggles. With a clean pipette, 10 μΙ_ of the prepared R-PE dye was add into each of the test tubes. The R-PE was placed back in the test tube back in the refrigerator. The test tubes were mixed well using a mixing pipette which was place into each of the test tubes, 2-3 ml were drawn out and then quickly pushed back in, allowing some bubbles to escape to better agitate the contents of the test tubes. This was repeated three to four times for each tube. At this point, it is necessary to have separate mixing pipette heads for each tube. The test tubes were allowed to sit for least 30 min. after mixing. The initial pre-sample measurements were taken on all of the test tubes: The ND- 3300 was blanked using the procedures outlined above. A folded Kimwipe was used to blot the last sample droplet off the lower and upper pedestals before loading a new drop to be analyzed. A descriptive name for the sample was typed into the Sample ID field in the software. 2 μΙ_ of test tube #1 was loaded onto the pedestal, the arm was carefully closed and the "measure" button pressed. Three measurements were taken of the sample in test tube #1 . This procedure was repeated for the next two samples. Specifically, the Sample ID field was changed to reflect the descriptive name of the sample in the second test tube. And then three (3) measurements were taken from the second test tube also. This step was done until all test tubes were analyzed. When R- PE was activated, the RFU readings shown were between the 100 and 2000. Compositions comprising RXNs was added to the test tubes: This procedure was carefully timed. The R-PE dye is only accurate for less than 30 minutes after activation and therefore all measurements must be acquired after the same amount of exposure time. 10 μΙ_ of a compositions comprising RXNs sample #1 was added to test tube #1 and immediately thereafter a timer was set for three (3) minutes. Then the test tube #1was mixed with a pipette. This step was repeated for all three samples. At 6 hrs post addition of the first a compositions comprising RXNs sample to a test tube, measurements were taken from every test tube in the following manner. The ND- 3300 was blanked, the pedestals were blotted and the "Sample ID" for test tube #1 was typed in. After three (3) minutes, using a sampling pipette, a 2 μΙ_ drop was taken from test tube #1 and place it on the pedestal and the measure button was pressed. This process was repeated until all of the test tubes were measured. The data was cleaned up by pressing the "Show Report" button so that all of the data that has been taken so far was displayed. The data was then saved and analyzed. Hypochlorite testing Hypochlorites were tested with the NanoDrop 3300 Fluorospectrometer and APF as the reagent. The ND-3300 software was called up, the "Other Fluorophores" button was clicked and the "APF 50uM Activated" option was selected. The ND-3300 was blanked: 2μΙ_ (1 drop) of deionized water was placed using a pipette on the measurement pedestal and the arm was carefully closed. The "Blank" button was clicked and the ND-3300 took a "blank" measurement, thereby calibrating the ND-3300. The samples were prepared by pipetting 10 ml deionized water into each one of the large (15 ml) test tubes required for the test. One test tube will be required for each sample to be tested. The test tubes were labeled by cutting out squares of sticky-back label stock, large enough to fit over the mouth of the test tubes, and by writing the number "1 ", "2" and "3" on the label. The labels were placed covering the mouth of the test tubes to both identify them and to keep the liquids from evaporating. 10 μΙ_ of the APF fluorescent dye was apportioned into each of the test tubes by following these steps: turning off the lights, taking the previously prepared APF dye test tube out of the refrigerator [this test tube was previously prepared by putting 2 μΙ_ of the concentrate from the commercial APF vial inside 5 ml deionized water (a phosphate buffer is not needed)] . The prepared test tube was placed in the rack with the others. This dye is toxic and is sensitive to light so these steps should be done quickly, with lab coat, gloves and goggles. With a clean pipette, 10 μΙ_ of the prepared APF dye was add into each of the test tubes. The APF was placed back in the test tube back in the refrigerator. The test tubes were mixed well using a mixing pipette which was place into each of the test tubes, 2-3 ml were drawn out and then quickly pushed back in, allowing some bubbles to escape to better agitate the contents of the test tubes. This was repeated three to four times for each tube. At this point, it is necessary to have separate mixing pipette heads for each tube. The test tubes were allowed to sit for least 30 min. after mixing.

Three measurements were taken of the sample in test tube #1 . This procedure was repeated for the next two samples. Specifically, the Sample ID field was changed to reflect the descriptive name of the sample in the second test tube. And then three (3) measurements were taken from the second test tube also. This step was done until all test tubes were analyzed. When APF was activated, the RFU readings shown were between the 100 and 2000. Compositions comprising RXNs was added to the test tubes: This procedure was carefully timed. The APF dye is only accurate for less than 30 minutes after activation and therefore all measurements must be acquired after the same amount of exposure time. 10 μΙ_ of a compositions comprising RXNs sample #1 was added to test tube #1 and immediately thereafter a timer was set for three (3) minutes. Then the test tube #1was mixed with a pipette. This step was repeated for all three samples. At 30 min. post addition of the first a compositions comprising RXNs sample to a test tube, measurements were taken from every test tube in the following manner. The ND-3300 was blanked, the pedestals were blotted and the "Sample ID" for test tube #1 was typed in. After three (3) minutes, using a sampling pipette, a 2 μΙ_ drop was taken from test tube #1 and place it on the pedestal and the measure button was pressed. This process was repeated until all of the test tubes were measured. Packaging The packaging process includes any type of packaging that does not contribute to the decay of the superoxides, hydroxyl radicals and OOH* (for example, containers should not contain metal oxides or ions). Pouches and bottles are preferred for ease of portability and acceptability in the market. However, any suitable packaging is applicable. Containers/packaging can be made of for example glass, polyethylene, polypropylene and the like. Specific examples include Bapolene HD2035, which is a high density polyethylene copolymer and Jade brand CZ-302 polyester. Table 4 shows the relative percentage of superoxides remaining after a 12 month period when the composition is packaged in a polyethylene bottle. Example 6 The rate of decay for superoxides, from a sample made according to Example 1 , was tested over a 12 month period. That is, superoxides present in a sample made when a total of 1 ,000 gallons of salinated water is electrolyzed with a total of 56 amps running through the electrodes and further wherein the electrolyzing occurred at 4.5-5.8°C, according to Example 1 , were tested for their relative amounts over a period of 12 months relative to a standard RFU control. Table 4: 1 Year Studies - shows a 3%/month decay rate over a 12 month period Table 4 provides data for the RFU control, Sample 1 which is a reference sample and Samples 2-6 which were taken at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. Table 4A shows the results as a percentage of remaining superoxides at 0, 1 , 3, 6 and 12 months. This Table 4 is graphically represented in Figure 22. Table 4A Month % Potency 0 100 1 101 3 85 Example 7 Table 5 shows the relative percentage of superoxides remaining after a 13 month period when the composition is packaged in a polyethylene bottle and polyethylene pouch. In this Example, the composition tested was made according to the process of Example 6. Table 5: 13 Month Pouch v. Bottle The above graph shows a 4.4% decay rate of the superoxide radical for the pouch and a 3% decay rate for the bottle over a 13 month period. Sample 555 is a reference sample, Sample 555-1 is a baseline sample, Sample 525b is a sample taken from a bottle after 1 month, Sample 524p is a sample taken from a pouch after 1 month, Sample 480 is a Sample taken from a bottle after 3 months, Sample 479p is a sample taken from a pouch after 3 months, Sample 408p is a sample taken from a pouch after 8 months, Sample 374p is a sample taken from a pouch after 1 1 months, Sample 314 is a sample taken from a bottle after 13 months and Sample 313p is a sample taken from a pouch after 13 months. Table 5A is a chart showing the percentage of remaining superoxides at 0, 1 , 3, 8, 1 1 and 13 months in a bottle and a pouch type container. This Table 5 is graphically represented in Figure 23. Table 5A Example 8 Borosilicate glass, such as those sold under the trade names of Kimax, Pyrex, Endural, Schott, or Refmex for example, are useful for packaging of compositions comprising RXNs. The presence of superoxides in compositions comprising RXNs samples were tested after being stored in borosilicate glass bottles. The samples were made according to the process described in Example 6. Sample 397 had been stored for 24 months and Sample 512 had been stored for 20 months. Reference batch 1256 was made the same day as the test was run on all three samples. The Results are shown in Table 6. Table 6 Glass Bottle ASEA Stability Sample RFU average RFU Control - % Potency as average + compared to control loss reference sample 397 780.5 806.8 1 193.2 93.1 169 819.5 820.4 512 676.7 682.4666667 1317.533333 102.8198 682.6 688.1 Reference sample 1256 754.8 718.6 1281 .4 100 707.2 693.8 Control 1850 Control after 6 hours 1700 It can be seen from the Tables that the relative concentrations of superoxides do not appreciably degrade while in the borosilicate bottles. Sample 397 had a decayed about 5% and sample 512 had 0% decay. Therefore, the yearly decay of product is no more than about 2.5% decay per year. This gives an estimated half-life of the superoxides at about 24 years. The stability of any component in the composition can be measured by the amount of the particular composition which remains detectable after a certain amount of time. For example, if the superoxides measured had a decay rate of about 7% over a two year period, this would mean that the stability over the 2 year period was about 93%. In other words, after a two year period, about 93% of the original amount of superoxides, were still present and measured in the composition. Example 9 A series of assays were carried out to determine the effectiveness of the disclosed compositions against various fungi. Two compositions were prepared, RXN-1 and RXN- 2, as described above. RXN-1 comprised a sodium chloride concentration of 9.1 g/L. RXN-2 comprised a sodium chloride concentration of 2.8 g/L. Both compositions were prepared as described above in Example 3 using a set of electrodes with a current of about 3 amps, to form an antifungal composition, wherein the water is at or below room temperature during 3 minutes of electrolyzing. The compositions were exposed to different type of fungi for different amounts of time and the results recorded. Aliquots of a suspension of Trichophyton mentagrophytes were exposed to RXN- 1 , also referred to as RXN-1 R.O. 9.1 ppt (Fungi), for 30, 60, 90 or 120 seconds at room temperature. Similarly, aliquots of a suspension of Trichophyton mentagrophytes were exposed to RXN-2, also referred to as RXN-2 R.O. 2.8 ppt (Fungi), for 30, 60, 90 or 120 seconds at room temperature. After exposure to RXN-1 and RXN-2, respectively, a sample of each aliquot was transferred to neutralizer solution and then assayed for surviving fungi. Appropriate culture purity, neutralizer sterility, test population control and neutralization confirmation controls were also performed. Table A shows results for culture purity and neutralizer solution sterility. Table B shows results for test population control. Table C shows results for neutralization confirmation controls.

Table F. Calculated Test Results for RXN-1 R.O. 9.1 ppt (Fungi) *Colony Forming Units per mL of test or control mixture The test results of each of the compositions were analyzed. As shown above, RXN-1 R.O. 9.1 ppt (Fungi), ready to use, demonstrated a >99.99% (>4.84 log 10) reduction of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (ATC 9533) survivors following a 30 second, 60 second, 90 second, and 120 second exposure time when tested at ambient temperature (24.3°C). As shown above, RXN-2 R.O. 2.8 ppt (Fungi), ready to use, demonstrated a 97.5% (1.59 log 10) reduction of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (ATC 9533) survivors following a 30 second exposure time, a 99.9% (3.18 log 10) reduction of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (ATC 9533) survivors following a 60 second exposure time, a >99.99% (>4.84 log 0) reduction of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (ATC 9533) survivors following a 90 second and 120 second exposure time, when tested at ambient temperature (24.3°C). Therefore, the compositions RXN-1 and RXN-2 were shown to be effective against Trichophyton mentagrophytes (ATC 9533) under the conditions tested above.
