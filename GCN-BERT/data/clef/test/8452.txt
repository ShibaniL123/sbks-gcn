CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a U.S. National Phase of International Application No. PCT/US2008/070651, filed on Jul. 21, 2008, which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/951,614, filed Jul. 24, 2007, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety herein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to biocides. The present invention relates more particularly to biocidal mixtures of oxazolidine compounds and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compounds, and methods of using them. 2. Technical Background Protecting water-based fluids (e.g., in injection and production systems) from microbial contamination is vital for the efficiency and success of any oil or natural gas production operation. Metabolic activity of microorganisms can cause microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) on metal surfaces of equipment and cause degradation of polymer additives. Biofilms formed by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can physically plug oil and gas pipelines and water purification systems, as well as reduce efficiency of pumps and heat transfer systems. Moreover, certain anaerobic bacteria, known as sulfate reducing bacteria, can reduce sulfate to produce hydrogen sulfide, which can sour oil and gas, corrode pipelines and storage tanks and cause deposits of iron sulfide. Microbial contamination can occur anywhere throughout the oil and natural gas field during oil and gas production operations. For example, although aerobic and anaerobic bacteria coexist in many environments, aerobic bacteria are more often found topside (i.e., near the surface) in injection water, produced water, and functional water-based fluids such as drilling muds, completion or workover fluids, stimulation fluids and fracturing fluids. Anaerobic bacteria, on the other hand, are most commonly found downhole (i.e., underground) in oil or gas reservoirs, near bore areas, in produced fluids, in deaeration towers, in transmission pipelines, and in the water bottoms of oil and gas storage tanks. Biological contamination is a major complication in many other industrial processes and systems. Pulp and paper water, cooling water (e.g., in cooling towers), boiler water, industrial process water, ballast water, waste water, metalworking fluids, water-based slurry, ink and tape-joint compound, water-based household products and personal care products, latex, paint, coatings, and water purification and treatment systems and components thereof are all vulnerable to contamination by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Biocides are commonly used to control the growth of microorganisms in aqueous systems. However, many are not entirely effective at controlling all types of bacterial growth and some are incompatible with other water treatment additives. The inventors have determined that there remains a need for biocidal treatment methods and formulations having increased efficiency over current systems. One aspect of the invention is a method of reducing or inhibiting increase in the concentration of microbes in a water-based fluid or in a system used with a water-based fluid, the method comprising contacting the water-based fluid or system with an oxazolidine compound and a hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound selected from the group consisting of tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts, C1-C3 alkyl- and alkenyltris(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts and tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine. Another aspect of the invention is a formulation for reducing or inhibiting increase in the concentration of microbes in a water-based fluid or in a system used with a water-based fluid, the formulation comprising an oxazolidine compound and a hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound selected from the group consisting of tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts, C1-C3 alkyl- and alkenyltris(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts and tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine. The present invention is capable of providing a number of advantages over the prior art. For example, use of both an oxazolidine compound and a hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound can unexpectedly maximize synergy between the two components in a wide range of applications. The methods and formulations of the present invention can be used at relatively low biocide loadings, reducing cost, odor, worker exposure and environmental effects. In certain embodiments of the invention, the biocidal treatment can be carried out in the absence of a quaternary ammonium salt, and therefore allows the unhindered use of anionic polymers for flocculation and purification. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the detailed description which follows and will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the description or recognized by practicing the invention as described in the written description and claims hereof, as well as in the appended drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are merely exemplary of the invention, and are intended to provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the invention as it is claimed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the invention is a method of reducing or inhibiting an increase in the concentration of microbes in a water-based fluid or in a system used with a water-based fluid. The method comprises contacting the water-based fluid or system with an oxazolidine compound and a hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound selected from the group consisting of tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts, C1-C3 alkyl- and alkenyltris(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts and tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine. As described in more detail below, the inventors have unexpectedly found that the use of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compounds and oxazolidine compounds together can provide better biocidal activity than the use of either substance alone. Water-based fluids treatable using the methods of the present invention can be found in many forms. For example, the water-based fluid can exist as a volume of water or aqueous solution. Alternatively, the water-based fluid can be a slurry or suspension, or can be the liquid fraction of a mud, pulp, or other mixed-phase system. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, the water-based fluids treatable according to the present invention may include other substances, such as polymers, demulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, scale inhibitors and/or surfactants. Depending on the application, the water-based fluids can also include other appropriate substances, such as thickeners (e.g., clays, polymers), salts, density increasing substances (e.g., barite), lubricants and viscosity modifiers. Similarly, systems used with water-based fluids take many forms, and include, for example, systems used in water purification, oil or natural gas production and transmission, paper- and pulpmaking, metalworking, heating and cooling, storage, and cleaning and rinsing processes. In one embodiment of the invention, the oxazolidine compound is a monocyclic oxazolidine, bicyclic oxazolidine, bisoxazolidine, or polyoxazolidine, each of which is optionally substituted with C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, or hydroxy(C1-C6 alkyl). In one embodiment, the oxazolidine compound is monocyclic oxazolidine such as 4,4-dimethyoxazolidine. 4,4-dimethyloxazolidine is available as a 78 wt % solution in water from The Dow Chemical Company as BIOBAN™ CS-1135. In another embodiment, the oxazolidine compound is bicyclic oxazolidine. For example, the oxazolidine compound can be a 1-aza-3,7-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane optionally substituted with C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, or hydroxy(C1-C6 alkyl), such as 7-ethylbicyclooxazolidine (5-ethyl-1-aza-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane), 5-hydroxymethoxymethyl-1-aza-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane and 5-hydroxymethyl-1-aza-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane. 7-ethyl-bicyclooxazolidine is available in 97% purity (remainder water) from The Dow Chemical Company as BIOBAN™ CS-1246, and 5-hydroxymethyl- and 5-hydroxymethoxymethyl-1-aza-3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane are available as a mixture as NUOSEPT® 95 from International Specialty Products. In another embodiment of the invention, the oxazolidine compound is a bisoxazolidine. For example, the bisoxazolidine N,N-methylenebis(5-methyl-oxazolidine) is available in 90-100% purity from Halliburton as STARCIDE®. In other embodiments of the invention, the oxazolidine compound is a polyoxazolidine. Of course, more than one oxazolidine compound can be combined for use in the present invention; in such cases, ratios and concentrations are calculated using the total weight of all oxazolidine compounds. Hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compounds are also generally available both in undissolved form or as aqueous solutions. In one embodiment of the invention, the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound is a tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salt. For example, the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound can be tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium sulfate (THPS). THPS is available from The Dow Chemical Company as AQUCAR™ THPS 75, a 75 wt % solution in water. Other tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts, such as tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride, can also be used. In other embodiments of the invention, the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound is a C1-C3 alkyl- and alkenyltris(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salt or tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine. Of course, more than one of the recited hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compounds can be combined for use in the present invention; in such cases, ratios and concentrations are calculated using the total weight of all hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compounds. In one embodiment of the invention, the weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound is in the range of about 50:1 to about 1:50. In certain embodiments of the invention, the weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound is in the range of about 5:1 to about 1:10. For example, the weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to the oxazolidine compound can be in the range of about 5:1 to about 1:1, or in the range of about 1:5 to about 1:10. All ratios discussed herein are weight/weight, unless otherwise noted. The methods of the present invention can be used in a variety of applications to treat a wide variety of water-based fluids, such as oilfield and natural gas field water and functional fluids or components of the functional fluids (e.g. drilling muds, completion and workover fluids, stimulation fluids, packing fluids, fracturing fluids, hydrotest fluids), pulp or paper water and slurry, cooling water, boiler water, industrial process water, ballast water, waste water, metalworking fluids, hydrocarbon oil and natural gas, water-based slurry, ink and tape joint compound, water-based household products and personal care products, latex, paint and coatings. As used herein, “water-based fluid” includes hydrocarbon oil and natural gas that may have an aqueous phase associated therewith. The methods of the present invention can be especially useful in treating oilfield and natural gas field water and functional fluids, oil and gas transmission and storage systems. The methods of the present invention can also be used in a variety of systems used with water-based fluids, such as those used in heating, cooling, oil and natural gas production, paper production. The methods of the present invention can also be used to control bacteria and prevent biofouling in water purification systems, such as those using reverse osmosis membranes, microfiltration membranes or ultrafiltration membranes, as well as those using sand filtration, multimedia filtration, active carbon filtration, ion exchange and electrodionization. In one embodiment of the invention, the microbes are aerobic bacteria. In certain embodiments of the invention, aerobic bacteria are treated using a weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound in the range of about 50:1 to about 1:50. These ratios can be useful in reducing and/or maintaining microbial concentrations in water-based fluids and systems in which aerobic bacteria are dominant, such as topside or surface oil field and natural gas field water, components of oil and gas field drilling muds, completion and workover water-based fluids, stimulation fluids, packing fluids, fracturing water-based fluids, hydrotest fluids, hydrocarbon oil and gas, water-based slurry, ink and tape joint compounds, water-based household products and personal care products, latex, paint, coatings, metalworking fluids and systems, ballast water, cooling water, boiler water, pulp or paper processing systems or water-based fluids associated therewith, industrial process water, and other open systems and water-based fluids therein. According to another embodiment of the invention, the microbes are anaerobic bacteria. In certain embodiments of the invention, anaerobic bacteria are treated using a weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound in the range of about 50:1 to about 1:50. These ratios can be useful in reducing and/or maintaining microbial concentrations in water-based fluids and systems in which anaerobic bacteria are dominant, such as injection water and fluids in oil and natural gas reservoirs, produced water and fluids in oil and gas production operations, oil or gas storage tanks or water-based fluids therein, deaeration towers or water-based fluids therein, transmission pipelines or water based fluids therein, pulp or paper processing systems or water-based fluids associated therewith, ballast water, wastewater treatment systems and water-based fluids therein, and closed systems and lower parts of open systems and water-based fluids therein. The skilled artisan can select final working concentrations of the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound necessary to provide the desired antimicrobial effect. For example, according to one embodiment of the invention, the combined concentration of oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound in the water-based fluid or system is in the range of about 5 ppm to about 3500 ppm. The combined concentration of oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound in the water-based fluid or system can be in the range of about 10 ppm to about 500 ppm. In certain embodiments of the invention, the combined concentration of oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound in the water-based fluid or system is in the range of about 50 ppm to about 200 ppm, or in the range of about 10 ppm to about 100 ppm. In other embodiments of the invention, the combined concentration of oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound in the water-based fluid or system can be in the range of about 1 ppm to about 20000 ppm. According to one embodiment of the invention, during the contacting step the water-based fluid or system is substantially free of quaternary ammonium compounds. For example, the water-based fluid or system can have less than 100 ppm, less than 25 ppm, less than 5 ppm, or even less than 1 ppm. The inventors have found ratios of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound and oxazolidine compound that provide biocidal efficiency without the use of quaternary ammonium compounds. In this embodiment of the invention, therefore, the water-based fluid can contain at least one polymer (anionic, cationic or nonionic), demulsifier, corrosion inhibitor, scale inhibitor and/or surfactant without suffering a reduction in efficacy due to the presence of (e.g., through precipitation by) quaternary ammonium species. In certain embodiments of the invention, during the contacting step the water-based fluid or system is substantially free of adducts between formaldehyde and C2-C6 aliphatic glycol or C2-C6 aliphatic glycol mono C1-C4 alkyl ether. For example, the water based fluid can have a concentration of adducts between formaldehyde and C2-C6 aliphatic glycol or C2-C6 aliphatic glycol mono C1-C4 alkyl ether of less than about 100 ppm, less than 25 ppm, less than 5 ppm, or even less than 1 ppm. In certain embodiments of the invention, the method includes contacting the water-based fluid or system with at least one additional biocide. The skilled artisan will choose the identity and concentration of the additional biocide based on the particular application envisioned. Suitable additional biocides include, for example, 2,2-dibromo-2-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA), 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol (bronopol), 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MIT), tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-azonia-adamantane chloride, 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, 2,6-dimethyl-m-dioxan-4-ol acetate, and o-phthalaldehyde. In some embodiments of the invention, the water-based fluid or system is contacted with the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound at more than one ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the water-based fluid is contacted at a first ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound in the range of about 50:1 to about 1:50; and also contacted at a second ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound in the range of about 50:1 to about 1:50, in which the first ratio is different than the second ratio. The contacting at the first ratio can be performed before the contacting at the second ratio. Alternatively, the contacting at the second ratio can be performed before the contacting at the first ratio. The methods according to these embodiments of the invention can be used to reduce or prevent microbial contamination in a water-based fluid or system over time. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, as a water-based fluid moves through a system or process, or as the process taking place in a system evolves, it can be subject to contamination by different types of microbes. For example, at a position or time where the water-based fluid or system is at risk of contamination by aerobic microbes, it can be contacted at a first ratio in the range of about 50:1 to about 1:50. Similarly, at a position or time in a system or process where the water-based fluid is at risk of contamination by anaerobic microbes, it can be contacted at a second ratio in the range of about 50:1 to about 1:50. For example, water or a functional fluid is often injected downhole into an oil or gas well to enhance the productivity of the oil or gas well. The water or functional fluid can initially be contacted at a first ratio in order to achieve better control of aerobic microbes. At a later point, for example when the fresh water enters a deaeration tower and/or immediately before the water or functional fluid is injected downhole, it can be contacted at a second ratio to obtain and maintain better control of anaerobic microbes in deaeration towers and/or downhole areas. In souring wells, produced fluids can first be treated at one ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound in order to reduce anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogen sulfide. After oil/gas/water separation, the produced water can be treated with a another ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound before release or reinjection in order to better control aerobic microbes. The contacting can be performed in many different ways, depending on factors such as the type of water-based fluid or system being treated and its location in an oil or gas production or other industrial system or process. For example, the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound can be added to the water-based fluid or system at substantially the same time. For example, the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound can be provided as a mixture in the desired ratio, which is added to the water-based fluid or system. Alternatively, the oxazolidine compound can be added to the water-based fluid or system at substantially the same time by adding one after the other with little delay (i.e., 3 minutes or less) between additions. In other embodiments of the invention, the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound are added to the water-based fluid or system at different times (i.e., with a delay of more than 3 minutes). In these embodiments of the invention, the oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound components are added to yield after addition the desired final concentration and ratio in the water-based fluid or system. The oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound may be added in a single dose (or “slug”) to a pipeline, reservoir or other part of a system, or may be added together in multiple slugs. The oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound may alternatively be continuously added to the water-based fluid or system in order to maintain a desired concentration and ratio of components. When the method is used with a system, system components can be contacted with the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound in an assembled and/or operational state. System components can also be contacted with the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound in a separate bath or fluid circulation system. For example, in methods of the invention used to treat a water purification system, the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound can be pumped through the entire system (e.g., by adding them to the feed water while the system is on-line). A single system component (e.g., a membrane) can also be isolated or removed and separately treated with the oxazolidine compound and the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound off-line in a feed tanker. Another aspect of the invention is a formulation for reducing or inhibiting increase in the concentration of microbes in a water-based fluid or in a system used with a water-based fluid. The formulation includes an oxazolidine compound and a hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound selected from the group consisting of tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts, C1-C3 alkyl- and alkenyltris(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts and tris(hydroxymethyl)phosphine. The weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound is in the range of about 50:1 to about 1:50. For example, as described above with respect to the methods of the present invention, the weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound to oxazolidine compound can be in the range of about 10:1 to about 1:20; or in the range of about 1:1 to about 1:5. When the oxazolidine compound is 4,4-dimethyloxazolidine, the weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound can be, for example, in the range of about 1:1 to about 1:5. When the oxazolidine compound is 7-ethylbicyclooxazolidine, the weight ratio of hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound can be, for example, in the range of about 2:1 to about 1:15. The formulation can have a wide variety of overall concentrations of oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound. In certain embodiments of the invention, the total concentration of oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound in the formulation is in the range of about 0.1 wt % to about 99 wt %. For example, the total concentration of oxazolidine compound and hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound in the formulation can be in the range of about 0.1 wt % to about 98 wt %, or in the range of about 15 wt % to about 90 wt %. During dosing of the aqueous system being treated, the user can dilute concentrated formulations to more appropriate end-use concentrations for a particular application (e.g., in the range of about 1 to about 3500 ppm; 5 ppm to about 1500 ppm; in the range of about 10 ppm to about 500 ppm; in the range of about 50 ppm to about 200 ppm; or in the range of about 10 ppm to about 100 ppm). In certain embodiments of the invention, the formulation also includes water. For example, the water concentration of the formulation can be in the range of about 1 wt % to about 99 wt %; in the range of about 5 wt % to about 95 wt %; or in the range of about 50 wt % to about 85 wt %. Of course, other solvents, such as lower alcohols, glycols, glycol ethers and esters and dimethylformamide, can be used in the formulations of the present invention in addition to or in place of water. The formulations of the present invention can be prepared using methods standard in the formulation arts. For example, it will often be convenient to simply blend commercially-available concentrated aqueous solutions (such as BIOBAN™ CS-1135 or BIOBAN™ CS-1246 solutions for the oxazolidine compound, and AQUCAR™ THPS 75 for the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound) in proportions appropriate to yield the desired ratios. Other additives can be added as desired, and water (and/or other solvents) can be added to further dilute the formulation to a desired total concentration. In one embodiment of the invention, the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound is a tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salt. For example, the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound can be tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium sulfate. Of course, other tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium salts, such as tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride, can also be used. In certain embodiments of the invention, the formulation includes at least one additional biocide. The skilled artisan can select the identity and concentration of the additional biocide based on the particular application envisioned. Suitable additional biocides include, for example, 2,2-dibromo-2-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA), 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol (bronopol), 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MIT), tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-azonia-adamantane chloride, 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, 2,6-dimethyl-m-dioxan-4-ol acetate, and o-phthalaldehyde. In certain embodiments of the invention, the formulation is free or substantially free of quaternary ammonium compounds. For example, the formulation can have less than 10 wt %, less than 1 wt %, or even less than 0.25 wt % quaternary ammonium compounds. As described above, quaternary ammonium compounds can be disfavored when additives such as anionic polymers, demulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors and/or surfactants are to be used. Accordingly, in this embodiment of the invention, the formulation can include at least one charged or uncharged polymer, demulsifier, corrosion inhibitor, scale inhibitor and/or surfactant. Of course, in other embodiments of the invention, the formulation can include a quaternary ammonium compound. In certain embodiments of the invention, the formulation is free or substantially free of adducts between formaldehyde and C2-C6 aliphatic glycol or C2-C6 aliphatic glycol (mono C1-C4 alkyl ether). For example, the formulation can have less than 10 wt %, less than 1 wt %, or even less than 0.25 wt % adducts between formaldehyde and C2-C6 aliphatic glycol or C2-C6 aliphatic glycol (mono C1-C4 alkyl ether). The formulations of the present invention can include other substances, depending on the ultimate application. However, in one embodiment of the invention the formulations consist essentially of the oxazolidine compound, the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound, and water. Other aspects of the invention include embodiments that combine not inconsistent aspects from one or more of the embodiments described above. For example, one embodiment described above uses THPS as the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound, and another embodiment described above the system being treated is free of quaternary ammonium compounds. Accordingly, in yet another embodiment of the invention, the hydroxymethyl-substituted phosphorus compound is THPS and the system being treated is free of quaternary ammonium compounds. The methods and formulations of the present invention can be adapted for use in many applications. For example, the methods and formulations of the present invention can be used in many phases of oil or natural gas production, transmission, and storage, both topside and downhole, such as in deaeration towers, storage tanks, injection water, production water, pigging operations, drilling muds, completion or workover fluids, stimulation fluids, packing fluids, fracturing fluids and hydrotest fluids. The methods and formulations can be used in water treatment and purification processes and systems, for example to treat membranes and other system components that are susceptible to fouling. The methods and formulations can also be used in paper and pulp production, ballast water disinfection and in other industrial processes. The methods and formulations can help prevent microbial contamination of water-based fluids and systems used in cooling and heating processes. The methods and formulations can also be used to prevent microbial contamination of water-based slurry, ink and tape-joint compound, water-based household products and personal care products, latex, paint and coatings. Of course, the methods and formulations of the present invention can also be used in other processes and apparati not mentioned specifically herein.
