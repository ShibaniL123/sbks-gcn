This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/980,114, filed Apr. 16, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. 1. FIELD Provided herein are solid forms comprising 7-(6-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1-((trans)-4-methoxycyclohexyl)-3,4-dihydropyrazino[2,3-b]pyrazin-2(1H)-one and a coformer. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising such solid forms (e.g., cocrystals) and methods of use for treating, preventing, and managing various disorders are also provided herein. 2. BACKGROUND The identification and selection of a solid form of a pharmaceutical compound is complex, given that a change in solid form may affect a variety of physical and chemical properties, which may provide benefits or drawbacks in processing, formulation, stability and bioavailability, among other important pharmaceutical characteristics. Potential pharmaceutical solids include crystalline solids and amorphous solids. Amorphous solids are characterized by a lack of long-range structural order, whereas crystalline solids are characterized by structural periodicity. The desired class of pharmaceutical solid depends upon the specific application; amorphous solids are sometimes selected on the basis of, e.g., an enhanced dissolution profile, while crystalline solids may be desirable for properties such as, e.g., physical or chemical stability (see e.g., S. R. Vippagunta et al., Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev., (2001) 48:3-26; L. Yu, Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev., (2001) 48:27-42). Whether crystalline or amorphous, potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound include single-component and multiple-component solids. Single-component solids consist essentially of the pharmaceutical compound in the absence of other compounds. Variety among single-component crystalline materials may potentially arise from the phenomenon of polymorphism, wherein multiple three-dimensional arrangements exist for a particular pharmaceutical compound (see e.g., S. R. Byrn et al., Solid State Chemistry of Drugs, (1999) SSCI, West Lafayette). The importance of discovering polymorphs was underscored by the case of Ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor that was formulated as soft gelatin capsules. About two years after the product was launched, the unanticipated precipitation of a new, less soluble polymorph in the formulation necessitated the withdrawal of the product from the market until a more consistent formulation could be developed (see S. R. Chemburkar et al., Org. Process Res. Dev., (2000) 4:413-417). Additional diversity among the potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound may arise from the possibility of multiple-component solids. Crystalline solids comprising two or more ionic species are termed salts (see e.g., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth, Eds., (2002), Wiley, Weinheim). Additional types of multiple-component solids that may potentially offer other property improvements for a pharmaceutical compound or salt thereof include, e.g., hydrates, solvates, cocrystals and clathrates, among others (see e.g., S. R. Byrn et al., Solid State Chemistry of Drugs, (1999) SSCI, West Lafayette). Moreover, multiple-component crystal forms may potentially be susceptible to polymorphism, wherein a given multiple-component composition may exist in more than one three-dimensional crystalline arrangement. The discovery of solid forms is of great importance in the development of a safe, effective, stable and marketable pharmaceutical compound. Notably, it is not possible to predict a priori if crystalline forms of a compound even exist, let alone how to successfully prepare them (see e.g., Braga and Grepioni, 2005, “Making crystals from crystals: a green route to crystal engineering and polymorphism,” Chem. Commun.:3635-3645 (with respect to crystal engineering, if instructions are not very precise and/or if other external factors affect the process, the result can be unpredictable); Jones et al., 2006, Pharmaceutical Cocrystals: An Emerging Approach to Physical Property Enhancement,” MRS Bulletin 31:875-879 (At present it is not generally possible to computationally predict the number of observable polymorphs of even the simplest molecules); Price, 2004, “The computational prediction of pharmaceutical crystal structures and polymorphism,” Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 56:301-319 (“Price”); and Bernstein, 2004, “Crystal Structure Prediction and Polymorphism,” ACA Transactions 39:14-23 (a great deal still needs to be learned and done before one can state with any degree of confidence the ability to predict a crystal structure, much less polymorphic forms)). Cocrystals are crystalline molecular complexes of two or more non-volatile compounds bound together in a crystal lattice by non-ionic interactions. Pharmaceutical cocrystals are cocrystals of a therapeutic compound, e.g., an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and one or more non-volatile compound(s) (referred to herein as coformer). A coformer in a pharmaceutical cocrystal is typically selected from non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable molecules, such as, for example, food additives, preservatives, pharmaceutical excipients, or other APIs. In recent years, pharmaceutical cocrystals have emerged as a possible alternative approach to enhance physicochemical properties of drug products. The variety of possible solid forms creates potential diversity in physical and chemical properties for a given pharmaceutical compound. The compound chemically named 7-(6-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1-((trans)-4-methoxycyclohexyl)-3,4-dihydropyrazino[2,3-b]pyrazin-2(1H)-one and tautomers thereof (collectively referred to herein as “Compound 1”) are disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Unless otherwise specified, the term “cocrystal” as used herein, refers to a crystalline material comprised of Compound 1, including tautomers thereof, and one or more non-volative compounds bound together in a crystal lattice by non-covalent interactions. Unless otherwise specified, the term “amorphous” or “amorphous form” means that the substance, component, or product in question is not substantially crystalline as determined by X-ray diffraction. In particular, the term “amorphous form” describes a disordered solid form, i.e., a solid form lacking long range crystalline order. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may be substantially free of other amorphous forms and/or crystal forms. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may contain less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less than about 3%, less than about 4%, less than about 5%, less than about 10%, less than about 15%, less than about 20%, less than about 25%, less than about 30%, less than about 35%, less than about 40%, less than about 45%, or less than about 50% by weight of one or more other amorphous forms and/or crystal forms on a weight basis. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may be physically and/or chemically pure. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance be about 99%, about 98%, about 97%, about 96%, about 95%, about 94%, about 93%, about 92%, about 91%, or about 90% physically and/or chemically pure. Unless otherwise specified, the terms “polymorph,” “polymorphic form,” “polymorphs,” “polymorphic forms,” and related terms herein refer to two or more crystal forms that consist essentially of the same molecule, molecules or ions. Different polymorphs may have different physical properties, such as, for example, melting temperatures, heats of fusion, solubilities, dissolution rates, and/or vibrational spectra as a result of a different arrangement or conformation of the molecules or ions in the crystal lattice. The differences in physical properties exhibited by polymorphs may affect pharmaceutical parameters, such as storage stability, compressibility and density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), and dissolution rate (an important factor in bioavailability). Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g., differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph) or mechanical changes (e.g., tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored polymorph converts to thermodynamically a more stable polymorph) or both (e.g., tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). As a result of solubility/dissolution differences, in the extreme case, some polymorphic transitions may result in lack of potency or, at the other extreme, toxicity. In addition, the physical properties of the crystal may be important in processing; for example, one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be difficult to filter and wash free of impurities (e.g., particle shape and size distribution might be different between polymorphs). The term “subject” refers to an animal, including, but not limited to, a primate (e.g., human), cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, dog, cat, rabbit, rat, or mouse. The terms “subject” and “patient” are used herein interchangeably in reference, for example, to a mammalian subject, such as a human subject, in one embodiment, a human. In one embodiment, the subject has or is susceptible to having a disease, disorder, or condition provided herein. The term “treat,” “treating,” or “treatment” means an alleviation, in whole or in part, of a disease, disorder, or condition provided herein, or one or more symptoms associated with the disease, disorder, or condition, or slowing, or halting of further progression or worsening of the disease, disorder, or condition, or one or more symptoms associated with the disease, disorder, or condition. The term “prevent,” “preventing,” or “prevention” means prevention of the onset, recurrence, or spread of a disease, disorder, or condition provided herein, or one or more symptoms associated with the disease, disorder, or condition, in a subject at risk for developing the disease, disorder, or condition. The term “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to, in one embodiment, an amount of Compound 1 capable of alleviating, in whole or in part, one or more symptoms associated with a disease, disorder, or condition provided herein, or slowing or halting further progression or worsening of one or more of the symptoms of the disease, disorder, or condition; in another embodiment, an amount capable of preventing or providing prophylaxis for the disease, disorder, or condition in a subject at risk for developing the disease, disorder, or condition, such as cancer, inflammatory conditions, immunological conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, obesity, neurological disorders, age-related diseases, and/or cardiovascular conditions, and/or diseases, disorders, and conditions treatable or preventable by inhibition of a kinase pathway, for example, the mTOR/PI3K/Akt pathway. In one embodiment, an effective amount of a compound is an amount that inhibits a kinase in a cell, such as, for example, in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment the kinase is TOR kinase. In certain embodiments, the effective amount of a compound inhibits the kinase in a cell by about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, or about 99%, compared to the activity of the kinase in an untreated cell. In one embodiment, “effective amount” refers to the amount of Compound 1 capable of alleviating, in whole or in part, symptoms associated with a solid tumor (for example, a neuroendocrine tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, salivary cancer, pancreatic cancer, adenocystic cancer, adrenal cancer, esophageal cancer, renal cancer, leiomyosarcoma, or paraganglioma, including advanced solid tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma, or slowing or halting further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or treating or preventing a solid tumor (for example, a neuroendocrine tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, salivary cancer, pancreatic cancer, adenocystic cancer, adrenal cancer, esophageal cancer, renal cancer, leiomyosarcoma, or paraganglioma), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma in a subject having or at risk for having a solid tumor, non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, it is to be expected that the effective amount of a compound disclosed herein may vary depending on the indication being treated, e.g., the effective amount of the compound would likely be different for treating patients suffering from, or at risk for, inflammatory conditions relative to the effective amount of the compound for treating patients suffering from, or at risk of, a different disorder, e.g., a disorder provided herein. The term “cancer” refers to any of various malignant neoplasms characterized by the proliferation of cells that can invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to new body sites. Both benign and malignant tumors are classified according to the type of tissue in which they are found. For example, fibromas are neoplasms of fibrous connective tissue, and melanomas are abnormal growths of pigment (melanin) cells. Malignant tumors originating from epithelial tissue, e.g., in skin, bronchi, and stomach, are termed carcinomas. Malignancies of epithelial glandular tissue such as are found in the breast, prostate, and colon, are known as adenocarcinomas. Malignant growths of connective tissue, e.g., muscle, cartilage, lymph tissue, and bone, are called sarcomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are malignancies arising among white blood cells. Through the process of metastasis, tumor cell migration to other areas of the body establishes neoplasms in areas away from the site of initial appearance. Bone tissues are one of the most favored sites of metastases of malignant tumors, occurring in about 30% of all cancer cases. Among malignant tumors, cancers of the lung, breast, prostate or the like are particularly known to be likely to metastasize to bone. In the context of a solid tumor (for example, a neuroendocrine tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, salivary cancer, pancreatic cancer, adenocystic cancer, adrenal cancer, esophageal cancer, renal cancer, leiomyosarcoma, or paraganglioma, including advanced solid tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma, inhibition may be assessed by inhibition or retarding of disease progression, inhibition of tumor growth, reduction or regression of primary and/or secondary tumor (s), relief of tumor-related symptoms, improvement in quality of life, inhibition of tumor secreted factors (including tumor secreted hormones, such as those that contribute to carcinoid syndrome), reductions in endocrine hormone markers (for example, chromogranin, gastrin, serotonin, and/or glucagon), delayed appearance or recurrence of primary or secondary tumors, slowed development of primary and/or secondary tumors, decreased occurrence of primary and/or secondary tumors, slowed or decreased severity of secondary effects of disease, arrested tumor growth and/or regression of tumors, increased Time To Progression (TTP), increased Progression Free Survival (PFS), increased Overall Survival (OS), among others. OS as used herein means the time from randomization until death from any cause, and is measured in the intent-to-treat population. TTP as used herein means the time from randomization until objective tumor progression; TTP does not include deaths. As used herein, PFS means the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death. In one embodiment, PFS rates will be computed using the Kaplan-Meier estimates. In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention or chemoprevention. In this context, the term “prevention” includes either preventing the onset of clinically evident solid tumor (for example, a neuroendocrine tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, salivary cancer, pancreatic cancer, adenocystic cancer, adrenal cancer, esophageal cancer, renal cancer, leiomyosarcoma, or paraganglioma, including advanced solid tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma altogether or preventing the onset of a preclinically evident stage of a solid tumor (for example, a neuroendocrine tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, salivary cancer, pancreatic cancer, adenocystic cancer, adrenal cancer, esophageal cancer, renal cancer, leiomyosarcoma, or paraganglioma, including advanced solid tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Also intended to be encompassed by this definition is the prevention of transformation into malignant cells or to arrest or reverse the progression of premalignant cells to malignant cells. This includes prophylactic treatment of those at risk of developing a solid tumor (for example, a neuroendocrine tumor, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, salivary cancer, pancreatic cancer, adenocystic cancer, adrenal cancer, esophageal cancer, renal cancer, leiomyosarcoma, or paraganglioma, including advanced solid tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or multiple myeloma. An “advanced solid tumor” as used herein, means a solid tumor that has spread locally, or metastasized or spread to another part of the body. In certain embodiments, the treatment may be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) (see Thereasse P., et al. New Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors. J. of the National Cancer Institute; 2000; (92) 205-216 and Eisenhauer E. A., Therasse P., Bogaerts J., et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). European J. Cancer; 2009; (45) 228-247). Overall responses for all possible combinations of tumor responses in target and non-target lesions with our without the appearance of new lesions are as follows: Target lesions Non-target lesions New lesions Overall response CR CR No CR CR Incomplete No PR response/SD PR Non-PD No PR SD Non-PD No SD PD Any Yes or no PD Any PD Yes or no PD Any Any Yes PD CR = complete response; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease; and PD = progressive disease. With respect to the evaluation of target lesions, complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter, progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started. With respect to the evaluation of non-target lesions, complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; incomplete response/stable disease (SD) is the persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, and progressive disease (PD) is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. In certain embodiments, the treatment of lymphoma may be assessed by the International Workshop Criteria (IWC) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (see Cheson B D, Pfistner B, Juweid, M E, et. al. Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. J. Clin. Oncol: 2007: (25) 579-586), using the response and endpoint definitions shown below: Response Definition Nodal Masses Spleen, liver Bone Marrow CR Disappearance (a) FDG-avid or PET Not palpable, Infiltrate cleared on of all evidence positive prior to therapy; nodules repeat biopsy; if of disease mass of any size permitted disappeared indeterminate by if PET negative morphology, immunohisto- (b) Variably FDG-avid or chemistry PET negative; regression should be to normal size on CT negative PR Regression of ≧50% decrease in SPD of ≧50% Irrelevant if measurable up to 6 largest dominant decrease in positive prior disease and no masses; no increase in size SPD of to therapy; cell new sites of other nodes nodules (for type should be (a) FDG-avid or PET single nodule specified positive prior to therapy; in greatest one or more PET positive transverse at previously involved site diameter); no (b) Variably FDG-avid or increase in PET negative; regression size of liver on CT or spleen SD Failure to (a) FDG-avid or PET attain CR/PR positive prior to therapy; or PD PET positive at prior sites of disease and no new sites on CT or PET (b) Variably FDG-avid or PET negative; no change in size of previous lesions on CT PD or Any new Appearance of a new ≧50% New or relapsed lesion or lesion(s) ≧1.5 cm in any increase recurrent disease increase by axis, ≧50% increase in from nadir in involvement ≧50% of SPD of more than one the SPD of previously node, any previous involved sites or ≧50% increase in lesions from nadir longest diameter of a previously identifed node ≧1 cm in short axis Lesions PET positive if FDG-avid lymphoma or PET positive prior to therapy Abbreviations: CR, complete remission; FDG, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose; PET, positron emission tomography; CT, computed tomography; PR, partial remission; SPD, sum of the product of the diameters; SD, stable disease; PD, progressive disease.

In one embodiment, the end point for lymphoma is evidence of clinical benefit. Clinical benefit may reflect improvement in quality of life, or reduction in patient symptoms, transfusion requirements, frequent infections, or other parameters. Time to reappearance or progression of lymphoma-related symptoms can also be used in this end point. In certain embodiments, the treatment of multiple myeloma may be assessed by the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (IURC) (see Durie B G M, Harousseau J-L, Miguel J S, et al. International uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma. Leukemia, 2006; (10) 10: 1-7), using the response and endpoint definitions shown below: Response Subcategory Response Criteriaa sCR CR as defined below plus Normal FLC ratio and Absence of clonal cells in bone marrowb by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescencec CR Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and <5% plasma cells in bone marrowb VGPR Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M- protein plus urine M-protein level <100 mg per 24 h PR ≧50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by ≧90% or to <200 mg per 24 h If the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, d a ≧50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria If serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, and serum free light assay is also unmeasurable, ≧50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was ≧30% In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a ≧50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required SD (not recommended for use Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or progressive disease as an indicator of response; stability of disease is best described by providing the time to progression estimates) Abbreviations: CR, complete response; FLC, free light chain; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; sCR, stringent complete response; VGPR, very good partial response; aAll response categories require two consecutive assessments made at anytime before the institution of any new therapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; bConfirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed; cPresence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the κ/λ ratio. An abnormal κ/λ ratio by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of >4:1 or <1:2. dMeasurable disease defined by at least one of the following measurements: Bone marrow plasma cells ≧30%; Serum M-protein ≧1 g/dl (≧10 gm/l)[10 g/l]; Urine M-protein ≧200 mg/24 h; Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≧10 mg/dl (≧100 mg/l); provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal. The procedures, conventions, and definitions described below provide guidance for implementing the recommendations from the Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group regarding response criteria for high-grade gliomas (Wen P., Macdonald, D R., Reardon, D A., et al. Updated response assessment criteria for highgrade gliomas: Response assessment in neuro-oncology working group. J Clin Oncol 2010; 28: 1963-1972). Primary modifications to the RANO criteria for Criteria for Time Point Responses (TPR) can include the addition of operational conventions for defining changes in glucocorticoid dose, and the removal of subjects' clinical deterioration component to focus on objective radiologic assessments. The baseline MRI scan is defined as the assessment performed at the end of the post-surgery rest period, prior to re-initiating compound treatment. The baseline MRI is used as the reference for assessing complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Whereas, the smallest SPD (sum of the products of perpendicular diameters) obtained either at baseline or at subsequent assessments will be designated the nadir assessment and utilized as the reference for determining progression. For the 5 days preceding any protocol-defined MRI scan, subjects receive either no glucocorticoids or are on a stable dose of glucocorticoids. A stable dose is defined as the same daily dose for the 5 consecutive days preceding the MRI scan. If the prescribed glucocorticoid dose is changed in the 5 days before the baseline scan, a new baseline scan is required with glucocorticoid use meeting the criteria described above. The following definitions will be used. Measurable Lesions: Measurable lesions are contrast-enhancing lesions that can be measured bidimensionally. A measurement is made of the maximal enhancing tumor diameter (also known as the longest diameter, LD). The greatest perpendicular diameter is measured on the same image. The cross hairs of bidimensional measurements should cross and the product of these diameters will be calculated. Minimal Diameter: T1-weighted image in which the sections are 5 mm with 1 mm skip. The minimal LD of a measurable lesion is set as 5 mm by 5 mm. Larger diameters may be required for inclusion and/or designation as target lesions. After baseline, target lesions that become smaller than the minimum requirement for measurement or become no longer amenable to bidimensional measurement will be recorded at the default value of 5 mm for each diameter below 5 mm. Lesions that disappear will be recorded as 0 mm by 0 mm. Multicentric Lesions: Lesions that are considered multicentric (as opposed to continuous) are lesions where there is normal intervening brain tissue between the two (or more) lesions. For multicentric lesions that are discrete foci of enhancement, the approach is to separately measure each enhancing lesion that meets the inclusion criteria. If there is no normal brain tissue between two (or more) lesions, they will be considered the same lesion. Nonmeasurable Lesions: All lesions that do not meet the criteria for measurable disease as defined above will be considered non-measurable lesions, as well as all nonenhancing and other truly nonmeasurable lesions. Nonmeasurable lesions include foci of enhancement that are less than the specified smallest diameter (ie., less than 5 mm by 5 mm), nonenhancing lesions (eg., as seen on T1-weighted post-contrast, T2-weighted, or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images), hemorrhagic or predominantly cystic or necrotic lesions, and leptomeningeal tumor. Hemorrhagic lesions often have intrinsic T1-weighted hyperintensity that could be misinterpreted as enhancing tumor, and for this reason, the pre-contrast T1-weighted image may be examined to exclude baseline or interval sub-acute hemorrhage. At baseline, lesions will be classified as follows: Target lesions: Up to 5 measurable lesions can be selected as target lesions with each measuring at least 10 mm by 5 mm, representative of the subject's disease; Non-target lesions: All other lesions, including all nonmeasurable lesions (including mass effects and T2/FLAIR findings) and any measurable lesion not selected as a target lesion. At baseline, target lesions are to be measured as described in the definition for measurable lesions and the SPD of all target lesions is to be determined. The presence of all other lesions is to be documented. At all post-treatment evaluations, the baseline classification of lesions as target and non-target lesions will be maintained and lesions will be documented and described in a consistent fashion over time (eg., recorded in the same order on source documents and eCRFs). All measurable and nonmeasurable lesions must be assessed using the same technique as at baseline (e.g., subjects should be imaged on the same MRI scanner or at least with the same magnet strength) for the duration of the study to reduce difficulties in interpreting changes. At each evaluation, target lesions will be measured and the SPD calculated. Non-target lesions will be assessed qualitatively and new lesions, if any, will be documented separately. At each evaluation, a time point response will be determined for target lesions, non-target lesions, and new lesion. Tumor progression can be established even if only a subset of lesions is assessed. However, unless progression is observed, objective status (stable disease, PR or CR) can only be determined when all lesions are assessed. Confirmation assessments for overall time point responses of CR and PR will be performed at the next scheduled assessment, but confirmation may not occur if scans have an interval of <28 days. Best response, incorporating confirmation requirements, will be derived from the series of time points. The term “contacting” or “contact” is meant to refer to bringing together of a therapeutic agent and cell or tissue such that a physiological and/or chemical effect takes place as a result of such contact. Contacting can take place in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo. In one embodiment, a therapeutic agent is contacted with a cell in cell culture (in vitro) to determine the effect of the therapeutic agent on the cell. In another embodiment, the contacting of a therapeutic agent with a cell or tissue includes the administration of a therapeutic agent to a subject having the cell or tissue to be contacted. Techniques for characterizing crystal forms and amorphous forms include, but are not limited to, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), single-crystal X-ray diffractometry, vibrational spectroscopy, e.g., infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, solid-state and solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, optical microscopy, hot stage optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron crystallography and quantitative analysis, particle size analysis (PSA), surface area analysis, solubility measurements, dissolution measurements, elemental analysis, and Karl Fischer analysis. Characteristic unit cell parameters may be determined using one or more techniques such as, but not limited to, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction, including single-crystal diffraction and powder diffraction. Techniques useful for analyzing powder diffraction data include profile refinement, such as Rietveld refinement, which may be used, e.g., to analyze diffraction peaks associated with a single phase in a sample comprising more than one solid phase. Other methods useful for analyzing powder diffraction data include unit cell indexing, which allows one of skill in the art to determine unit cell parameters from a sample comprising crystalline powder. Unless otherwise specified, to the extent that there is a discrepancy between a depicted chemical structure of a compound provided herein and a chemical name of a compound provided herein, the chemical structure shall control. 5.2 Compound 1 The solid forms, formulations and methods of use provided herein relate to solid forms (e.g., cocrystals) of Compound 1: having the name 7-(6-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-1-((trans)-4-methoxycyclohexyl)-3,4-dihydropyrazino[2,3-b]pyrazin-2(1H)-one, including tautomers thereof.

It should be noted that if there is a discrepancy between a depicted structure and a name given that structure, the depicted structure is to be accorded more weight. In addition, if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it. 5.3 Solid Form Cocrystals of Compound 1 While not intending to be bound by any particular theory, certain solid form cocrystals are characterized by physical properties, e.g., stability, solubility and dissolution rate, appropriate for pharmaceutical and therapeutic dosage forms. Moreover, while not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, certain solid form cocrystals are characterized by physical properties (e.g., density, compressibility, hardness, morphology, cleavage, stickiness, solubility, water uptake, electrical properties, thermal behavior, solid-state reactivity, physical stability, and chemical stability) affecting particular processes (e.g., yield, filtration, washing, drying, milling, mixing, tableting, flowability, dissolution, formulation, and lyophilization) which make certain solid form cocrystals suitable for the manufacture of a solid dosage form.

The plates were mounted on a Bruker GADDS diffractometer equipped with a Hi-Star area detector. The XRPD platform was calibrated using Silver Behenate for the long d-spacings and Corundum for the short d-spacings. Data collection was carried out at room temperature using monochromatic CuKα radiation in the 20 region between 1.5° and 41.5°, which is the most distinctive part of the XRPD pattern. The diffraction pattern of each well was collected in two 2θ ranges (1.5°≦2θ≦21.5° for the first frame, and 19.5°≦2θ≦41.5° for the second frame) with an exposure time of 90 s for each frame. No background subtraction or curve smoothing was applied to the XRPD patterns. The carrier material used during XRPD analysis was transparent to X-rays and contributed only slightly to the background. DSC analyses were performed on a DSC822e instrument (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Switzerland). The DSC822e was calibrated for temperature and enthalpy with a small piece of indium (m.p. is 156.6° C.; ΔHf is 28.45 J/g). Samples were sealed in standard 40 μl aluminum pans, pin-holed and heated in the DSC from 25° C. to 300° C., at a heating rate of 10° C./min. Dry N2 gas, at a flow rate of 50 ml/min was used to purge the DSC equipment during measurement. The cycling DSC's were measured in standard 40 μl aluminum pans, pin-holed and heated in the DSC from 25° C. to 190° C., then cooled back to 25° C. The heating and cooling rate was 10° C./min. Dry N2 gas, at a flow rate of 50 ml/min was used to purge the DSC equipment during measurement. TGA/SDTA analysis was adopted to determine mass loss caused by solvent or water loss from crystals. Monitoring the sample weight, during heating in a TGA/SDTA851e instrument (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Switzerland), results in a weight vs. temperature curve. The TGA/SDTA851e was calibrated for temperature with indium and aluminum. Samples were weighed into 100 μL aluminum crucibles and sealed. The seals were pin-holed and the crucibles heated in the TGA from 25° C. to 300° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min. Dry N2 gas was used for purging. The gases evolved from the TGA samples were analyzed by a mass spectrometer Omnistar GSD 301 T2 (Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH, Germany). The latter is a quadrupole mass spectrometer, which analyses masses in the range of 0-200 amu. Digital images were automatically collected for all the wells of each well-plate, employing a Philips PCVC 840K CCD camera controlled by Crystallics Photoslider software. FTIR spectra were recorded on a ThermoFischer Scientific FT-IR: Nicolet 6700. Morphology analysis of the samples was carried out on an Olympus microscope. Small amounts of samples were dispersed in mineral oil on a glass slide with cover slips and viewed with 20× or 50× magnification. Hygroscopicity was determined on a Surface Measurement Systems DVS. Typically a sample size of 2-10 mg was loaded into the DVS instrument sample pan and the sample was analyzed on a DVS automated sorption analyzer at room temperature. The relative humidity was increased from 0% to 90% RH at 10% RH step then 95% RH. The relative humidity was then decreased in a similar manner to accomplish a full adsorption/desorption cycle. For selected hydrated forms, the analysis started at 50% RH and increased to 90% RH at 10% RH step. The relative humidity was then decreased in a similar manner to 0% RH followed by increasing to 50% RH. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was performed according to the conditions in Table 1 and gradient program in Table 2.

Crystal16® multiple-reactor system (Avantium Technologies) holds 16 (4×4) standard HPLC glass vials (11.5 mm diameter, flat bottomed, 1.8 mL volume). A unit consists of four independently heated aluminum reactor blocks encased in a robust bench top setup. These blocks are electrically heated and cooled by a combination of Peltier elements and a cryostat. In order to prevent condensation of water on the reactor blocks and electronics during runs at temperatures below 10° C., the Crystal16® system provides an inlet for a dry purge gas (typically nitrogen). Operating Parameters are provided in Table 3. TABLE 3 Operating Parameters of Crystal16 ® multiple-reactor system Temperature range −15° C. to 150° C.

Based on the chemical structure of Compound 1, 10 different coformers were selected (Table 5). The cocrystal formation experiments were performed as described in §6.3. Physical stability of all samples was studied by exposing all solids to accelerated ageing conditions (40° C./75% RH for 48 hours) followed by re-analysis by XRPD and digital imaging. After exposure to accelerated ageing conditions, all solids were re-classified on the basis of their new XRPD patterns. The assignment of solid forms was primarily based on the XRPD analysis. The cocrystals formed with fumaric acid (Form 1 and Form 2), benzoic acid (Form 3 and Form 4), gentisic acid (Form 5 and Form 6) and maleic acid (Form 7 and Form 8) appear to be stable at accelerated aging conditions (40° C. and 75% RH, 48 hours). TGMS, FTIR and HPLC analysis of the potential cocrystals from fumaric acid, benzoic acid, gentisic acid and maleic acid confirmed that these XRPD patterns belong to new cocrystals of Compound 1. Of those cocrystals only the crystal with fumaric acid (Form 1) is a non-solvated anhydrous cocrystal. More complex crystal structures for instance were found in the other fumaric acid cocrystal (Form 2), which turned out to be a monohydrate of the fumaric acid cocrystal of Compound 1. The above described results clearly demonstrates that co-crystals between Compound 1 and both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids can be formed. Concluding remarks per analysis of these solids are given in Table 4.

Form 2 crystal structure was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. In contrast with Form 1, Form 2 appears to be a fumaric acid cocrystal of Compound 1 fumarate salt, which has also one molecule of water per unit. The FT-IR spectrum (see FIG. 10 and FIG. 11) clearly shows a doubled shift at around 1800-1600 cm−1 indicating the interaction of two molecules of fumaric acid with the nitrogens of Compound 1. TGMS analysis of Form 4, Form 6 and Form 7 revealed that these co-crystals are solvated (see FIG. 21, FIG. 32 and FIG. 38). HPLC analysis of Form 6 and Form 8, showed the presence of an impurity with a retention time of 6.05 min in HPLC analysis (see FIG. 34 and FIG. 45). Further research is needed to identify the nature and cause of the impurity. Although the XRPD pattern of Form 3 is unique, the SDTA signal does not support the presence of a single solid phase. The FTIR spectra (see FIG. 19 and FIG. 20) of Form 3 showed peak shifts; however; their interpretation is rather complicated. LCMS analysis of Form 3 showed that Compound 1 is present in the sample, which is 99.9% pure (see FIG. 18). 6.3 Experimental Methods In total, 324 experiments were performed, including 126 cooling evaporative experiments, 66 slurry experiments, 66 powder in saturated solution experiments and 66 grinding experiments. In all methods, 11 solvents (see Table 6) and 10 coformers were tested (see Table 5), including 6 blank experiments per method. The coformers and the solvents used were the same for all four methods, while the solvents per method differed due to differences in solubility of Compound 1 in the solvents. The coformers have been selected on the basis of their H-bonding capability, diversity, pharmaceutical acceptability and solubility in the proposed solvents. An overview of the combination of methods and solvents used is provided in Table 5 and Table 6. The solvents used in the polymorph screen were either HPLC or reagent grade.

Compound 1 free base (the starting material) and coformers were solid dosed in 1.8 mL experimental vials. A suitable volume of solvent was added to reach a close-to saturated solution. Following, the HPLC vials were capped and placed in the Crystal16® system to undergo the temperature profile as described in Table 7. Also 6 control experiments were performed. At the end of the temperature profile, the solids were separated from the liquids, dried and analyzed by XRPD and digital imaging. The mother liquids after separation of solids were evaporated and the remaining solids analyzed by XRPD and digital imaging too.

FIG. 10 provides an FTIR overlay of Compound 1 (top), Form 2 (middle) and fumaric acid (bottom). The overlay indicates that the main shifts take place in the spectra in the region 1800-1500 cm−1 and 1600-1400 cm−1. FIG. 11 provides an FTIR overlay of Compound 1 (top), Form 2 (middle) and fumaric acid (bottom) in the region of 1800-400 cm−1. The overlay emphasizes the area between 1800-1500 cm−1 and 1600-1400 cm−1 corresponding to tertiary amines shifts where the H-bonding is taking place between the coformer and Compound 1. FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 clearly show a doubled shift at around 1800-1600 cm−1 indicating the interaction of two molecules of fumaric acid with the nitrogens of Compound 1. The crystal structure of Form 2 was successfully determined from the single crystal X-ray diffraction data. Compound 1 is protonated and forms a fumarate salt; the salt is also H-bonded with another molecule of fumaric acid forming a fumarate co-crystal of a fumarate salt. Moreover, a water molecule was also determined forming H-bonds with Compound 1. FIG. 12 provides a representative way of the bonds formed by Compound 1 with fumaric acid and water. FIG. 12 depicts the molecular structure and atom numbering scheme for protonated Compound 1 and its chemical first co-ordination sphere with nitrogen 13(b) being protonated (see FIG. 12). The crystal structure of Form 2 comprises of 5 chemically different components: Compound 1 as free base, Compound 1 with protonated nitrogen atom named nitrogen 13(b), fumaric acid, fumarate anion and water. These components exist in the following ratio: 1 (Compound 1):1 (Compound 1·H+):1.5 (fumaric acid):1 (fumaric acid anion):1 (water). FIG. 13 shows the crystal packing and H-bond scheme of Form 2. Different components found in the asymmetric unit are marked by different colors (Compound 1·H+-green, Compound 1—red, fumaric acid-blue, fumaric acid anion—orange and water—purple). The H-bond pattern is presented below in Table 14. The closed packing has almost no void for solvent molecules besides water. The fumaric acid bonds to Compound 1 tertiary nitrogens to form the fumarate co-crystal. The fumarate salt is also formed at a nitrogen atom (N13b).

The following is an example of an assay that can be used to determine the TOR kinase inhibitory activity of solid forms of Compound 1. A solid form of Compound 1 is dissolved in DMSO and prepared as 10 mM stocks and diluted appropriately for the experiments. Reagents are prepared as follows: “Simple TOR buffer” (used to dilute high glycerol TOR fraction): 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT. Invitrogen recombinant TOR enzyme (cat #PV4753) is diluted in this buffer to an assay concentration of 0.200 μg/mL. ATP/Substrate solution: 0.075 mM ATP, 12.5 mM MnCl2, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM β-GOP, 250 nM Microcystin LR, 0.25 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 3.5 μg/mL GST-p70S6. Detection reagent solution: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.01% BSA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 12.7 μg/mL Cy5-αGST Amersham (Cat#PA92002V), 9 ng/mL α-phospho p70S6 (Thr389) (Cell Signaling Mouse Monoclonal #9206L), 627 ng/mL α-mouse Lance Eu (Perkin Elmer Cat#AD0077). To 20 μL of the Simple TOR buffer is added 0.5 μL of test solid form in DMSO. To initiate the reaction 5 μL of ATP/Substrate solution is added to 20 μL of the Simple TOR buffer solution (control) and to the compound solution prepared above. The assay is stopped after 60 minutes by adding 5 μL of a 60 mM EDTA solution; 10 μL of detection reagent solution is then added and the mixture is allowed to sit for at least 2 hours before reading on a Perkin-Elmer Envision Microplate Reader set to detect LANCE Eu TR-FRET (excitation at 320 μm and emission at 495/520 nm). DNA-PK Assay. DNA-PK assay is performed using the procedures supplied in the Promega DNA-PK assay kit (catalog #V7870). DNA-PK enzyme can be purchased from Promega (Promega cat#V5811). 6.5 Formulation Examples Certain formulations comprising solid forms of Compound 1 are prepared and tested for a number of physical and chemical properties. Modifications are then made and subsequent formulations are also tested, until formulations possessing desirable physical and chemical properties are found. The following example describes these formulations and their testing. A solid form of Compound 1 is formulated as tablets containing about 5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg of a solid form of Compound 1 as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The excipients and carriers that are used in the tablet formulations are summarized in Table 22, along with their intended functions. TABLE 22 Pharmaceutical Acceptable Excipients and Carriers Ingredients Function Lactose monohydrate, NF (Fast Flo 316) Diluent Microcrystalline cellulose, NF (Avicel pH 101) Diluent/binder Microcrystalline cellulose, NF (Avicel pH 102) Diluent/binder Corn starch, NF Disintegrant/lubricant Pregelatinized starch, NF (Starch 1500) Binder/Disintegrant Lactose anhydrous, NF Diluent Croscarmellose sodium, NF (Ac-Di-Sol) Disintegrant Stearic acid, NF Lubricant Magnesium Stearate, NF Lubricant General Method for Tablet Preparation. Tablets are produced at batch size ranging from 0.5 to 2.2 kg. A solid form of Compound 1 is first mixed/blended with binders, diluent(s), and/or disintegrant (e.g., lactose monohydrate (NF), croscarmellose sodium (NF), and/or microcrystalline cellulose (NF)) using a Globepharma 4-8 quart Bin Blender. The mixture is then sieved via 18 mesh screen. The sieved mixture is further mixed/blended with a Globepharma 4-8 quart Bin Blender. After lubricant(s) (e.g., stearic acid (NF) and/or magnesium stearate (NF)) are sieved via 30 mesh screen, the lubricant(s) are then added to the mixture. The resulting mixture is then mixed/blended with a Globepharma 4-8 quart Bin Blender. The mixture is then compressed into tablets with a rotary table press, and then coated in an Ohara 8″ pan. The tablets thus produced are evaluated for their powder characteristics, tablet characteristics, drug product photostability/short term stability, and manufacturing process. Tablet formulations I to VIII of a solid form of Compound 1 are summarized in Table 23 to Table 30. The process parameters for tablet preparation (blending/compression) are summarized in Table 31 and Table 32. The addition of stearic acid in Formulations V to VIII can improve lubrication without impacting disintegration and compressibility. Lactose monohydrate, NF (Fast Flo 316) can be used as an alternate diluent.
