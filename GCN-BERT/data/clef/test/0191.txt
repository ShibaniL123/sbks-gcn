FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to molecular diagnostic methods. Specifically, in the present invention, colorectal cancer is diagnosed from the quantification by PCR of specific bacterial DNA sequences present in the feces. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in Europe and in United States, and is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Europe, with over 400,000 new cases and 200,000 deaths in 2008. These data reflect that preventive measures need to be taken. The most effective and economic measure to reduce CRC incidence and mortality are CRC risk screening test, thus an improvement of the sensitivity from actual screening methods is required. For this reason, it is crucial a better understanding of the CRC etiology to find the key biomarker for CRC risk screening. The genetic basis and natural history of CRC are well defined, considering that less than 5 % of CRCs are hereditary, and majority are sporadic, diagnosed in patients with no personal or family history of colonic neoplasm. The etiology of this disease is still unknown, although a multifactorial origin in which endogenous and exogenous factors are actively involved in tumor development is suspected. These factors are: age, tobacco, personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, diet, lifestyle, and more recently microbiota. Lately, it has been shown that bacterial communities in the colonic mucosa of CRC patients differ from healthy individuals and the intestinal microbiota has been proposed as a determining agent in the development and progression of CRC along its stages (Chen W et al. Human intestinal lumen and mucosa-associated microbiota in patients with colorectal cancer. PLoS One. 2012;7(6):e39743; Zhu Q et al. The role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Tumour Biol. 2013 Jun;34(3):1285-300; Ahn J et al. Human gut microbiome and risk for colorectal cancer. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2013 Dec 18;105(24):1907-11). The problem to be solved can be seen in the provision of a reliable method for diagnosing colorectal cancer from human feces samples. The present invention, as defined in the claims, provides a solution to this problem. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the present invention, specific bacterial sequences associated to diagnostic of colorectal cancer and diagnostic of risk of developing colorectal cancer have been identified. One preferred embodiment is a Method for diagnosing colorectal cancer from a human feces sample, comprising: (a) determining by quantitative PCR in said human feces sample the concentration of at least one 16S rDNA bacterial sequences selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 7 and SEQ ID NO: 10, wherein SEQ ID NO: 1 concentration is determined using primers with at least 90% identity with respect to SEQ ID NO: 2-3, SEQ ID NO: 4 concentration is determined using primers with at least 90% identity with respect to SEQ ID NO: 5-6, SEQ ID NO: 7 concentration is determined using primers with at least 90% identity with respect to SEQ ID NO: 8-9 and SEQ ID NO: 10 concentration is determined using primers with at least 90% identity with respect to SEQ ID NO: 11-12,(b) determining at least one of the ratios of concentrations selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 10/SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 7/SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 4/SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 7/SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 10/SEQ ID 1 and(c) diagnosing colorectal cancer from the concentration of at least one of the sequences of step (a) and/or the value of at least one ratio obtained in step (b), herewith, method of the invention. In the present application, the sequence identified by SEQ ID NO: 1 is also identified as "B3". Similarly, SEQ ID NO: 4 is also identified as "B10", SEQ ID NO: 7 is also identified as "B46" and SEQ ID NO: 10 is also identified as "B48". B3, B10, B46 and B48 were the names used by the inventors of the present application to identify the sequences during performance of all experiments carried out to arrive at the present invention. The sequences identified by SEQ ID NO: 1, 4, 7 and 10 are available in public sequences databases under the following accesion numbers: GQ411111.1 (SEQ ID NO: 1), GQ411118.1 (SEQ ID NO: 4), GQ411150.1 (SEQ ID NO: 7), GQ411152.1 (SEQ ID NO: 10). However, the presence of said sequences has not been identified in human feces samples and a method of diagnosing cancer colorectal cancer from a human feces sample based on the determination by quantitative PCR of the concentration of these sequences, using the primers defined in the claims of the present application, has not been suggested in the prior art. In the present application, a problem sequence has 95% identity with respect to a determined sequence if 95% of residues of the problem sequence are identical to the residues of the determined sequence. In the present application, the ratio of concentrations of the sequences SEQ ID NO: 10/SEQ ID NO: 4 is obtained by dividing the concentration of the sequence identified by SEQ ID NO: 10 by the concentration of the sequence identified by SEQ ID NO: 4. The ratio could also be obtained by dividing the Ct value of the sequence identified by SEQ ID NO: 10 by the Ct value of the sequence identified by SEQ ID NO: 4. The meaning of Ct is explained in Example 3. The rest of the ratios indicated in the claims shall be calculated accordingly. The method of the invention is a potent tool to prevent colorectal cancer through an early stage disease diagnostic.

EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION Example 1: Patient samples and identification of bacterial markers. In example 3, a total of 16 samples of feces in 7 controls and 9 colorectal cancer patients have been analyzed. In example 4, a total of 8 individuals with Lynch Syndrome (with genetic increased risk to develop colorectal cancer) were analyzed. All individuals had a colonoscopy, in the maximum period of one year, before the fecal sample collection. According to endoscopic exam 4 of them had had malign polyp (named as High Risk) and 4 had not any polyp (named as Low Risk). The following bacterial markers have been identified in said human samples: 16S rDNA bacterial sequence SEQ ID NO: 1 (B3)16S rDNA bacterial sequence SEQ ID NO: 4 (B10)16S rDNA bacterial sequence SEQ ID NO: 7 (B46)16S rDNA bacterial sequence SEQ ID NO: 10 (B48) Example 2. Primer design The primers of the present invention (SEQ ID NO: 2-3, SEQ ID NO: 5-6, SEQ ID NO: 8-9 and SEQ ID NO: 11-12) have been designed from the comparative analysis with sequences previously obtained from phylogenetic groups using bioinformatics tools: ClustalX, Netprimer and PrimerExpress. Said primers have been designed for the quantification of the bacterial markers cited in Example 1 by quantitative PCR. The detection system chosen was SybrGreen® or similar. Set of primers with less than 3 positions different with respect to groups nearby were discarded. Set of primers with Tm values in dissociation curves different of expected ones were also discarded. Example 3: Quantitative PCR methods and results in colorectal cancer patients The quantification of each of the bacteria markers cited in Example 1 in feces samples analyzed is expressed in Ct values. The Ct (cycle threshold) is defined as the number of q-PCR cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold. Ct levels are inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample (ie the lower the Ct level the greater the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample). WVDL real time assays undergo 40 cycles of amplification. The obtained results are shown below, in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 represents Ct absolute values and Table 2 represents Ct ratios. Table 1.
