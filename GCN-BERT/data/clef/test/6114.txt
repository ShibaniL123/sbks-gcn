FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention is defined in the appended claims. Other aspects of the disclosure are provided for reference and to put the invention into context. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Macrocycles are an important therapeutic class of antibiotics. These compounds are frequently produced as a family of closely related biogenetic congeners. The Tiacumicins are a series of 18-membered macrocyclic antibiotics in which the macrocyclic ring is glycosidically attached to one or two sugars. As shown in Table 1, a seven-carbon sugar (R1) is esterified at various positions with small fatty acids. The other sugar (R2), when present, is esterified with an isomer of substituted benzoic acid such as everninic acid (Journal of Liquid Chromatography, 1988, 11: 191-201). Tiacumicins are a family of related compounds that contain the 18-membered ring shown in Formula I below. At present, several distinct Tiacumicins have been identified and six of these (Tiacumicin A-F) are defined by their particular pattern of substituents R1, R2, and R3 (See, e.g., US Patent No. 4,918,174; J. Antibiotic, 1987, 40: 575-588), as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Substituents Present In Tiacumcins A-FR1R2R3AHHBOHCOHDOHEOHFOH More recently, a group of related substances were discovered and described in the U.S. patent application publication number US2007-105791 and include the following. Tiacumicins can be produced by bacteria, including Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subspecies hamdenensis, which may be obtained from the ARS Patent Collection of the Northern Regional Research Center, United States Department of Agriculture, 1815 North University Street, Peoria, IL 61604, accession number NRRL 18085. The characteristics of strain AB 718C-41 are given in J. Antibiotics, 1987, 40: 567-574 and US Patent No. 4,918,174. Tiacumicins show activity against a variety of bacterial pathogens and in particular against C. difficile, a Gram-positive bacterium (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991, 1108-1111). C. difficile is an anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that causes an infection of the bowel. Diarrhea is the most common symptom but abdominal pain and fever may also occur. C. difficile is a major causative agent of colitis (i.e., inflammation of the colon) and diarrhea that may occur following antibiotic intake. This bacterium is primarily acquired in hospitals and chronic care facilities. Because Tiacumicin B shows promising activity against C. difficile, it is expected to be useful in the treatment of bacterial infections, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract, in mammals. Examples of such treatments include but are not limited to treatment of colitis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Tiacumicins may also find use for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. Tiacumicin antibiotics are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,918,174 (issued Apr. 17, 1990), J. Antibiotics, 1987, 40: 575-588, J. Antibiotics, 1987, 40: 567-574, J. Liquid Chromatography, 1988, 11 : 191-201, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 1991, 35: 1108-1111, U.S. Patent No. 5,583,115 (issued Dec. 10, 1996), and U.S. Patent No. 5,767,096 (issued Jun. 16, 1998) Related compounds are the Lipiarmycin antibiotics (c.f., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1987, 1353-1359 and J. Antibiotics 1988, 41: 308-315) and the Clostomicin antibiotics (J. Antibiotics 1986, 39: 1407-1412). Babakhani et al. (Program and Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, vol. 47, page 212) describes activity of OPT-80 and its major hydrolysis metabolite, OP-1118.

Definitions As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term "antibiotic-associated condition" refers to a condition resulting when antibiotic therapy disturbs the balance of the microbial flora of the gut, allowing pathogenic organisms such as enterotoxin producing strains of C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens to flourish. These organisms can cause diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and colitis and are manifested by diarrhea, urgency, abdominal cramps, tenesmus, and fever among other symptoms. Diarrhea, when severe, causes dehydration and the medical complications associated with dehydration. As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term "asymmetrically substituted" refers to a molecular structure in which an atom having four tetrahedral valences is attached to four different atoms or groups. The commonest cases involve the carbon atom. In such cases, two optical isomers (D- and L- enantiomers or R- and S- enantiomers) per carbon atom result which are nonsuperposable mirror images of each other. Many compounds have more than one asymmetric carbon. This results in the possibility of many optical isomers, the number being determined by the formula 2n, where n is the number of asymmetric carbons. As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the terms "biohydrolyzable carbamate," "biohydrolyzable carbonate," "biohydrolyzable ureide" and "biohydrolyzable phosphate" mean a carbamate, carbonate, ureide and phosphate, respectively, of a compound that either: 1) does not interfere with the biological activity of the compound but can confer upon that compound advantageous properties in vivo, such as uptake, duration of action, or onset of action; or 2) is biologically inactive but is converted in vivo to the biologically active compound. Examples of biohydrolyzable carbamates include, but are not limited to, lower alkylamines, substituted ethylenediamines, aminoacids, hydroxyalkylamines, heterocyclic and heteroaromatic amines, and polyether amines. As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term "biohydrolyzable ester" means an ester of a compound that either: 1) does not interfere with the biological activity of the compound but can confer upon that compound advantageous properties in vivo, such as uptake, duration of action, or onset of action; or 2) is biologically inactive but is converted in vivo to the biologically active compound.

Compound of the Invention The compound of the invention is a metabolite of Tiacumicin B having the structure of Formula II, wherein the isopropylcarboxy group on the sugar of Tiacumicin B has been cleaved: The compound of Formula II may exist in free form or in the form of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In certain embodiments, the compound of the invention is a metabolite of R-Tiacumicin B, (i.e., the compound of Formula II). In certain embodiments, the compound of Formula II is racemic and can be represented by the compound of Formula IIa. In other embodiments, the compound of Formula II is substantially stereomerically pure and can be illustrated by the compound of Formula II. Therapeutic and Prophylactic Uses of the Compound of the Invention The invention encompasses a compound of Formula II that is effective in treating disorders associated with bacterial infections, specifically GI infections caused by toxin producing strains of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens). In another embodiment of the invention is the selective effect of the compound of Formula II on C. difficile similar to that of the parent compound, OPT-80, and was as active as vancomycin against C. difficile. Disclosed are methods of treating antibiotic- associated conditions including administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula II or Formula IIa or a salt thereof or a composition comprising such compound to a subject in need thereof. Disclosed are methods of treating a condition resulting when antibiotic therapy disturbs the balance of the microbial flora of the gut, allowing pathogenic organisms such as enterotoxin producing strains of C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens to flourish. The method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula II or Formula IIa or a salt thereof or a composition comprising such compound to a subject in need thereof. Disclosed are methods of treating disorders associated with the abnormal growth of C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens in the intestinal tract and in certain embodiments in a subject taking antibiotics or other antimicrobial drugs. Disorders that can be treated or prevented by the present methods include symptoms ranging from diarrhea to life-threatening inflammations of the colon, and include, but are not limited to, pseudomembranous colitis - severe inflammations of the colon, and colitis manifested by diarrhea, urgency, abdominal cramps, tenesmus, and fever among other symptoms. Diarrhea, when severe, causes dehydration and the medical complications associated with dehydration. Further disorders associated with C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens that can be treated with a compound of Formula II or a compound of Formula IIa or a salt thereof or a composition comprising such a compound include, but are not limited to, bouts of watery diarrhea, often with nausea and abdominal pain and cramping, colitis or pseudomembranous colitis, profuse watery diarrhea - 10 or more bowel movements a day, fever, often greater than 101 °F, abdominal pain, which may be severe, blood or pus in the stool, nausea, dehydration, and weight loss In certain embodiments, subjects can develop C, difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens infections during or shortly after a course of antibiotics, but signs and symptoms may not appear for weeks or even months after treatment has stopped. The compounds and composition of the invention are useful for long-term treatment and to prevent the recurrence of a bacterial infection or a disorder associated with a bacterial infection. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that when a subject takes an antibiotic to treat an infection, it often destroys these beneficial bacteria as well as the bacteria that are causing the illness. Without enough healthy bacteria, dangerous pathogens such as C. difficile can quickly grow out of control. Once C. difficile takes hold it can produce virulent toxins that attack the lining of the intestine. The toxins destroy cells and produce pseudomembranes - telltale patches (plaques) of inflammatory cells and decaying cellular debris on the interior surface of the colon. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that almost any antibiotic can cause harmful bacteria to proliferate in the intestine, but ampicillin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins are most often implicated in C. difficile infections. The use of broad-spectrum drugs that target a wide range of bacteria and the taking of antibiotics for a prolonged period increase the chance of infection. Other antimicrobials, including antiviral and antifungal drugs and chemotherapy medications also can lead to an increased risk of infection with C. difficile. Accordingly, the compound of the invention is useful in treating infection, for example a bacterial infection, caused by abnormal growth of C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens and/or treating or preventing disorders associated with abnormal growth of C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens. Disclosed are methods of treating infection, for example a bacterial infection, including but not limited to, a bacterial infection caused by C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens and/or treating or preventing disorders associated with C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens comprising administering to a subject, preferably to a mammal in need of said treatment or prevention a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula II or Formula IIa or a salt thereof or a composition including such a compound. In one embodiment, a composition of the invention is administered to a mammal, preferably a human, with a disorder associated with anaerobic and microaerophilic GI flora. In another embodiment, a composition of the invention is administered to a mammal, preferably a human, with an infection caused by C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens. In another embodiment, a composition of the invention is administered to a mammal, preferably a human, with a C. diffccile, S. aureus and/or C. perfringens associated disorder. In one embodiment, "treatment", or "treating" refers to an amelioration of a disease or disorder, or at least one discernible symptom thereof, associated with a bacterial infection associated with abnormal growth of anaerobic and microaerophilic GI flora or C. difficile, S. aureus and C. perfringens. In another embodiment, "treatment" or "treating" refers to an amelioration of at least one measurable physical parameter, not necessarily discernible by the subject in need of the treatment. In yet another embodiment, "treatment" or "treating" refers to inhibiting the progression of a disease or disorder, either physically, for example, stabilization of a discernible symptom, physiologically, for example, stabilization of a physical parameter, or both, hi yet another embodiment, "treatment" or "treating" refers to delaying the onset of a disease or disorder. In certain embodiments, the compositions of the invention are administered to a subject, preferably a human, as a preventative measure against such diseases. As used herein, "prevention" or "preventing" refers to a reduction of the risk of acquiring a given disease or disorder. In a preferred mode of the embodiment, the compositions of the invention are administered as a preventative measure to a subject, preferably a human having a predisposition to a bacterial infection or disorder associated with abnormal growth of anaerobic and microaerophilic GI flora or C. difficile, S. aureus and/or C. perfringens. Therapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions Due to the activity of the compounds of Formula II and Formula IIa and.salts thereof, the compounds are advantageously useful in veterinary and human medicine. As described above, the compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment or prevention of a disorder associated with anaerobic and microaerophilic GI flora, C. difficile, or a disorder associated with C. difficile, S. aureus and/or C. perfringens. In some embodiments, the subject has abnormal/altered gut flora but does not exhibit or manifest any physiological symptoms associated with abnormal growth of anaerobic and microaerophilic GI flora, C. difficile, S. aureus and/or C. perfringens, or a disorder associated with C. difficile, S. aureus and/or C. perfringens. The disclosure encompasses methods of treatment and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of Formula II. The disclosure also encompasses methods of treatment and prophylaxis by contacting the gut or GI tract of a subject with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula II or Formula IIa or a salt thereof. The subject is a mammal, including, but not limited, to an animal such a cow, horse, sheep, pig, chicken, turkey, quail, cat, dog, mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, and is more preferably a human. The compositions, which comprise a compound of Formula II, may be administered orally. The compounds of the invention may also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa) and may be administered together with another biologically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, for example, encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer a compound of Formula II, Formula IIa, or a salt thereof. Also described are Methods of administration which include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectally, by inhalation, or topically, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The preferred mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner, and will depend in-part upon the site of the medical condition. In most instances, administration will not result in the release of the compounds of the invention into the bloodstream. For example, after multiple dose oral administrations, low MCC levels of Formula II were detected in plasma, most of which fell below the limit of quantification. By contrast, fecal levels of Formula II in the studies were extremely high, exceeding 1,000 times its MIC values versus C. difficile. However, in certain embodiments in may be useful to administer the compounds of the invention systemically. Accordingly, in other embodiments, administration will result in the release of the compounds of the invention into the bloodstream. It may be desirable to administer one or more compounds of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment. This may be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, for example, in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. In one embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of an atherosclerotic plaque tissue. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, for example, by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. The compounds of the invention can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and vehicles such as triglycerides. The compounds of the invention can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533; Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid.). The compounds of the invention can be delivered in a controlled release system. For instance a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574). Polymeric materials can also be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71:105). In yet another example, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of the target of the compounds of the invention, e.g., the liver, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled-release systems discussed in the review by Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533) may be used. The compositions will contain a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula II, Formula IIa or a salt thereof, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. In a specific embodiment, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term "vehicle" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered. Such pharmaceutical vehicles can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical vehicles can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used. When administered to a patient, the compounds of the invention and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles are preferably sterile. Water is a preferred vehicle when the compound of the invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid vehicles, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles also include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. The compounds of the invention can also be administered in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. The pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle may be a capsule. (See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical vehicles are described in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" by A.R. Gennaro. In a certain embodiment, the compounds of Formula II are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compounds of the invention for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions may also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration may optionally include a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the compound of the invention is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the compound of the invention is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration. The compositions of the invention can be administered orally. Compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions may contain one or more optionally agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions may be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compounds of the invention. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero-order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard vehicles such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Such vehicles are preferably of pharmaceutical grade. The amount of a compound of the invention that will be effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition disclosed herein will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the compositions will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances.

The 4.81 min peak was also found in the HPLC diagram of the crude material of OPT-80 production after fermentation. Example 2. Formula II Biological Activity Bacterial strains: Most bacterial strains were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). A few clinical isolates of Staphylococcus and vancomycin resistant Enterococci were purchased from Christiana Care Health System (Wilmington, DE) and were identified by Biomerieux API identification system (Durham, NC). Antimicrobial compounds: OPT-80 and Formula II were produced by Optimer Pharmaceuticals. Vancomycin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Formula II profiling The MIC of OPT-80 and its major metabolite, Formula II, against anaerobic and aerobic GI bacteria was determined using the CLSI standard susceptibility testing methods. Agar dilution method : (1) This method was used for anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidiobacteria, Prevotella. Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella) and microaerophilic Lactobacillus spp, all of which were purchased form American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): 1. Two fold dilutions of compounds were made in Brucella agar supplemented with hemin, vitamin K and 5% laked sheep blood to achieve a final concentration range from 0.016 µg/mL to 16 µg/mL.2. Using the direct colony suspension method, bacterial inocula were prepared with densities close to a 0.5 McFarland standard (~108 CFU/mL), followed by spotting of the inocula onto agar plates using a Steers replicator to deliver ~105 CFU/spot.3. Plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 35°C for 48 hours. For the Lactobacillus strains, Mueller Hinton Agar and an incubation atmosphere of 5% CO2 were used.4. The lowest concentration of an antibiotic showing no growth or marked reduction in growth was read as the MIC. Microbroth dilution method: This susceptibility method was used for aerobic and facultative organisms (Esclaerichia, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Haemophilus. Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus): 1. Two fold serial dilutions of compounds were made in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth to achieve a concentration range from 0.125 µg/mL to 64 µg/mL.2. Using the direct colony suspension method, bacterial inocula at 0.5 McFarland standard were diluted and inoculated into each microtiter plate to a final density of approximately 5 x 105 CFU/mL (or 5 x 104 CFU/well).3. The microtiter plates were incubated for 16-24 hours (depending on the organism) at 35°C in ambient air.4. The MIC was read as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. Effect of fecal material on the in vitro activity of OPT-80 and Formula II: The in vitro activity of OPT-80, Formula II, and vancomycin against C. difficile ATCC 700057 was measured in the presence and absence of feces using microbroth dilution susceptibility testing methods according to the CLSI guidelines as is recommended for the B. fragilis. The Brucella broth media (BB) used for the experiment was supplemented with hemin (5 µg/mL) and vitamin K (1). The fecal slurry was prepared according to the method described by Swanson et al (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. 35(6): 1108-1111; J of Antibiotics. XLII (1): 94-101). 1. Briefly, a 5% fecal slurry was prepared by adding 5.5 gram of fresh human fecal sample into 1-10 ml BB, followed by homogenization for approximately 10 minutes.2. The slurry was aliquoted into separate tubes containing 2x the desired top concentrations of the following drugs: OPT-80, Formula II, vancomycin (VAN), or no drug (Preparations A-F and I, respectively).3. Similar preparations of the above drugs in BB without feces were also prepared as controls for the experimental procedure (Preparations E-G and J, respectively). Preparation A: Feces-supplemented BB + 32 µg/mL OPT-80Preparation B: Feces-supplemented BB + 256 µg/mL Formula IIPreparation C: Feces-supplemented BB + 256 µg/mL VANPreparation E: Unsupplemented BB + 32 µg/mL OPT-80Preparation F: Unsupplemented BB + 256 µg/mL Formula IIPreparation G: Unsupplemented BB + 256 µg/mL VANPreparation I: Feces-supplemented BB, drug-freePreparation J: Unsupplemented BB, drug -free Following 30 minutes incubation at room temperature, all preparations were centrifuged to remove solid material, filtered once through a 1.2 µm micro fiber glass pre-filter, and filtered three times through 0.2 µm filter devices. The filtrate materials from preparations A-C were serially diluted across the length of 96-well microtiter plates using the 5% fecal slurry filtrate (i.e. Preparation I) as the diluent. The filtrate materials from Preparation E-G were serially diluted across the length of 96 well microtiter plates using BB (Preparation J) as the diluent. The plates were transferred to an anaerobic glove box and were allowed to equilibrate for 4 hours to the anaerobic environment. Bacterial inocula were prepared by harvesting bacteria from overnight culture and preparing a 0.5 McFarland suspension into feces-supplemented or unsupplemented BB. Prepared inocula were then added to plates containing serially diluted drugs, resulting in a 1:2 dilution of drugs to give the desired final concentration. The microtiter plates were incubated for ~48 hours at 35°C under anaerobic conditions, and the MIC was read as the lowest drug concentration at which there was no visible growth. Results of Formula II profiling Formula II, similar to the parent compound, demonstrated antimicrobial activity against some gram positive bacteria (including C. difficile, C. perfringenes, B. longum, F. magna, P. asaccharolyticus, P. anaerobius, M. micros and the microaerophilic L. casei), albeit with MIC values that were four to sixteen fold greater than those of OPT-80. With regards to other gram positive organisms such as S. aureus, E. faecium and L. rhamnosus, Formula II demonstrated in vitro activity with MICs of >16 µg/mL. This clearly demonstrates Formula II can be used as a very narrow spectrum antibiotic against C. difficile.Table 1.

Thus, after oral administration, both parent and metabolite are present at levels far in excess of their MIC values versus C. difficile (Figure 1). Formula II is present in the gut after oral dosing with OPT-80 at levels far in excess (1,000 times) of their MIC values vs. C. difficile.Table 2: MIC data for OPT-80 and Formula II for a panel of aerobic bacteriaAerobic Panel MIC (µg/mL) IICompoundORG 83 E. faecalis ATCC 29212ORG 84 E. faecium ATCC 700221 VREORG 85 E. faecium ATCC 19434ORG 97 S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 33591ORG 98 S. aureus (MSSA) ATCC 29213ORG 99 S. epidermidis ATCC 12228ORG 101 S. pyogenes ATCC 19615OPT-802-44888416-32Formula II16-64>32>64>64>64>32>32Table 3: MIC data for OPT-80 and Formula II for a panel of anaerobic bacteriaAerobic Panel MIC (µg/mL)CompoundORG 830 C. difficile ATCC 700057ORG 150 B. fragilis 25285OPT-800.030, 0.06>16Formula II0.5-1>16 Effect of fecal material on in vitro activity of OPT-80 and Formula II: The effect of fecal material on the antimicrobial activity of Opt-80, Formula II and Vancomycin, which is the only FDA approved treatment for CDAD, was evaluated vs. C. difficile ATCC strain 700057 (Table 3). In the presence of 5% fecal material, a similar fold increase in MIC values was observed for all three drugs; OPT-80 (2 µg/ml; eight fold), Formula II (4µg/ml; four fold) and vancomycin (8 µg/ml; four fold). The in vitro data demonstrates that even in the presence of fecal material both the metabolite and OPT-80 have better or similar in vitro activity compared to Vancomycin, the approved treatment for CDAD. Furthermore, the average fecal concentration of OPT-80 following oral administration has been shown to be over 1,400 µg/g of stool (6), a level far in excess of the MIC even in the presence of fecal material.
