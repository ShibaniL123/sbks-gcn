The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions based on new anticholinergics and EGFR-kinase inhibitors, processes for preparing them and their use in the treatment of respiratory complaints. Surprisingly, an unexpectedly beneficial therapeutic effect, particulady a synergistic effect can be observed in the treatment of inflammatory and/or obstructive diseases of the respiratory tract if one or more, preferably one, anticholinergic of formula ! is used with one or more, preferably one, EGFRkinase inhibitor _2. In view of this synergistic effect the pharmaceutical combinations according to the invention can be used in smaller doses than would be the case with the individual compounds used in monotherapy in the usual way. The combinations of active substances according to the invention are surprisingly characterised both by a rapid onset of activity and also by a longlasting duration Of activity. This is very important to the patient's feeling of well-being, as on the one hand they experience a rapid improvement in their condition once the combination has been administered and on the other hand the drug need only be taken once a day, thanks to its long-lasting effects. These effects are observed both when the active substances are administered simultaneously within a single active substance formulation and also when the two active substances are administered successively in separate formulations. It is preferable according to the invention to administer the two active ingredients simultaneously in a single formulation. Within the scope of the present invention the anticholinergics used are the salts of formula ! Me\+/Me X N wherein Xdenotes an anion with a single negative charge, preferably an anion selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide, iodide, sulphate, phosphate, methanesulphonate, nitrate, maleate, acetate, citrate, fumarate, tartrate, oxalate, succinate, benzoate and p-toluenesulphonate. Preferably, the salts of formula ! are used wherein X - denotes an anion with a single negative charge selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide, 4-toluenesulphonate and methenesu]phonate, preferably bromide. Most preferably, the salts of formula "1 are used wherein X - denotes an anion with a single negative charge selected from the group consisting of chloride, bromide and methanesulphonate, preferably bromide. Particularly preferred acoording to the invention is the salt of formula 1 wherein X - denotes bromide. The salts of formula I are known from International Patent Application WO. 02/32899. Within the scope of the present patent application, an explicit reference to the pharmacologically active cation of formula Me\+.,Me N can be recognised by the use of the designation 15 Any reference to compounds ! naturally includes a reference to the cation t_'.

Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention relates to phan"naceutical compositions in the form of propellantdriven aerosols as hereinbefore described combined with one or more inhalers suitable for administering these aerosols. In addition, the present invention relates to inhalers which are characterised in that they contain the propellant gas-containing aerosols described above according to the invention. The present invention also relates to cartridges which are fitted with a suitable valve and can be used in a suitable inhaler and which contain one of the above-mentioned propellant gas-containing inhalation aerosols according to the invention. Suitable cartridges and methods of filling these cartridges with the inhalable aerosols containing propellant gas according to the invention are known from the prior art. C) Propellant-free inhalable solutions or suspensions containing the combinations of active substances 1_and 2 according to the invention: It is particularly preferred to use the active substance combination according to the invention in the form of propellant-free inhalable solutions and suspensions. The solvent used may be an aqueous or alcoholic, preferably an ethanolic solution. The solvent may be water on its own or a mixture of water and ethanol. The relative proportion of ethanol compared with water is not limited but the maximum is up to 70 percent by volume, more partieutarly up to 60 percent by volume and most preferably up to 30 percent by volume. The remainder of the volume is made up of water. The solutions or suspensions containing "land 2, separately or together, are adjusted to a pH of 2 to 7, preferably 2 to 5, using suitable acids. The pH may be adjusted using acids selected from inorganic or organic acids. Examples of particularly suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid and/or phosphoric acid. Examples of particularly suitable organic acids include ascorbic acid, citric acid, manic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, sucoinic acid, fumaric acid, acetic acid, formic acid and/or propionic acid etc. Preferred inorganic acids are hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. It is also possible to use the acids which have already formed an acid addition salt with one of the active substances. Of the organic acids, ascorbic acid, fumaric acid and citric acid are preferred. If desired, mixtures of the above acids may be used, particularly in the case of acids which have other properties in addition to their acidifying qualities, e.g. as flavourings, antioxidents or complaxing agents, such as citric acid or ascorbic acid, for example. According to the invention, it is particularly preferred to use hydrochloric acid to adjust the pH. According to the invention, the addition of editic acid (EDTA) or one of the known salts thereof, sodium edetate, as stabiliser or complexing agent is unnecessary in the present formulation. Other embodiments may contain this compound or these compounds. In a preferred embodiment the content based on sodium edetate is less than 100 mg/100ml, preferably less than 50mg/100ml, more preferably less than 20mg/lO0mL Generally, inhalable solutions in which the content of sodium edetate is from 0 to 10mg/100ml are preferred. Co-sorvents and/or other excipients may be added to the propellant-free inhalable solutions according to the invention. Preferred co-solvents are those which contain hydroxyl groups or other polar groups, e.g. alcohols - particularly isopropyl alcohol, glycols -particulady propylaneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, po!ypropyleneglycol, glycoletber, glycerol, polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. The terms excipients and additives in this context denote any pharmacologically acceptable substance which is not an active substance but which can be formulated with the active substance or substances in the pharmacologically suitable solvent in order to improve the qualitative properties of the active substance formulation. Preferably, these substances have no pharmacological effect or, in connection with the desired therapy, no appreciable orat least no undesirable pharmacological effect. The excipients and additives include, for example, surfactants such as soya lecithin, oleio acid, sorbitan esters, such as polysorbates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, other stabilisers, complexing agents, antioxidants andlor preservatives which guarantee or prolong the shelf life of the finished pharmaceutical formulation, flavourings, vitamins and/or other additives known in the art. The additives also include physiologically acceptable salts such as sodium chloride as isotonic agents. The preferred excipients include antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, for example, provided that it has not already been used to adjust the pH, vitamin A, vitamin E, tocopherols and similar vitamins and provitamins occurring in the human body. Preservatives may be used to protect the formulation from contamination with pathogens. Suitable preservatives are those which are known in the art, particularly eetyl pyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride or benzoic acid or benzoates such as sodium benzoate in the concentration known from the prior art. The preservatives mentioned above are preferably present in concentrations of up to 50mg/100ml, more preferably between 5 and 20mg/100m]. Preferred formulations contain, in addition to the solvent water and the combination of active substances 'land _2, only benzalkonium chloride and sodium edetate. In another preferred embodiment, no sodium edetate is present. The propellant-free inhalable solutions according to the invention are administered in particular using inhalers of the kind which are capable of nebulising a small amount of a liquid formulation in the required therapeutic dose within a few seconds to produce an aerosol suitable for therapeutic inhalation. Within the scope of the present invention, preferred nebulisers are those in which a quantity of less than 100 L, preferably less than 50p.L, more preferably between 20 and 30 L of active substance solution can be nebulised in preferably one spray action to form an aerosol with an average particle size of less than 20pro, preferably less than 10 m, in such a way that the inhalable part of the aerosol corresponds to the therapeutically effective quantity. An apparatus of this kind for propellant-free delivery of a metered quantity of a liquid pharmaceutical composition for inhalation is described for example in International Patent Application WO 91/14468 and also in WO 97/12687 (cf. in particular Figures 6a and 6b). The nebulisers (devices) described therein are known by the name Respimat®. This nebuliser (Respimat ) can advantageously be used to produce the inhalable aerosols according to the invention containing the combination of active substances land _2. Because of its cylindrical shape and handy size of less than 9 to 15 cm long and 2 to 4 cm wide, this device can be carried at all times by the patient. The nebuliser sprays a defined volume of the pharmaceutical formulation at high pressures through small nozzles so as to produce inhalable aerosols. The preferred atomiser essentially consists of an upper housing pad, a pump housing, a nozzle, a locking mechanism, a spring housing, a spring and a storage container, charaoterised by a pump housing which is secured in the upper housing part and which comprises at one end a nozzle body with the nozzle or nozzle arrangement, a hollow plunger with valve body, a power takeoff flange in which the hct[ow plunger is secured and which is located in the upper housing part, - a looking mechanism situated in the upper housing part, - a spring housing with the spring contained therein, which is rotatably mounted on the upper housing part by means of a rotary bearing, a lower housing part which is fitted onto the spring housing in the axial direction. The hollow plunger with valve body corresponds to a device disclosed in WO 97112687. It projects partially into the cylinder of the pump housing and axially movable within the cylinder. Reference is made in particular to Figures 1 to 4, especially Figure 3, and the relevant parts of the description. The hollow plunger with valve body exerts a pressure of 5 to 60 Mpa (about to 600 bar), preferably 10 to 60 Mpa (about 1 go to 600 bar) on the fluid, the measured amount of active substance solution, at its high pressure end at the moment when the spring is actuated. Volumes of 10 to 50 microlitres are preferred, while volumes of 10 to 20 microlitres are particularly preferred and a volume of 15 microlitres per spray is most particularly preferred. The valve body is preferably mounted at the end of the hollow plunger facing the valve body. The nozzle in the nozzle body is preferably microstructured, i.e. produced by microtechnology. Microstructurad valve bodies are disclosed for example in WO-94/07607; reference is hereby made to the contents of this specification, u; ,;x Figure 1 therein and the associated description. The nozzle body consists for example of two sheets of glass and/or silicon firmly joined together, at least one of which has one or more microstructured channels which connect the nozzle inlet end to the nozzle outlet end. At the nozzle outlet end there is at least one round or non-round opening 2 to microns deep and 5 to 15 microns wide, the depth preferably being 4.5 to 6.5 microns while the length is preferably 7 to 9 microns. In the case of a plurality of nozz.le openings, preferably two, the directions of spraying of the nozzles in the nozzle body may extend parallel to one another or may be inclined relative to one another in the direction of the nozzle opening. In a nozzle body with at least two nozzle openings at the outlet end the directions of spraying may be at an angle of 20 to 160° to one another, preferably 60 to 150°, most preferably 80 to 100°. The nozzle openings are preferably arranged at a spacing of 10 to 200 microns, more preferably at a spacing of 10 to 100 microns, most preferably 30 to 70 microns. Spacings of microns are most preferred. The directions of spraying will therefore meet in the vicinity of the nozzle openings. The liquid pharmaceutical preparation strikes the nozzle body with an entry pressure of up to 600 bar, preferably 200 to 300 bar, and is atomised into an inhalable aerosol through the nozzle openings. The preferred particle or droplet sizes of the aerosol are up to 20 microns, preferably 3 to 10 microns. The locking mechanism contains a spring, preferably a cylindrical helical compression spring, as a store for the mechanical energy. The spring acts on the power takeoff flange as an actuating member the movement of which determined by the position of a locking member. The travel of the power takeoff flange is precisely limited by an upper and lower stop. The spdng preferably biased, via a power step-up gear, e.g. a helical thrust gear, by an external torque which is produced when the upper housing part is rotated counter to the spring housing in the lower housing part. In this case, the upper housing part and the power takeoff flange have a single or multiple V-shaped gear. The locking member with engaging locking surfaces is arranged in a ring around the power takeoff flange+ It consists, for example, of a ring of plastic or metal which is inherently radially elastically deformable. The ring is arranged in a plane at right angles to the atomiser axis. After the biasing of the spring, the locking surfaces of the locking member move into the path of the power takeoff flange and prevent the spring from relaxing. The locking member is actuated by means of a button. The actuating button is connected or coupled to the locking member. In order to actuate the locking mechanism, the actuating button is moved parallel to the annular plane, preferably into the atomiser; this causes the deformable ring to deform in the annular plane. Details of the construction of the locking mechanism are given in WO 97/20590. The lower housing part is pushed axially over the spring housing and covers the mounting, the drive of the spindle and the storage container for the fluid. When the atomiser is actuated the upper housing part is rotated relative to the lower housing part, the lower housing part taking the spring housing with it. The spring is thereby compressed and biased by means of the helical thrust gear and the locking mechanism engages automatically. The angle of rotation is preferably a whole-number fraction of 360 degrees, e.g. 180 degrees. At the same time as the spring is biased, the power takeoff part in the upper housing part is moved along by a given distance, the hollow plunger is withdrawn inside the cylinder in the pump housing, as a result of which some of the fluid is sucked out of the storage container and into the high pressure chamber in front of the nozzle. If desired, a number of exchangeable storage containers which contain the fluid to be atomised may be pushed into the atomiser one after another and used in succession. The storage container contains the aqueous aerosol preparation according to the invention. The atomising process is initiated by pressing gently on the actuating button. As a result, the locking mechanism opens up the path for the power takeoff member. The biased spring pushes the plunger into the cylinder of the pump housing. The fluid leaves the nozzle of the atomiser in atomised form. Further details of construction are disclosed in PCT Applications WO 97/12683 and WO 97/20590, to which reference is hereby made. The components of the atomiser (nebuliser) are made of a material which is suitable for its purpose. The housing of the atomiser and, if its operation permits, other parts as well, are preferably made of plastics, e.g. by injection moulding. For medicinal purposes, physiologically safe materials are used. Figures 6a/b of WO 97/12687, to which reference is explicitly made at this point, show the nebuliser (Respimat®) which can advantageously be used for inhaling the aqueous aerosol preparations according to the invention. Figure 6a of WO 97/12687 shows a longitudinal section through the atomiser with the spring biased while Figure 6b of WO 97/12687shows a longitudinal section through the atomiser with the spring relaxed. The upper housing part (51) contains the pump housing (52) on the end of which is mounted the holder (53) for the atomiser nozzle. In the holder is the nozzle body (54) and a filter (55). The hollow plunger (57) fixed in the power takeoff flange (56) of the locking mechanism projects partially into the cylinder of the pump housing. At its end the hollow plunger carries the valve body (58). The hollow plunger is sealed off by means of the seal (59).
