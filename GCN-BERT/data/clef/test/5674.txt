BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In general, exogenous unmodified nucleic acid molecules, particularly viral nucleic acids, introduced into the cell induce an innate immune response which results in cytokine and interferon (IFN) production and ultimately cell death. It is of great interest for therapeutics, diagnostics, reagents and for biological assays to be able to deliver a nucleic acid, e.g., a ribonucleic acid (RNA), into a cell, such as to cause intracellular translation of the nucleic acid and production of the encoded protein instead of generating an innate immune response. Thus, there is a need to develop formulation compositions comprising a delivery agent that can effectively facilitate the in vivo delivery of nucleic acids to targeted cells without generating an innate immune response. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure provides, inter alia, formulation compositions comprising modified nucleic acid molecules which may encode a protein, a protein precursor, or a partially or fully processed form of the protein or a protein precursor.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages will be apparent from the following description of particular embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to the same parts throughout the different views. The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the principles of various embodiments of the invention. FIG. 1 illustrates lipid structures in the prior art useful in the present invention. Shown are the structures for 98N12-5 (TETA5-LAP), DLin-DMA, DLin-K-DMA (2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminomethyl-[1,3]-dioxolane), DLin-KC2-DMA, DLin-MC3-DMA and C12-200.

FIG. 3 is a gel profile of modified mRNA encapsulated in PLGA microspheres. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The delivery of nucleic acids into cells has many undesired complications including the integration of the nucleic acid into the target cell genome which may result in imprecise expression levels, the deleterious transfer of the nucleic acid to progeny and neighbor cells and a substantial risk of causing mutations. The modified nucleic acid molecules of the present disclosure are capable of reducing the innate immune activity of a population of cells into which they are introduced, thus increasing the efficiency of protein production in that cell population. Further, one or more additional advantageous activities and/or properties of the nucleic acids and proteins of the present disclosure are described herein. In addition, provided herein are methods of treating a subject having or being suspected of having a disease, disorder and/or condition the methods comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment a composition described herein in an amount sufficient to treat the disease, disorder and/or condition. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of methods featured in the invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. Modified Nucleic Acid Molecules The present disclosure provides nucleic acids, including RNA such as mRNA, which contain one or more modified nucleosides or nucleotides (termed “modified nucleic acid molecules,” “modified mRNA” or “modified mRNA molecules”) as described herein. The modification of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may have useful properties including, but not limited to, a significant decrease in or a lack of a substantial induction of the innate immune response of a cell into which the modified mRNA is introduced. The modified nucleic acid molecules may also exhibit enhanced efficiency of protein production, intracellular retention of nucleic acids, and viability of contacted cells, as well as having reduced immunogenicity as compared to unmodified nucleic acid molecules. Provided are modified nucleic acid molecules containing a translatable region and one, two, or more than two different nucleoside modifications Exemplary nucleic acids for use in this disclosure include ribonucleic acids (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), threose nucleic acids (TNAs), glycol nucleic acids (GNAs), locked nucleic acids (LNAs) or a hybrid thereof. In preferred embodiments, the modified nucleic acid molecules include messenger RNA (mRNA). As described herein, the modified nucleic acid molecules of the present disclosure may not substantially induce an innate immune response of a cell into which the modified mRNA is introduced. In another embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecule may exhibit reduced degradation, as compared to a nucleic acid that has not been modified, in a cell where the modified nucleic acid molecule is introduced. The term “nucleic acid” includes any compound and/or substance that is or can be incorporated into an oligonucleotide chain. Exemplary nucleic acids for use in accordance with the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, one or more of DNA, cDNA, RNA including messenger RNA (mRNA), hybrids thereof, RNAi-inducing agents, RNAi agents, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, antisense RNA, ribozymes, catalytic DNA, RNA that induce triple helix formation, aptamers, vectors and the like. In certain embodiments, it is desirable to intracellularly degrade a modified nucleic acid molecule introduced into the cell. For example it would be desirable to degrade a modified nucleic acid molecule if precise timing of protein production was desired. Thus, the present disclosure provides a modified nucleic acid molecule containing a degradation domain, which is capable of being acted on in a directed manner within a cell. In some embodiments, the modified nucleic acid molecules may be chemically modified on the sugar, nucleobase (e.g., in the 5′ position of the nucleobase), or phosphate backbone (e.g., replacing the phosphate with another moiety such as a thiophospate). In some embodiments, the modification may result in a disruption of a major groove binding partner interaction, which may contribute to an innate immune response. In some embodiments, the formulation composition, when administered to a subject, can result in improved bioavailability, therapeutic window, or volume of distribution of the modified nucleic acid molecule relative to administration of the modified nucleic acid molecule without the incorporation of the delivery agent. In some embodiments, the modified nucleosides and nucleotides of the modified nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may be synthesized using the O-protected compounds described in International Pub. No. WO2012138530, the contents of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In certain embodiments, the modified nucleic acid molecule may comprise mRNA. In particular embodiments, the modified mRNA (mmRNA) may be derived from cDNA. In certain embodiments, mmRNA may comprise at least two nucleoside modifications. In one embodiment, the nucleoside modifications may be selected from 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine. In another embodiment, at least one of the nucleoside modifications is not 5-methylcytosine and/or pseudouridine. In certain embodiments the delivery agent may comprise formulations allowing for localized and systemic delivery of mmRNA. The formulations of the modified nucleic acids molecules and/or mmRNA may be selected from, but are not limited to, lipidoids, liposomes and lipid nanoparticles, rapidly eliminated lipid nanoparticles, polymers, lipoplexes, peptides and proteins, at least one chemical modification and conjugation, enhancers, and/or cells. In one embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may include at least two stop codons before the 3′ untranslated region (UTR). The stop codon may be selected from TGA, TAA and TAG. In one embodiment, the nucleic acids of the present invention include the stop codon TGA and one additional stop codon. In a further embodiment the addition stop codon may be TAA. In another embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecules may comprise three stop codons. Other components of a nucleic acid are optional in a modified nucleic acid molecule but these components may be beneficial in some embodiments. Untranslated Regions (UTRs) Untranslated regions (UTRs) of a gene are transcribed but not translated. The 5′ UTR starts at the transcription start site and continues to the start codon but does not include the start codon; whereas, the 3′ UTR starts immediately following a stop codon and continues until the transcriptional termination signal. There is growing body of evidence about the regulatory roles played by the UTRs in terms of stability of the nucleic acid molecule and translation. The regulatory features of a UTR can be incorporated into the modified mRNA molecules of the present invention to enhance the stability of the molecule. The specific features can also be incorporated to ensure controlled down-regulation of the transcript in case they are misdirected to undesired organs sites. 5′ UTR and Translation Initiation Natural 5′ UTRs bear features which play roles in for translation initiation. They harbor signatures like Kozak sequences which are commonly known to be involved in the process by which the ribosome initiates translation of many genes. Kozak sequences have the consensus CCR(A/G)CCAUGG (SEQ ID NO: 1), where R is a purine (adenine or guanine) three bases upstream of the start codon (AUG), which is followed by another ‘G’. 5′ UTR also have been known to form secondary structures which are involved in elongation factor binding. By engineering the features typically found in abundantly expressed genes of specific target organs, one can enhance the stability and protein production of the modified mRNA molecules of the invention. For example, introduction of 5′ UTR of liver-expressed mRNA, such as albumin, serum amyloid A, Apolipoprotein A/B/E, transferrin, alpha fetoprotein, erythropoietin, or Factor VIII, could be used to enhance expression of a modified nucleic acid molecule, such as a mmRNA, in hepatic cell lines or liver. Likewise, use of 5′ UTR from other tissue-specific mRNA to improve expression in that tissue is possible for muscle (MyoD, Myosin, Myoglobin, Myogenin, Herculin), for endothelial cells (Tie-1, CD36), for myeloid cells (C/EBP, AML1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CD11b, MSR, Fr-1, i-NOS), for leukocytes (CD45, CD18), for adipose tissue (CD36, GLUT4, ACRP30, adiponectin) and for lung epithelial cells (SP-A/B/C/D). Other non-UTR sequences may be incorporated into the 5′ (or 3′ UTR) UTRs of the modified nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. For example, introns or portions of introns sequences may be incorporated into the flanking regions of the modified mRNA of the invention. Incorporation of intronic sequences may increase protein production as well as mRNA levels. 3′ UTR and the AU Rich Elements 3′ UTRs are known to have stretches of Adenosines and Uridines embedded in them. These AU rich signatures are particularly prevalent in genes with high rates of turnover. Based on their sequence features and functional properties, the AU rich elements (AREs) can be separated into three classes (Chen et al, 1995): Class I AREs contain several dispersed copies of an AUUUA motif within U-rich regions. C-Myc and MyoD contain class I AREs. Class II AREs possess two or more overlapping UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) (SEQ ID NO: 2) nonamers. Molecules containing this type of AREs include GM-CSF and TNF-a. Class III ARES are less well defined. These U rich regions do not contain an AUUUA motif. c-Jun and Myogenin are two well-studied examples of this class. Most proteins binding to the AREs are known to destabilize the messenger, whereas members of the ELAV family, most notably HuR, have been documented to increase the stability of mRNA. HuR binds to AREs of all the three classes. Engineering the HuR specific binding sites into the 3′ UTR of nucleic acid molecules will lead to HuR binding and thus, stabilization of the message in vivo. Introduction, removal or modification of 3′ UTR AU rich elements (AREs) can be used to modulate the stability of modified mRNA of the invention. When engineering specific modified mRNA, one or more copies of an ARE can be introduced to make modified mRNA of the invention less stable and thereby curtail translation and decrease production of the resultant protein. Likewise, AREs can be identified and removed or mutated to increase the intracellular stability and thus increase translation and production of the resultant protein. Transfection experiments can be conducted in relevant cell lines, using modified mRNA of the invention and protein production can be assayed at various time points post-transfection. For example, cells can be transfected with different ARE-engineering molecules and by using an ELISA kit to the relevant protein and assaying protein produced at 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days post-transfection. Incorporating microRNA Binding Sites microRNAs (or miRNA) are 19-25 nucleotide long noncoding RNAs that bind to the 3′ UTR of nucleic acid molecules and down-regulate gene expression either by reducing nucleic acid molecule stability or by inhibiting translation. The modified mRNA of the invention may comprise one or more microRNA target sequences, microRNA sequences, or microRNA seeds. Such sequences may correspond to any known microRNA such as those taught in US Publication US2005/0261218 and US Publication US2005/0059005, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. A microRNA sequence comprises a “seed” region, i.e., a sequence in the region of positions 2-8 of the mature microRNA, which sequence has perfect Watson-Crick complementarity to the miRNA target sequence. A microRNA seed may comprise positions 2-8 or 2-7 of the mature microRNA. In some embodiments, a microRNA seed may comprise 7 nucleotides (e.g., nucleotides 2-8 of the mature microRNA), wherein the seed-complementary site in the corresponding miRNA target is flanked by an adenine (A) opposed to microRNA position 1. In some embodiments, a microRNA seed may comprise 6 nucleotides (e.g., nucleotides 2-7 of the mature microRNA), wherein the seed-complementary site in the corresponding miRNA target is flanked by an adenine (A) opposed to microRNA position 1. See for example, Grimson A, Farh K K, Johnston W K, Garrett-Engele P, Lim L P, Bartel D P; Mol Cell. 2007 Jul. 6; 27(1):91-105; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The bases of the microRNA seed have complete complementarity with the target sequence. By engineering microRNA target sequences into the 3′UTR of modified mRNA of the invention one can target the molecule for degradation or reduced translation, provided the microRNA in question is available. This process will reduce the hazard of off target effects upon nucleic acid molecule delivery. Identification of microRNA, microRNA target regions, and their expression patterns and role in biology have been reported (Bonauer et al., Curr Drug Targets 2010 11:943-949; Anand and Cheresh Curr Opin Hematol 2011 18:171-176; Contreras and Rao Leukemia 2012 26:404-413 (2011 Dec. 20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.356); Bartel Cell 2009 136:215-233; Landgraf et al, Cell, 2007 129:1401-1414; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). For example, if the modified nucleic acid molecule is a modified mRNA and is not intended to be delivered to the liver but ends up there, then miR-122, a microRNA abundant in liver, can inhibit the expression of the gene of interest if one or multiple target sites of miR-122 are engineered into the 3′ UTR of the modified mRNA. Introduction of one or multiple binding sites for different microRNA can be engineered to further decrease the longevity, stability, and protein translation of a modified nucleic acid molecule and/or modified mRNA. As used herein, the term “microRNA site” refers to a microRNA target site or a microRNA recognition site, or any nucleotide sequence to which a microRNA binds or associates. It should be understood that “binding” may follow traditional Watson-Crick hybridization rules or may reflect any stable association of the microRNA with the target sequence at or adjacent to the microRNA site. Conversely, for the purposes of the modified mRNA of the present invention, microRNA binding sites can be engineered out of (i.e. removed from) sequences in which they naturally occur in order to increase protein expression in specific tissues. For example, miR-122 binding sites may be removed to improve protein expression in the liver. Regulation of expression in multiple tissues can be accomplished through introduction or removal or one or several microRNA binding sites. Examples of tissues where microRNA are known to regulate mRNA, and thereby protein expression, include, but are not limited to, liver (miR-122), muscle (miR-133, miR-206, miR-208), endothelial cells (miR-17-92, miR-126), myeloid cells (miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-16, miR-21, miR-223, miR-24, miR-27), adipose tissue (let-7, miR-30c), heart (miR-1d, miR-149), kidney (miR-192, miR-194, miR-204), and lung epithelial cells (let-7, miR-133, miR-126). MicroRNA can also regulate complex biological processes such as angiogenesis (miR-132) (Anand and Cheresh Curr Opin Hematol 2011 18:171-176; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In the modified mRNA of the present invention, binding sites for microRNAs that are involved in such processes may be removed or introduced, in order to tailor the expression of the modified mRNA expression to biologically relevant cell types or to the context of relevant biological processes. Lastly, through an understanding of the expression patterns of microRNA in different cell types, modified mRNA can be engineered for more targeted expression in specific cell types or only under specific biological conditions. Through introduction of tissue-specific microRNA binding sites, modified mRNA could be designed that would be optimal for protein expression in a tissue or in the context of a biological condition. Transfection experiments can be conducted in relevant cell lines, using engineered modified mRNA and protein production can be assayed at various time points post-transfection. For example, cells can be transfected with different microRNA binding site-engineering modified mRNA and by using an ELISA kit to the relevant protein and assaying protein produced at 6 hour, 12 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour, 72 hour and 7 days post-transfection. In vivo experiments can also be conducted using microRNA-binding site-engineered molecules to examine changes in tissue-specific expression of formulated modified mRNA. 5′ Capping The 5′ cap structure of an mRNA is involved in nuclear export, increasing mRNA stability and binds the mRNA Cap Binding Protein (CBP), which is responsible for mRNA stability in the cell and translation competency through the association of CBP with poly(A) binding protein to form the mature cyclic mRNA species. The cap further assists the removal of 5′ proximal introns removal during mRNA splicing. Endogenous mRNA molecules may be 5′-end capped generating a 5′-ppp-5′-triphosphate linkage between a terminal guanosine cap residue and the 5′-terminal transcribed sense nucleotide of the mRNA molecule. This 5′-guanylate cap may then be methylated to generate an N7-methyl-guanylate residue. The ribose sugars of the terminal and/or anteterminal transcribed nucleotides of the 5′ end of the mRNA may optionally also be 2′-O-methylated. 5′-decapping through hydrolysis and cleavage of the guanylate cap structure may target a nucleic acid molecule, such as an mRNA molecule, for degradation. Modifications to the modified mRNA of the present invention may generate a non-hydrolyzable cap structure preventing decapping and thus increasing mRNA half-life. Because cap structure hydrolysis requires cleavage of 5′-ppp-5′ phosphorodiester linkages, modified nucleotides may be used during the capping reaction. For example, a Vaccinia Capping Enzyme from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, Mass.) may be used with α-thio-guanosine nucleotides according to the manufacturer's instructions to create a phosphorothioate linkage in the 5′-ppp-5′ cap. Additional modified guanosine nucleotides may be used such as α-methyl-phosphonate and seleno-phosphate nucleotides. Additional modifications include, but are not limited to, 2′-O-methylation of the ribose sugars of 5′-terminal and/or 5′-anteterminal nucleotides of the mRNA (as mentioned above) on the 2′-hydroxyl group of the sugar ring. Multiple distinct 5′-cap structures can be used to generate the 5′-cap of a nucleic acid molecule, such as an mRNA molecule. Cap analogs, which herein are also referred to as synthetic cap analogs, chemical caps, chemical cap analogs, or structural or functional cap analogs, differ from natural (i.e. endogenous, wild-type or physiological) 5′-caps in their chemical structure, while retaining cap function. Cap analogs may be chemically (i.e. non-enzymatically) or enzymatically synthesized and/or linked to a nucleic acid molecule. For example, the Anti-Reverse Cap Analog (ARCA) cap contains two guanines linked by a 5′-5′-triphosphate group, wherein one guanine contains an N7 methyl group as well as a 3′-O-methyl group (i.e., N7,3′-O-dimethyl-guanosine-5′-triphosphate-5′-guanosine (m7G-3′ mppp-G; which may equivalently be designated 3′ O-Me-m7G(5)ppp(5′)G). The 3′-O atom of the other, unmodified, guanine becomes linked to the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the capped nucleic acid molecule (e.g. an mRNA or mmRNA). The N7- and 3′-O-methlyated guanine provides the terminal moiety of the capped nucleic acid molecule (e.g. mRNA or mmRNA). Another exemplary cap is mCAP, which is similar to ARCA but has a 2′-O-methyl group on guanosine (i.e., N7,2′-O-dimethyl-guanosine-5′-triphosphate-5′-guanosine, m7Gm-ppp-G). While cap analogs allow for the concomitant capping of a nucleic acid molecule in an in vitro transcription reaction, up to 20% of transcripts can remain uncapped. This, as well as the structural differences of a cap analog from an endogenous 5′-cap structures of nucleic acids produced by the endogenous, cellular transcription machinery, may lead to reduced translational competency and reduced cellular stability. Modified mRNA of the present invention may also be capped post-transcriptionally, using enzymes, in order to generate more authentic 5′-cap structures. As used herein, the phrase “more authentic” refers to a feature that closely mirrors or mimics, either structurally or functionally, an endogenous or wild type feature. That is, a “more authentic” feature is better representative of an endogenous, wild-type, natural or physiological cellular function and/or structure as compared to synthetic features or analogs, etc., of the prior art, or which outperforms the corresponding endogenous, wild-type, natural or physiological feature in one or more respects. Non-limiting examples of more authentic 5′ cap structures of the present invention are those which, among other things, have enhanced binding of cap binding proteins, increased half life, reduced susceptibility to 5′ endonucleases and/or reduced 5′ decapping, as compared to synthetic 5′ cap structures known in the art (or to a wild-type, natural or physiological 5′ cap structure). For example, recombinant Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme and recombinant 2′-O-methyltransferase enzyme can create a canonical 5′-5′-triphosphate linkage between the 5′-terminal nucleotide of an mRNA and a guanine cap nucleotide wherein the cap guanine contains an N7 methylation and the 5′-terminal nucleotide of the mRNA contains a 2′-O-methyl. Such a structure is termed the Cap1 structure. This cap results in a higher translational-competency and cellular stability and a reduced activation of cellular pro-inflammatory cytokines, as compared, e.g., to other 5′ cap analog structures known in the art. Cap structures include, but are not limited to, 7mG(5′)ppp(5′)N,pN2p (cap 0), 7mG(5′)ppp(5′)NlmpNp (cap 1), and 7mG(5′)-ppp(5′)N1mpN2 mp (cap 2). Because the modified mRNA may be capped post-transcriptionally, and because this process is more efficient, nearly 100% of the modified mRNA may be capped. This is in contrast to ˜80% when a cap analog is linked to an mRNA in the course of an in vitro transcription reaction. According to the present invention, 5′ terminal caps may include endogenous caps or cap analogs. According to the present invention, a 5′ terminal cap may comprise a guanine analog. Useful guanine analogs include, but are not limited to, inosine, N1-methyl-guanosine, 2′ fluoro-guanosine, 7-deaza-guanosine, 8-oxo-guanosine, 2-amino-guanosine, LNA-guanosine, and 2-azido-guanosine. Viral Sequences Additional viral sequences such as, but not limited to, the translation enhancer sequence of the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV-PAV) can be engineered and inserted in the 3′ UTR of the modified mRNA of the invention and can stimulate the translation of the mRNA in vitro and in vivo. Transfection experiments can be conducted in relevant cell lines at and protein production can be assayed by ELISA at 12 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour, 72 hour and day 7 post-transfection. IRES Sequences Further, provided are modified mRNA which may contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). First identified as a feature Picorna virus RNA, IRES plays an important role in initiating protein synthesis in absence of the 5′ cap structure. An IRES may act as the sole ribosome binding site, or may serve as one of multiple ribosome binding sites of an mRNA. Modified mRNA containing more than one functional ribosome binding site may encode several peptides or polypeptides that are translated independently by the ribosomes (“multicistronic nucleic acid molecules”). When modified mRNA are provided with an IRES, further optionally provided is a second translatable region. Examples of IRES sequences that can be used according to the invention include without limitation, those from picornaviruses (e.g. FMDV), pest viruses (CFFV), polio viruses (PV), encephalomyocarditis viruses (ECMV), foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDV), hepatitis C viruses (HCV), classical swine fever viruses (CSFV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), simian immune deficiency viruses (SIV) or cricket paralysis viruses (CrPV). Poly-A Tails During RNA processing, a long chain of adenine nucleotides (poly-A tail) may be added to a modified nucleic acid molecule such as a modified mRNA molecules in order to increase stability. Immediately after transcription, the 3′ end of the transcript may be cleaved to free a 3′ hydroxyl. Then poly-A polymerase adds a chain of adenine nucleotides to the RNA. The process, called polyadenylation, adds a poly-A tail that can be between, for example, approximately 100 and 250 residues long. It has been discovered that unique poly-A tail lengths provide certain advantages to the modified mRNA of the present invention. Generally, the length of a poly-A tail of the present invention is greater than 30 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the poly-A tail is greater than 35 nucleotides in length (e.g., at least or greater than about 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500, 1,600, 1,700, 1,800, 1,900, 2,000, 2,500, and 3,000 nucleotides). In some embodiments, the modified mRNA includes from about 30 to about 3,000 nucleotides (e.g., from 30 to 50, from 30 to 100, from 30 to 250, from 30 to 500, from 30 to 750, from 30 to 1,000, from 30 to 1,500, from 30 to 2,000, from 30 to 2,500, from 50 to 100, from 50 to 250, from 50 to 500, from 50 to 750, from 50 to 1,000, from 50 to 1,500, from 50 to 2,000, from 50 to 2,500, from 50 to 3,000, from 100 to 500, from 100 to 750, from 100 to 1,000, from 100 to 1,500, from 100 to 2,000, from 100 to 2,500, from 100 to 3,000, from 500 to 750, from 500 to 1,000, from 500 to 1,500, from 500 to 2,000, from 500 to 2,500, from 500 to 3,000, from 1,000 to 1,500, from 1,000 to 2,000, from 1,000 to 2,500, from 1,000 to 3,000, from 1,500 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 2,500, from 1,500 to 3,000, from 2,000 to 3,000, from 2,000 to 2,500, and from 2,500 to 3,000). In one embodiment, the poly-A tail is designed relative to the length of the overall modified mRNA. This design may be based on the length of the coding region, the length of a particular feature or region (such as the flanking regions), or based on the length of the ultimate product expressed from the modified mRNA. In this context the poly-A tail may be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100% greater in length than the modified mRNA, region or feature thereof. The poly-A tail may also be designed as a fraction of modified mRNA to which it belongs. In this context, the poly-A tail may be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90% or more of the total length of the molecule or the total length of the molecule minus the poly-A tail. Further, engineered binding sites and conjugation of modified mRNA for Poly-A binding protein may enhance expression. Additionally, multiple distinct modified mRNA may be linked together to the PABP (Poly-A binding protein) through the 3′-end using modified nucleotides at the 3′-terminus of the poly-A tail. Transfection experiments can be conducted in relevant cell lines at and protein production can be assayed by ELISA at 12 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour, 72 hour and day 7 post-transfection. In one embodiment, the modified mRNA of the present invention are designed to include a polyA-G Quartet. The G-quartet is a cyclic hydrogen bonded array of four guanine nucleotides that can be formed by G-rich sequences in both DNA and RNA. In this embodiment, the G-quartet is incorporated at the end of the poly-A tail. The resultant mmRNA molecule is assayed for stability, protein production and other parameters including half-life at various time points. It has been discovered that the polyA-G quartet results in protein production equivalent to at least 75% of that seen using a poly-A tail of 120 nucleotides alone. Modifications The modified nucleic acids and modified mRNA (mmRNA) of the invention may contain one, two, or more different modifications. In some embodiments, modified nucleic acids and mmRNA may contain one, two, or more different nucleoside or nucleotide modifications. In some embodiments, a modified nucleic acid or mmRNA (e.g., having one or more mmRNA molecules) introduced to a cell may exhibit reduced degradation in the cell, as compared to an unmodified nucleic acid or mmRNA. The modified nucleic acids and mmRNA can include any useful modification, such as to the sugar, the nucleobase (e.g., one or more modifications of a nucleobase, such as by replacing or substituting an atom of a pyrimidine nucleobase with optionally substituted amino, optionally substituted thiol, optionally substituted alkyl (e.g., methyl or ethyl), or halo (e.g., chloro or fluoro), or the internucleoside linkage (e.g., one or more modification to the phosphodiester backbone). In certain embodiments, modifications are present in both the sugar and the internucleoside linkage (e.g., one or modifications, such as those present in ribonucleic acids (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs), threose nucleic acids (TNAs), glycol nucleic acids (GNAs), peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), locked nucleic acids (LNAs) or hybrids thereof). Additional modifications are described herein. As described herein, the modified nucleic acids and mmRNA of the invention do not substantially induce an innate immune response of a cell into which the mRNA is introduced. In certain embodiments, it may desirable to intracellularly degrade a modified nucleic acid molecule or modified nucleic acid molecule introduced into the cell. For example, degradation of a modified nucleic acid molecule or modified mRNA may be preferable if precise timing of protein production is desired. Thus, in some embodiments, the invention provides a modified nucleic acid molecule containing a degradation domain, which is capable of being acted on in a directed manner within a cell. In another aspect, the present disclosure provides nucleic acids comprising a nucleoside or nucleotide that can disrupt the binding of a major groove interacting, e.g. binding, partner with the nucleic acid (e.g., where the modified nucleotide has decreased binding affinity to major groove interacting partner, as compared to an unmodified nucleotide). The modified nucleic acid and mmRNA can optionally include other agents (e.g., RNAi-inducing agents, RNAi agents, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, antisense RNA, ribozymes, catalytic DNA, tRNA, RNA that induce triple helix formation, aptamers, vectors, etc.). In some embodiments, the modified nucleic acids or mmRNA may include one or more messenger RNA (mRNA) and one or more modified nucleoside or nucleotides (e.g., mmRNA molecules). Details for these modified nucleic acids and mmRNA follow.

Modifications on the Sugar The modified nucleosides and nucleotides (e.g., building block molecules), which may be incorporated into a modified nucleic acid or mmRNA (e.g., RNA or mRNA, as described herein), can be modified on the sugar of the ribonucleic acid. For example, the 2′ hydroxyl group (OH) can be modified or replaced with a number of different substituents. Exemplary substitutions at the 2′-position include, but are not limited to, H, halo, optionally substituted C1-6 alkyl; optionally substituted C1-6 alkoxy; optionally substituted C6-10 aryloxy; optionally substituted C3-8 cycloalkyl; optionally substituted C3-8 cycloalkoxy; optionally substituted C6-10 aryloxy; optionally substituted C6-10 aryl-C1-6 alkoxy, optionally substituted C1-12 (heterocyclyl)oxy; a sugar (e.g., ribose, pentose, or any described herein); a polyethyleneglycol (PEG), —O(CH2CH2O)nCH2CH2OR, where R is H or optionally substituted alkyl, and n is an integer from 0 to 20 (e.g., from 0 to 4, from 0 to 8, from 0 to 10, from 0 to 16, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 8, from 1 to 10, from 1 to 16, from 1 to 20, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 8, from 2 to 10, from 2 to 16, from 2 to 20, from 4 to 8, from 4 to 10, from 4 to 16, and from 4 to 20); “locked” nucleic acids (LNA) in which the 2′-hydroxyl is connected by a C1-6 alkylene or C1-6 heteroalkylene bridge to the 4′-carbon of the same ribose sugar, where exemplary bridges included methylene, propylene, ether, or amino bridges; aminoalkyl, as defined herein; aminoalkoxy, as defined herein; amino as defined herein; and amino acid, as defined herein. Generally, RNA includes the sugar group ribose, which is a 5-membered ring having an oxygen. Exemplary, non-limiting modified nucleotides include replacement of the oxygen in ribose (e.g., with S, Se, or alkylene, such as methylene or ethylene); addition of a double bond (e.g., to replace ribose with cyclopentenyl or cyclohexenyl); ring contraction of ribose (e.g., to form a 4-membered ring of cyclobutane or oxetane); ring expansion of ribose (e.g., to form a 6- or 7-membered ring having an additional carbon or heteroatom, such as for anhydrohexitol, altritol, mannitol, cyclohexanyl, cyclohexenyl, and morpholino that also has a phosphoramidate backbone); multicyclic forms (e.g., tricyclo; and “unlocked” forms, such as glycol nucleic acid (GNA) (e.g., R-GNA or S-GNA, where ribose is replaced by glycol units attached to phosphodiester bonds), threose nucleic acid (TNA, where ribose is replace with α-L-threofuranosyl-(3′→2)), and peptide nucleic acid (PNA, where 2-amino-ethyl-glycine linkages replace the ribose and phosphodiester backbone). The sugar group can also contain one or more carbons that possess the opposite stereochemical configuration than that of the corresponding carbon in ribose. Thus, a modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA can include nucleotides containing, e.g., arabinose, as the sugar. Modifications on the Nucleobase The present disclosure provides for modified nucleosides and nucleotides. As described herein “nucleoside” is defined as a compound containing a sugar molecule (e.g., a pentose or ribose) or a derivative thereof in combination with an organic base (e.g., a purine or pyrimidine) or a derivative thereof. As described herein, “nucleotide” is defined as a nucleoside including a phosphate group. The modified nucleotides (e.g., modified mRNA) may by synthesized by any useful method, as described herein (e.g., chemically, enzymatically, or recombinantly to include one or more modified or non-natural nucleosides). The modified nucleotide base pairing encompasses not only the standard adenosine-thymine, adenosine-uracil, or guanosine-cytosine base pairs, but also base pairs formed between nucleotides and/or modified nucleotides comprising non-standard or modified bases, wherein the arrangement of hydrogen bond donors and hydrogen bond acceptors permits hydrogen bonding between a non-standard base and a standard base or between two complementary non-standard base structures. One example of such non-standard base pairing is the base pairing between the modified nucleotide inosine and adenine, cytosine or uracil. The modified nucleosides and nucleotides can include a modified nucleobase. Examples of nucleobases found in RNA include, but are not limited to, adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. Examples of nucleobase found in DNA include, but are not limited to, adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. These nucleobases can be modified or wholly replaced to provide modified nucleic acids or mmRNA molecules having enhanced properties, e.g., resistance to nucleases through disruption of the binding of a major groove binding partner.

Phosphorodithioates have both non-linking oxygens replaced by sulfur. The phosphate linker can also be modified by the replacement of a linking oxygen with nitrogen (bridged phosphoramidates), sulfur (bridged phosphorothioates), and carbon (bridged methylene-phosphonates). The α-thio substituted phosphate moiety is provided to confer stability to RNA and DNA polymers through the unnatural phosphorothioate backbone linkages. Phosphorothioate DNA and RNA have increased nuclease resistance and subsequently a longer half-life in a cellular environment. Phosphorothioate linked modified nucleic acids or mmRNA molecules are expected to also reduce the innate immune response through weaker binding/activation of cellular innate immune molecules. In specific embodiments, a modified nucleoside includes an alpha-thio-nucleoside (e.g., 5′-O-(1-thiophosphate)-adenosine, 5′-O-(1-thiophosphate)-cytidine (α-thio-cytidine), 5′-O-(1-thiophosphate)-guanosine, 5′-O-(1-thiophosphate)-uridine, or 5′-O-(1-thiophosphate)-pseudouridine). Combinations of Modified Sugars, Nucleobases, and Internucleoside Linkages The modified nucleic acids and mmRNA of the invention can include a combination of modifications to the sugar, the nucleobase, and/or the internucleoside linkage. These combinations can include any one or more modifications described herein. For examples, any of the nucleotides described herein in Formulas (Ia), (Ia-1)-(Ia-3), (Ib)-(If), (IIa)-(IIp), (IIb-1), (IIb-2), (IIc-1)-(IIc-2), (IIn-1), (IIn-2), (IVa)-(IV1), and (IXa)-(IXr) can be combined with any of the nucleobases described herein (e.g., in Formulas (b1)-(b43) or any other described herein). Synthesis of Modified Nucleic Acids and mmRNA Molecules The modified nucleic acid and mmRNA molecules for use in accordance with the invention may be prepared according to any useful technique, as described herein. The modified nucleosides and nucleotides used in the synthesis of modified nucleic acid and mmRNA molecules disclosed herein can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. Where typical or preferred process conditions (e.g., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are provided, a skilled artisan would be able to optimize and develop additional process conditions. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures. The processes described herein can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., 1H or 13C) infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), or mass spectrometry, or by chromatography such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography. Preparation of modified nucleic acid and mmRNA molecules of the present invention can involve the protection and deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups can be found, for example, in Greene, et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2d. Ed., Wiley & Sons, 1991, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out in suitable solvents, which can be readily selected by one of skill in the art of organic synthesis. Suitable solvents can be substantially nonreactive with the starting materials (reactants), the intermediates, or products at the temperatures at which the reactions are carried out, i.e., temperatures which can range from the solvent's freezing temperature to the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried out in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the particular reaction step, suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected. Resolution of racemic mixtures of modified nucleosides and nucleotides can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. An example method includes fractional recrystallization using a “chiral resolving acid” which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids. Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art. Modified nucleosides and nucleotides (e.g., binding block molecules) can be prepared according to the synthetic methods described in Ogata et al., J. Org. Chem. 74:2585-2588 (2009); Purmal et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 22(1): 72-78, (1994); Fukuhara et al., Biochemistry, 1(4): 563-568 (1962); and Xu et al., Tetrahedron, 48(9): 1729-1740 (1992), each of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. The modified nucleic acid and mmRNA of the invention need not be uniformly modified along the entire length of the molecule. For example, one or more or all types of nucleotide (e.g., purine or pyrimidine, or any one or more or all of A, G, U, C) may or may not be uniformly modified in a polynucleotide of the invention, or in a given predetermined sequence region thereof. In some embodiments, all nucleotides X in a polynucleotide of the invention (or in a given sequence region thereof) are modified, wherein X may any one of nucleotides A, G, U, C, or any one of the combinations A+G, A+U, A+C, G+U, G+C, U+C, A+G+U, A+G+C, G+U+C or A+G+C Different sugar modifications, nucleotide modifications, and/or internucleoside linkages (e.g., backbone structures) may exist at various positions in the modified nucleic acid or mmRNA. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the nucleotide analogs or other modification(s) may be located at any position(s) of a modified nucleic acid or mmRNA such that the function of the modified nucleic acid or mmRNA is not substantially decreased. A modification may also be a 5′ or 3′ terminal modification. The modified nucleic acid or mmRNA may contain from about 1% to about 100% modified nucleotides, or any intervening percentage (e.g., from 1% to 20%, from 1% to 25%, from 1% to 50%, from 1% to 60%, from 1% to 70%, from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 90%, from 1% to 95%, from 10% to 20%, from 10% to 25%, from 10% to 50%, from 10% to 60%, from 10% to 70%, from 10% to 80%, from 10% to 90%, from 10% to 95%, from 10% to 100%, from 20% to 25%, from 20% to 50%, from 20% to 60%, from 20% to 70%, from 20% to 80%, from 20% to 90%, from 20% to 95%, from 20% to 100%, from 50% to 60%, from 50% to 70%, from 50% to 80%, from 50% to 90%, from 50% to 95%, from 50% to 100%, from 70% to 80%, from 70% to 90%, from 70% to 95%, from 70% to 100%, from 80% to 90%, from 80% to 95%, from 80% to 100%, from 90% to 95%, from 90% to 100%, and from 95% to 100%). In some embodiments, the modified nucleic acid or mmRNA includes a modified pyrimidine (e.g., a modified uracil/uridine or modified cytosine/cytidine). In some embodiments, the uracil or uridine in the modified nucleic acid or mmRNA molecule may be replaced with from about 1% to about 100% of a modified uracil or modified uridine (e.g., from 1% to 20%, from 1% to 25%, from 1% to 50%, from 1% to 60%, from 1% to 70%, from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 90%, from 1% to 95%, from 10% to 20%, from 10% to 25%, from 10% to 50%, from 10% to 60%, from 10% to 70%, from 10% to 80%, from 10% to 90%, from 10% to 95%, from 10% to 100%, from 20% to 25%, from 20% to 50%, from 20% to 60%, from 20% to 70%, from 20% to 80%, from 20% to 90%, from 20% to 95%, from 20% to 100%, from 50% to 60%, from 50% to 70%, from 50% to 80%, from 50% to 90%, from 50% to 95%, from 50% to 100%, from 70% to 80%, from 70% to 90%, from 70% to 95%, from 70% to 100%, from 80% to 90%, from 80% to 95%, from 80% to 100%, from 90% to 95%, from 90% to 100%, and from 95% to 100% of a modified uracil or modified uridine). The modified uracil or uridine can be replaced by a compound having a single unique structure or by a plurality of compounds having different structures (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more unique structures, as described herein). In some embodiments, the cytosine or cytidine in the modified nucleic acid or mmRNA molecule may be replaced with from about 1% to about 100% of a modified cytosine or modified cytidine (e.g., from 1% to 20%, from 1% to 25%, from 1% to 50%, from 1% to 60%, from 1% to 70%, from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 90%, from 1% to 95%, from 10% to 20%, from 10% to 25%, from 10% to 50%, from 10% to 60%, from 10% to 70%, from 10% to 80%, from 10% to 90%, from 10% to 95%, from 10% to 100%, from 20% to 25%, from 20% to 50%, from 20% to 60%, from 20% to 70%, from 20% to 80%, from 20% to 90%, from 20% to 95%, from 20% to 100%, from 50% to 60%, from 50% to 70%, from 50% to 80%, from 50% to 90%, from 50% to 95%, from 50% to 100%, from 70% to 80%, from 70% to 90%, from 70% to 95%, from 70% to 100%, from 80% to 90%, from 80% to 95%, from 80% to 100%, from 90% to 95%, from 90% to 100%, and from 95% to 100% of a modified cytosine or modified cytidine). The modified cytosine or cytidine can be replaced by a compound having a single unique structure or by a plurality of compounds having different structures (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more unique structures, as described herein). In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods of synthesizing a modified nucleic acid or mmRNA including n number of linked nucleosides having Formula (Ia-1): comprising: a) reacting a nucleotide of Formula (IV-1): with a phosphoramidite compound of Formula (V-1): wherein Y9 is H, hydroxy, phosphoryl, pyrophosphate, sulfate, amino, thiol, optionally substituted amino acid, or a peptide (e.g., including from 2 to 12 amino acids); and each P1, P2, and P3 is, independently, a suitable protecting group; and denotes a solid support; to provide a modified nucleic acid or mmRNA of Formula (VI-1): and b) oxidizing or sulfurizing the modified nucleic acid or mmRNA of Formula (V) to yield a modified nucleic acid or mmRNA of Formula (VII-1): and c) removing the protecting groups to yield the modified nucleic acid or mmRNA of Formula (Ia). In some embodiments, steps a) and b) are repeated from 1 to about 10,000 times. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise a nucleotide (e.g., building block molecule) selected from the group consisting of adenosine, cytosine, guanosine, and uracil. In some embodiments, the nucleobase may be a pyrimidine or derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the modified nucleic acid or mmRNA is translatable. Other components of modified nucleic acids and mmRNA are optional, and are beneficial in some embodiments. For example, a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and/or a 3′UTR are provided, wherein either or both may independently contain one or more different nucleoside modifications. In such embodiments, nucleoside modifications may also be present in the translatable region. Also provided are modified nucleic acids and mmRNA containing a Kozak sequence. Exemplary syntheses of modified nucleotides, which are incorporated into a modified nucleic acid or mmRNA, e.g., RNA or mRNA, are provided below in Scheme 1 through Scheme 11. Scheme 1 provides a general method for phosphorylation of nucleosides, including modified nucleosides. Various protecting groups may be used to control the reaction. For example, Scheme 2 provides the use of multiple protecting and deprotecting steps to promote phosphorylation at the 5′ position of the sugar, rather than the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups. Modified nucleotides can be synthesized in any useful manner. Schemes 3, 4, and 7 provide exemplary methods for synthesizing modified nucleotides having a modified purine nucleobase; and Schemes 5 and 6 provide exemplary methods for synthesizing modified nucleotides having a modified pseudouridine or pseudoisocytidine, respectively. Schemes 8 and 9 provide exemplary syntheses of modified nucleotides. Scheme 10 provides a non-limiting biocatalytic method for producing nucleotides. Scheme 11 provides an exemplary synthesis of a modified uracil, where the N1 position is modified with R12b, as provided elsewhere, and the 5′-position of ribose is phosphorylated. T1, T2, R12a, R12b, and r are as provided herein. This synthesis, as well as optimized versions thereof, can be used to modify other pyrimidine nucleobases and purine nucleobases (see e.g., Formulas (b1)-(b43)) and/or to install one or more phosphate groups (e.g., at the 5′ position of the sugar). This alkylating reaction can also be used to include one or more optionally substituted alkyl group at any reactive group (e.g., amino group) in any nucleobase described herein (e.g., the amino groups in the Watson-Crick base-pairing face for cytosine, uracil, adenine, and guanine). Combinations of Nucleotides in mmRNA Further examples of modified nucleotides and modified nucleotide combinations are provided below in Table 2. These combinations of modified nucleotides can be used to form the modified nucleic acids or mmRNA of the invention. Unless otherwise noted, the modified nucleotides may be completely substituted for the natural nucleotides of the modified nucleic acids or mmRNA of the invention. As a non-limiting example, the natural nucleotide uridine may be substituted with a modified nucleoside described herein. In another non-limiting example, the natural nucleotide uridine may be partially substituted (e.g., about 0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99.9%) with at least one of the modified nucleoside disclosed herein.

Synthesis of Modified Nucleic Acid Molecules Modified nucleic acid molecules for use in accordance with the present disclosure may be prepared according to any available technique including, but not limited to, in vitro transcription such as chemical synthesis and enzymatic synthesis, or enzymatic and chemical cleavage of a longer precursor, etc. Methods of synthesizing RNA are known in the art (see, e.g., Gait, M. J. (ed.) Oligonucleotide synthesis: a practical approach, Oxford [Oxfordshire], Washington, D.C.: IRL Press, 1984; and Herdewijn, P. (ed.) Oligonucleotide synthesis: methods and applications, Methods in Molecular Biology, v. 288 (Clifton, N.J.) Totowa, N.J.: Humana Press, 2005; both of which are incorporated herein by reference). The modified nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It is understood that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated.

Different nucleic acid modifications and/or backbone structures may exist at various positions in the nucleic acid. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the nucleotide analogs or other modification(s) may be located at any position(s) of a nucleic acid such that the function of the nucleic acid is not substantially decreased. A modification may also be a 5′ or 3′ terminal modification. The nucleic acids may contain at a minimum one modified nucleotide and at maximum 100% modified nucleotides, or any intervening percentage, such as at least 5% modified nucleotides, at least 10% modified nucleotides, at least 25% modified nucleotides, at least 50% modified nucleotides, at least 80% modified nucleotides, or at least 90% modified nucleotides. For example, the nucleic acids may contain a modified pyrimidine such as uracil or cytosine. In some embodiments, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 80%, at least 90% or 100% of the uracil in the nucleic acid may be replaced with a modified uracil. The modified uracil can be replaced by a compound having a single unique structure, or can be replaced by a plurality of compounds having different structures (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more unique structures). In some embodiments, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 25%, at least 50%, at least 80%, at least 90% or 100% of the cytosine in the nucleic acid may be replaced with a modified cytosine. The modified cytosine can be replaced by a compound having a single unique structure, or can be replaced by a plurality of compounds having different structures (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more unique structures). Generally, the shortest length of a modified mRNA, herein “mmRNA,” of the present disclosure can be the length of an mRNA sequence that may be sufficient to encode for a dipeptide. In another embodiment, the length of the mRNA sequence may be sufficient to encode for a tripeptide. In another embodiment, the length of an mRNA sequence may be sufficient to encode for a tetrapeptide. In another embodiment, the length of an mRNA sequence may be sufficient to encode for a pentapeptide. In another embodiment, the length of an mRNA sequence may be sufficient to encode for a hexapeptide. In another embodiment, the length of an mRNA sequence may be sufficient to encode for a heptapeptide. In another embodiment, the length of an mRNA sequence may be sufficient to encode for an octapeptide. In another embodiment, the length of an mRNA sequence may be sufficient to encode for a nonapeptide. In another embodiment, the length of an mRNA sequence may be sufficient to encode for a decapeptide. Examples of dipeptides that the modified nucleic acid molecule sequences can encode for include, but are not limited to, carnosine and anserine. In a further embodiment, the mRNA may be greater than 30 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the RNA molecule may be greater than 35 nucleotides in length (e.g., at least or greater than about 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500, 1,600, 1,700, 1,800, 1,900, 2,000, 2,500, 3,000, 4,000 and 5,000 nucleotides). Exemplary Properties of Modified Nucleic Acid Molecules Major Groove Interacting Partners The modified nucleic acid molecules, e.g., modified mRNA (mmRNA), described herein can disrupt interactions with recognition receptors that detect and respond to RNA ligands through interactions, e.g. binding, with the major groove face of a nucleotide or nucleic acid. As such, RNA ligands comprising modified nucleotides or modified nucleic acid molecules, as described herein, decrease interactions with major groove binding partners, and therefore decrease an innate immune response, or expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or both. Example major groove interacting, e.g. binding, partners include, but are not limited to, the following nucleases and helicases. Within membranes, TLRs (Toll-like Receptors) 3, 7, and 8 can respond to single- and double-stranded RNA. Within the cytoplasm, members of the superfamily 2 class of DEX(D/H) helicases and ATPases can sense RNA to initiate antiviral responses. These helicases include the RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5). Other examples include laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), HIN-200 domain containing proteins, or Helicase-domain containing proteins. Prevention or Reduction of Innate Cellular Immune Response Activation Using Modified Nucleic Acid Molecules The modified nucleic acid molecules, e.g., mmRNA, described herein, decrease the innate immune response in a cell. The term “innate immune response” includes a cellular response to exogenous nucleic acids, including, but not limited to, single stranded nucleic acids, generally of viral or bacterial origin, which involve the induction of cytokine expression and release, particularly the interferons, and cell death. Protein synthesis may also be reduced during the innate cellular immune response. While it is advantageous to eliminate the innate immune response in a cell, the present disclosure provides modified mRNA that substantially reduce the immune response, including interferon signaling, without entirely eliminating such a response. In some embodiments, the immune response may be reduced by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, or greater than 99.9% as compared to the immune response induced by a corresponding unmodified nucleic acid molecule. Such a reduction can be measured by the expression or activity level of Type 1 interferons or the expression of interferon-regulated genes such as the toll-like receptors (e.g., TLR7 and TLR8). Reduction of the innate immune response can also be measured by decreased cell death following one or more administrations of modified RNA to a cell population; e.g., cell death is 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or over 95% less than the cell death frequency observed with a corresponding unmodified nucleic acid molecule. Moreover, cell death may affect fewer than 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01% or fewer than 0.01% of cells contacted with the modified nucleic acid molecules. The present disclosure provides for the repeated introduction (e.g., transfection) of modified nucleic acid molecules into a target cell population, e.g., in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo. The step of contacting the cell population may be repeated one or more times (such as two, three, four, five or more than five times). In some embodiments, the step of contacting the cell population with the modified nucleic acid molecules may be repeated a number of times sufficient such that a predetermined efficiency of protein translation in the cell population is achieved. Given the reduced cytotoxicity of the target cell population by the nucleic acid modifications, such repeated transfections are achievable in a variety of cell types. The modified nucleic acids of the invention, including the combination of modifications taught herein may have superior properties making them more suitable as therapeutic modalities. It has been determined that the “all or none” model in the art is sorely insufficient to describe the biological phenomena associated with the therapeutic utility of modified mRNA. The present inventors have determined that to improve protein production, one may consider the nature of the modification, or combination of modifications, the percent modification and survey more than one cytokine or metric to determine the efficacy and risk profile of a particular modified mRNA. In one aspect of the invention, methods of determining the effectiveness of a modified mRNA as compared to unmodified involves the measure and analysis of one or more cytokines whose expression is triggered by the administration of the exogenous nucleic acid of the invention. These values are compared to administration of an umodified nucleic acid or to a standard metric such as cytokine response, PolyIC, R-848 or other standard known in the art. One example of a standard metric developed herein is the measure of the ratio of the level or amount of encoded polypeptide (protein) produced in the cell, tissue or organism to the level or amount of one or more (or a panel) of cytokines whose expression is triggered in the cell, tissue or organism as a result of administration or contact with the modified nucleic acid. Such ratios are referred to herein as the Protein:Cytokine Ratio or “PC” Ratio. The higher the PC ratio, the more efficacioius the modified nucleic acid (polynucleotide encoding the protein measured). Preferred PC Ratios, by cytokine, of the present invention may be greater than 1, greater than 10, greater than 100, greater than 1000, greater than 10,000 or more. Modified nucleic acids having higher PC Ratios than a modified nucleic acid of a different or unmodified construct are preferred. The PC ratio may be further qualified by the percent modification present in the polynucleotide. For example, normalized to a 100% modified nucleic acid, the protein production as a function of cytokine (or risk) or cytokine profile can be determined. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for determining, across chemistries, cytokines or percent modification, the relative efficacy of any particular modified polynucleotide by comparing the PC Ratio of the modified nucleic acid (polynucleotide). Activation of the Immune Response: Vaccines In one embodiment of the present invention, mRNA molecules may be used to elicit or provoke an immune response in an organism. The mRNA molecules to be delivered may encode an immunogenic peptide or polypeptide and may encode more than one such peptide or polypeptide. Additionally, certain modified nucleosides, or combinations thereof, when introduced into the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the invention will activate the innate immune response. Such activating molecules are useful as adjuvants when combined with polypeptides and/or other vaccines. In certain embodiments, the activating molecules contain a translatable region which encodes for a polypeptide sequence useful as a vaccine, thus providing the ability to be a self-adjuvant. In one embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecules and/or mmRNA of the invention may encode an immunogen. The delivery of modified nucleic acid molecules and/or mmRNA encoding an immunogen may activate the immune response. As a non-limiting example, the modified nucleic acid molecules and/or mmRNA encoding an immunogen may be delivered to cells to trigger multiple innate response pathways (see International Pub. No. WO2012006377; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). As another non-limiting example, the modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the present invention encoding an immunogen may be delivered to a vertebrate in a dose amount large enough to be immunogenic to the vertebrate (see International Pub. No. WO2012006372 and WO2012006369; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). The modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of invention may encode a polypeptide sequence for a vaccine and may further comprise an inhibitor.

No. WO2012089225 and WO2012089338; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In one embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the invention may be self-replicating RNA. Self-replicating RNA molecules can enhance efficiency of RNA delivery and expression of the enclosed gene product. In one embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA may comprise at least one modification described herein and/or known in the art. In one embodiment, the self-replicating RNA can be designed so that the self-replicating RNA does not induce production of infectious viral particles. As a non-limiting example the self-replicating RNA may be designed by the methods described in US Pub. No. US20110300205 and International Pub. No. WO2011005799, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In one embodiment, the self-replicating modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the invention may encode a protein which may raise the immune response. As a non-limiting example, the modified nucleic acid molecules and/or mmRNA may be self-replicating mRNA may encode at least one antigen (see US Pub. No. US20110300205 and International Pub. No. WO2011005799; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In one embodiment, the self-replicating modified nucleic acids or mmRNA of the invention may be formulated using methods described herein or known in the art. As a non-limiting example, the self-replicating RNA may be formulated for delivery by the methods described in Geall et al (Nonviral delivery of self-amplifying RNA vaccines, PNAS 2012; PMID: 22908294; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the present invention may encode amphipathic and/or immunogenic amphipathic peptides. In on embodiment, a formulation of the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the present invention may further comprise an amphipathic and/or immunogenic amphipathic peptide. As a non-limiting example, the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA comprising an amphipathic and/or immunogenic amphipathic peptide may be formulated as described in US. Pub. No. US20110250237 and International Pub. Nos. WO2010009277 and WO2010009065; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In one embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the present invention may be immunostimultory. As a non-limiting example, the modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA may encode all or a part of a positive-sense or a negative-sense stranded RNA virus genome (see International Pub No. WO2012092569 and US Pub No. US20120177701, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In another non-limiting example, the immunostimultory modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the present invention may be formulated with an excipient for administration as described herein and/or known in the art (see International Pub No. WO2012068295 and US Pub No. US20120213812, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In one embodiment, the response of the vaccine formulated by the methods described herein may be enhanced by the addition of various compounds to induce the therapeutic effect. As a non-limiting example, the vaccine formulation may include a MHC II binding peptide or a peptide having a similar sequence to a MHC II binding peptide (see International Pub Nos. WO2012027365, WO2011031298 and US Pub No. US20120070493, US20110110965, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). As another example, the vaccine formulations may comprise modified nicotinic compounds which may generate an antibody response to nicotine residue in a subject (see International Pub No. WO2012061717 and US Pub No. US20120114677, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Polypeptide Variants The modified nucleic acid molecules encode polypeptides, e.g., a variant polypeptides, which have a certain identity to a reference polypeptide sequence. The term “identity,” as known in the art, refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more peptides, determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, “identity” also refers to the degree of sequence relatedness between peptides, as determined by the number of matches between strings of two or more amino acid residues. Identity measures the percent of identical matches between the smaller of two or more sequences with gap alignments (if any) addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., “algorithms”). Identity of related peptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part 1, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987; Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York, 1991; and Carillo et al., SIAM J. Applied Math. 48, 1073 (1988); all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In some embodiments, the polypeptide variant may have the same or a similar activity as the reference polypeptide. Alternatively, the variant may have an altered activity (e.g., increased or decreased) relative to a reference polypeptide. Generally, variants of a particular polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present disclosure will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that particular reference polynucleotide or polypeptide as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described herein and known to those skilled in the art. As recognized by those skilled in the art, protein fragments, functional protein domains, and homologous proteins are also considered to be within the scope of this present disclosure. For example, provided herein is any protein fragment of a reference protein (meaning a polypeptide sequence which is at least one amino acid residue shorter than a reference polypeptide sequence but otherwise identical) 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 or greater than 100 amino acids in length. In another example, any protein that includes a stretch of about 20, about 30, about 40, about 50, or about 100 amino acids which are about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100% identical to any of the sequences described herein can be utilized in accordance with the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, a protein sequence to be utilized in accordance with the present disclosure includes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more mutations as shown in any of the sequences provided or referenced herein. Polypeptide-Nucleic Acid Complexes Proper protein translation involves the physical aggregation of a number of polypeptides and nucleic acids associated with the mRNA. Provided by the present disclosure are protein-nucleic acid complexes, containing a translatable mRNA having one or more nucleoside modifications (e.g., at least two different nucleoside modifications) and one or more polypeptides bound to the mRNA. Generally, the proteins are provided in an amount effective to prevent or to reduce an innate immune response of a cell into which the complex is introduced. Untranslatable Modified Nucleic Acid Molecules As described herein, provided are mRNA having sequences that are substantially not translatable. Such mRNA may be effective as a vaccine when administered to a subject. It is further provided that the subject administered the vaccine may be a mammal, more preferably a human and most preferably a patient. Also provided are modified nucleic acid molecules that contain one or more noncoding regions. Such modified nucleic acid molecules are generally not translated, but are capable of binding to and sequestering one or more translational machinery component such as a ribosomal protein or a transfer RNA (tRNA), thereby effectively reducing the protein expression in the cell. The modified nucleic acid molecule may contain a small nucleolar RNA (sno-RNA), micro RNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA) or Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA). Pharmaceutical Compositions Formulation, Administration, Delivery and Dosing The present invention provides modified nucleic acids and mmRNA compositions and complexes in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Pharmaceutical compositions may optionally comprise one or more additional active substances, e.g. therapeutically and/or prophylactically active substances. General considerations in the formulation and/or manufacture of pharmaceutical agents may be found, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In some embodiments, compositions are administered to humans, human patients or subjects. For the purposes of the present disclosure, the phrase “active ingredient” generally refers to modified nucleic acids and mmRNA to be delivered as described herein. Although the descriptions of pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are principally directed to pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for administration to humans, it will be understood by the skilled artisan that such compositions are generally suitable for administration to any other animal, e.g., to non-human animals, e.g. non-human mammals. Modification of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to humans in order to render the compositions suitable for administration to various animals is well understood, and the ordinarily skilled veterinary pharmacologist can design and/or perform such modification with merely ordinary, if any, experimentation. Subjects to which administration of the pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated include, but are not limited to, humans and/or other primates; mammals, including commercially relevant mammals such as cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, cats, dogs, mice, and/or rats; and/or birds, including commercially relevant birds such as poultry, chickens, ducks, geese, and/or turkeys. Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology. In general, such preparatory methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with an excipient and/or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if necessary and/or desirable, dividing, shaping and/or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit. A pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the invention may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in bulk, as a single unit dose, and/or as a plurality of single unit doses. As used herein, a “unit dose” is discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. The amount of the active ingredient is generally equal to the dosage of the active ingredient which would be administered to a subject and/or a convenient fraction of such a dosage such as, for example, one-half or one-third of such a dosage. Relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, and/or any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the invention will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and/or condition of the subject treated and further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. By way of example, the composition may comprise between 0.1% and 100%, e.g., between 0.5 and 50%, between 1-30%, between 5-80%, at least 80% (w/w) active ingredient. Formulations The modified nucleic acid, and mmRNA of the invention can be formulated using one or more excipients to: (1) increase stability; (2) increase cell transfection; (3) permit the sustained or delayed release (e.g., from a depot formulation of the modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA); (4) alter the biodistribution (e.g., target the modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA to specific tissues or cell types); (5) increase the translation of encoded protein in vivo; and/or (6) alter the release profile of encoded protein in vivo. In addition to traditional excipients such as any and all solvents, dispersion media, diluents, or other liquid vehicles, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, excipients of the present invention can include, without limitation, lipidoids, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, polymers, lipoplexes, core-shell nanoparticles, peptides, proteins, cells transfected with modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA (e.g., for transplantation into a subject), hyaluronidase, nanoparticle mimics and combinations thereof. Accordingly, the formulations of the invention can include one or more excipients, each in an amount that together increases the stability of the modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA, increases cell transfection by the modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA, increases the expression of modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA encoded protein, and/or alters the release profile of modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA encoded proteins. Further, the modified nucleic acids and mmRNA of the present invention may be formulated using self-assembled nucleic acid nanoparticles. Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology. In general, such preparatory methods include the step of associating the active ingredient with an excipient and/or one or more other accessory ingredients. A pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the present disclosure may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in bulk, as a single unit dose, and/or as a plurality of single unit doses. As used herein, a “unit dose” refers to a discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. The amount of the active ingredient may generally be equal to the dosage of the active ingredient which would be administered to a subject and/or a convenient fraction of such a dosage including, but not limited to, one-half or one-third of such a dosage. Relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, and/or any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the present disclosure may vary, depending upon the identity, size, and/or condition of the subject being treated and further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. For example, the composition may comprise between 0.1% and 99% (w/w) of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, the modified mRNA formulations described herein may contain at least one modified mRNA. The formulations may contain 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 modified mRNA. In one embodiment, the formulation contains at least three modified mRNA encoding proteins. In one embodiment, the formulation contains at least five modified mRNA encoding proteins. Pharmaceutical formulations may additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, which, as used herein, includes, but is not limited to, any and all solvents, dispersion media, diluents, or other liquid vehicles, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Various excipients for formulating pharmaceutical compositions and techniques for preparing the composition are known in the art (see Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition, A. R. Gennaro, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md., 2006; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The use of a conventional excipient medium may be contemplated within the scope of the present disclosure, except insofar as any conventional excipient medium may be incompatible with a substance or its derivatives, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments, the particle size of the lipid nanoparticle may be increased and/or decreased. The change in particle size may be able to help counter biological reaction such as, but not limited to, inflammation or may increase the biological effect of the modified mRNA delivered to mammals. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, surface active agents and/or emulsifiers, preservatives, buffering agents, lubricating agents, and/or oils. Such excipients may optionally be included in the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention. Lipidoids The synthesis of lipidoids has been extensively described and formulations containing these compounds are particularly suited for delivery of modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA (see Mahon et al., Bioconjug Chem. 2010 21:1448-1454; Schroeder et al., J Intern Med. 2010 267:9-21; Akinc et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2008 26:561-569; Love et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 107:1864-1869; Siegwart et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2011 108:12996-3001; all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties). While these lipidoids have been used to effectively deliver double stranded small interfering RNA molecules in rodents and non-human primates (see Akinc et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2008 26:561-569; Frank-Kamenetsky et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2008 105:11915-11920; Akinc et al., Mol. Ther. 2009 17:872-879; Love et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 107:1864-1869; Leuschner et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2011 29:1005-1010; all of which is incorporated herein in their entirety), the present disclosure describes their formulation and use in delivering single stranded modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA. Complexes, micelles, liposomes or particles can be prepared containing these lipidoids and therefore, can result in an effective delivery of the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA, as judged by the production of an encoded protein, following the injection of a lipidoid formulation via localized and/or systemic routes of administration. Lipidoid complexes of modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA can be administered by various means including, but not limited to, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. In vivo delivery of nucleic acids may be affected by many parameters, including, but not limited to, the formulation composition, nature of particle PEGylation, degree of loading, oligonucleotide to lipid ratio, and biophysical parameters such as, but not limited to, particle size (Akinc et al., Mol Ther. 2009 17:872-879; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). As an example, small changes in the anchor chain length of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids may result in significant effects on in vivo efficacy. Formulations with the different lipidoids, including, but not limited to penta[3-(1-laurylaminopropionyl)]-triethylenetetramine hydrochloride (TETA-5LAP; aka 98N12-5, see Murugaiah et al., Analytical Biochemistry, 401:61 (2010); herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), C12-200 (including derivatives and variants), and MD1, can be tested for in vivo activity. The lipidoid referred to herein as “98N12-5” is disclosed by Akinc et al., Mol Ther. 2009 17:872-879 and is incorporated by reference in its entirety (See FIG. 1). The lipidoid referred to herein as “C12-200” is disclosed by Love et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 107:1864-1869 and Liu and Huang, Molecular Therapy. 2010 669-670 (see FIG. 1); both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The lipidoid formulations can include particles comprising either 3 or 4 or more components in addition to modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA. As an example, formulations with certain lipidoids, include, but are not limited to, 98N12-5 and may contain 42% lipidoid, 48% cholesterol and 10% PEG (C14 alkyl chain length). As another example, formulations with certain lipidoids, include, but are not limited to, C12-200 and may contain 50% lipidoid, 10% disteroylphosphatidyl choline, 38.5% cholesterol, and 1.5% PEG-DMG. In one embodiment, a modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA formulated with a lipidoid for systemic intravenous administration can target the liver. For example, a final optimized intravenous formulation using modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA, and comprising a lipid molar composition of 42% 98N12-5, 48% cholesterol, and 10% PEG-lipid with a final weight ratio of about 7.5 to 1 total lipid to modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA, and a C14 alkyl chain length on the PEG lipid, with a mean particle size of roughly 50-60 nm, can result in the distribution of the formulation to be greater than 90% to the liver. (see, Akinc et al., Mol Ther. 2009 17:872-879; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another example, an intravenous formulation using a C12-200 (see U.S. provisional application 61/175,770 and published international application WO2010129709, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety) lipidoid may have a molar ratio of 50/10/38.5/1.5 of C12-200/disteroylphosphatidyl choline/cholesterol/PEG-DMG, with a weight ratio of 7 to 1 total lipid to modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA, and a mean particle size of 80 nm may be effective to deliver modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA to hepatocytes (see, Love et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 107:1864-1869 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, an MD1 lipidoid-containing formulation may be used to effectively deliver modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA to hepatocytes in vivo. The characteristics of optimized lipidoid formulations for intramuscular or subcutaneous routes may vary significantly depending on the target cell type and the ability of formulations to diffuse through the extracellular matrix into the blood stream. While a particle size of less than 150 nm may be desired for effective hepatocyte delivery due to the size of the endothelial fenestrae (see, Akinc et al., Mol Ther. 2009 17:872-879 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), use of a lipidoid-formulated modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA to deliver the formulation to other cells types including, but not limited to, endothelial cells, myeloid cells, and muscle cells may not be similarly size-limited. Use of lipidoid formulations to deliver siRNA in vivo to other non-hepatocyte cells such as myeloid cells and endothelium has been reported (see Akinc et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2008 26:561-569; Leuschner et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2011 29:1005-1010; Cho et al. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2009 19:3112-3118; 8th International Judah Folkman Conference, Cambridge, Mass. Oct. 8-9, 2010; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Effective delivery to myeloid cells, such as monocytes, lipidoid formulations may have a similar component molar ratio. Different ratios of lipidoids and other components including, but not limited to, disteroylphosphatidyl choline, cholesterol and PEG-DMG, may be used to optimize the formulation of the modified nucleic acid, or mmRNA for delivery to different cell types including, but not limited to, hepatocytes, myeloid cells, muscle cells, etc. For example, the component molar ratio may include, but is not limited to, 50% C12-200, 10% disteroylphosphatidyl choline, 38.5% cholesterol, and %1.5 PEG-DMG (see Leuschner et al., Nat Biotechnol 2011 29:1005-1010; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The use of lipidoid formulations for the localized delivery of nucleic acids to cells (such as, but not limited to, adipose cells and muscle cells) via either subcutaneous or intramuscular delivery, may not require all of the formulation components desired for systemic delivery, and as such may comprise only the lipidoid and the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA. Combinations of different lipidoids may be used to improve the efficacy of modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA directed protein production as the lipidoids may be able to increase cell transfection by the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA; and/or increase the translation of encoded protein (see Whitehead et al., Mol. Ther. 2011, 19:1688-1694, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Liposomes, Lipoplexes, and Lipid Nanoparticles The modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the invention can be formulated using one or more liposomes, lipoplexes, or lipid nanoparticles. In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions of modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA include liposomes. Liposomes are artificially-prepared vesicles which may primarily be composed of a lipid bilayer and may be used as a delivery vehicle for the administration of nutrients and pharmaceutical formulations. Liposomes can be of different sizes such as, but not limited to, a multilamellar vesicle (MLV) which may be hundreds of nanometers in diameter and may contain a series of concentric bilayers separated by narrow aqueous compartments, a small unicellular vesicle (SUV) which may be smaller than 50 nm in diameter, and a large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) which may be between 50 and 500 nm in diameter. Liposome design may include, but is not limited to, opsonins or ligands in order to improve the attachment of liposomes to unhealthy tissue or to activate events such as, but not limited to, endocytosis. Liposomes may contain a low or a high pH in order to improve the delivery of the pharmaceutical formulations. The formation of liposomes may depend on the physicochemical characteristics such as, but not limited to, the pharmaceutical formulation entrapped and the liposomal ingredients, the nature of the medium in which the lipid vesicles are dispersed, the effective concentration of the entrapped substance and its potential toxicity, any additional processes involved during the application and/or delivery of the vesicles, the optimization size, polydispersity and the shelf-life of the vesicles for the intended application, and the batch-to-batch reproducibility and possibility of large-scale production of safe and efficient liposomal products. In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions described herein may include, without limitation, liposomes such as those formed from 1,2-dioleyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DODMA) liposomes, DiLa2 liposomes from Marina Biotech (Bothell, Wash.), 1,2-dilinoleyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLin-DMA), 2,2-dilinoleyl-4-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLin-KC2-DMA), and MC3 (US20100324120; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) and liposomes which may deliver small molecule drugs such as, but not limited to, DOXIL® from Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Horsham, Pa.). In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions described herein may include, without limitation, liposomes such as those formed from the synthesis of stabilized plasmid-lipid particles (SPLP) or stabilized nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP) that have been previously described and shown to be suitable for oligonucleotide delivery in vitro and in vivo (see Wheeler et al. Gene Therapy. 1999 6:271-281; Zhang et al. Gene Therapy. 1999 6:1438-1447; Jeffs et al. Pharm Res. 2005 22:362-372; Morrissey et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2005 2:1002-1007; Zimmermann et al., Nature. 2006 441:111-114; Heyes et al. J Contr Rel. 2005 107:276-287; Semple et al. Nature Biotech. 2010 28:172-176; Judge et al. J Clin Invest. 2009 119:661-673; deFougerolles Hum Gene Ther. 2008 19:125-132; all of which are incorporated herein in their entireties.) The original manufacture method by Wheeler et al. was a detergent dialysis method, which was later improved by Jeffs et al. and is referred to as the spontaneous vesicle formation method. The liposome formulations are composed of 3 to 4 lipid components in addition to the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA. As an example a liposome can contain, but is not limited to, 55% cholesterol, 20% disteroylphosphatidyl choline (DSPC), 10% PEG-S-DSG, and 15% 1,2-dioleyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DODMA), as described by Jeffs et al. As another example, certain liposome formulations may contain, but are not limited to, 48% cholesterol, 20% DSPC, 2% PEG-c-DMA, and 30% cationic lipid, where the cationic lipid can be 1,2-distearloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DSDMA), DODMA, DLin-DMA, or 1,2-dilinolenyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLenDMA), as described by Heyes et al. In one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions may include liposomes which may be formed to deliver mmRNA which may encode at least one immunogen. The mmRNA may be encapsulated by the liposome and/or it may be contained in an aqueous core which may then be encapsulated by the liposome (see International Pub. Nos. WO2012031046, WO2012031043, WO2012030901 and WO2012006378; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In another embodiment, the mmRNA which may encode an immunogen may be formulated in a cationic oil-in-water emulsion where the emulsion particle comprises an oil core and a cationic lipid which can interact with the mmRNA anchoring the molecule to the emulsion particle (see International Pub. No. WO2012006380; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In yet another embodiment, the lipid formulation may include at least cationic lipid, a lipid which may enhance transfection and a least one lipid which contains a hydrophilic head group linked to a lipid moiety (International Pub. No. WO2011076807 and U.S. Pub. No. 20110200582; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). In another embodiment, the modified mRNA encoding an immunogen may be formulated in a lipid vesicle which may have crosslinks between functionalized lipid bilayers (see U.S. Pub. No. 20120177724, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, the modified mRNA may be formulated in a lipid vesicle which may have crosslinks between functionalized lipid bilayers. In one embodiment, the modified mRNA may be formulated in a lipid-polycation complex. The formation of the lipid-polycation complex may be accomplished by methods known in the art and/or as described in U.S. Pub. No. 20120178702, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. As a non-limiting example, the polycation may include a cationic peptide or a polypeptide such as, but not limited to, polylysine, polyornithine and/or polyarginine and the cationic peptides described in International Pub. No. WO2012013326; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another embodiment, the modified mRNA may be formulated in a lipid-polycation complex which may further include a neutral lipid such as, but not limited to, cholesterol or dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). The liposome formulation may be influenced by, but not limited to, the selection of the cationic lipid component, the degree of cationic lipid saturation, the nature of the PEGylation, ratio of all components and biophysical parameters such as size. In one example by Semple et al. (Semple et al. Nature Biotech. 2010 28:172-176; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), the liposome formulation was composed of 57.1% cationic lipid, 7.1% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 34.3% cholesterol, and 1.4% PEG-c-DMA. As another example, changing the composition of the cationic lipid could more effectively deliver siRNA to various antigen presenting cells (Basha et al. Mol. Ther. 2011 19:2186-2200; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In some embodiments, the ratio of PEG in the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations may be increased or decreased and/or the carbon chain length of the PEG lipid may be modified from C14 to C18 to alter the pharmacokinetics and/or biodistribution of the LNP formulations. As a non-limiting example, LNP formulations may contain 1-5% of the lipid molar ratio of PEG-c-DOMG as compared to the cationic lipid, DSPC and cholesterol. In another embodiment the PEG-c-DOMG may be replaced with a PEG lipid such as, but not limited to, PEG-DSG (1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycerol, methoxypolyethylene glycol) or PEG-DPG (1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol, methoxypolyethylene glycol). The cationic lipid may be selected from any lipid known in the art such as, but not limited to, DLin-MC3-DMA, DLin-DMA, C12-200 and DLin-KC2-DMA. In one embodiment, the cationic lipid may be selected from, but not limited to, a cationic lipid described in International Publication Nos.

In another embodiment, the cationic lipid may be selected from, but not limited to, formula A described in International Publication Nos. WO2012040184, WO2011153120, WO2011149733, WO2011090965, WO2011043913, WO2011022460, WO2012061259, WO2012054365 and WO2012044638; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In yet another embodiment, the cationic lipid may be selected from, but not limited to, formula CLI-CLXXIX of International Publication No. WO2008103276, formula CLI-CLXXIX of U.S. Pat. No. 7,893,302, formula CLI-CLXXXXII of U.S. Pat. No. 7,404,969 and formula I-VI of US Patent Publication No. US20100036115; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In one embodiment, the LNP formulation may contain PEG-c-DOMG at 3% lipid molar ratio. In another embodiment, the LNP formulation may contain PEG-c-DOMG at 1.5% lipid molar ratio. In one embodiment, the LNP formulation may contain PEG-DMG 2000 (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phophoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000). In one embodiment, the LNP formulation may contain PEG-DMG 2000, a cationic lipid known in the art and at least one other component. In another embodiment, the LNP formulation may contain PEG-DMG 2000, a cationic lipid known in the art, DSPC and cholesterol. As a non-limiting example, the LNP formulation may contain PEG-DMG 2000, DLin-DMA, DSPC and cholesterol. As another non-limiting example the LNP formulation may contain PEG-DMG 2000, DLin-DMA, DSPC and cholesterol in a molar ratio of 2:40:10:48 (see e.g. Geall et al., Nonviral delivery of self-amplifying RNA vaccines, PNAS 2012; PMID: 22908294; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, the LNP formulation may be formulated by the methods described in International Publication Nos. WO2011127255 or WO2008103276, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. As a non-limiting example, modified RNA described herein may be encapsulated in LNP formulations as described in WO2011127255 and/or WO2008103276; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. As another non-limiting example, modified RNA described herein may be formulated in a nanoparticle to be delivered by a parenteral route as described in U.S. Pub. No. 20120207845; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, LNP formulations described herein may comprise a polycationic composition. As a non-limiting example, the polycationic composition may be selected from formula I-60 of US Patent Publication No. US20050222064; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another embodiment, the LNP formulations comprising a polycationic composition may be used for the delivery of the modified RNA described herein in vivo and/or in vitro. In one embodiment, the LNP formulations described herein may additionally comprise a permeability enhancer molecule. Non-limiting permeability enhancer molecules are described in US Patent Publication No. US20050222064; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in liposomes such as, but not limited to, DiLa2 liposomes (Marina Biotech, Bothell, Wash.), SMARTICLES® (Marina Biotech, Bothell, Wash.), neutral DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) based liposomes (e.g., siRNA delivery for ovarian cancer (Landen et al. Cancer Biology & Therapy 2006 5(12)1708-1713); herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) and hyaluronan-coated liposomes (Quiet Therapeutics, Israel). The nanoparticle formulations may be a carbohydrate nanoparticle comprising a carbohydrate carrier and a modified nucleic acid molecule (e.g., mmRNA). As a non-limiting example, the carbohydrate carrier may include, but is not limited to, an anhydride-modified phytoglycogen or glycogen-type material, phytoglycogen octenyl succinate, phytoglycogen beta-dextrin, anhydride-modified phytoglycogen beta-dextrin. (See e.g., International Publication No. WO2012109121; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Lipid nanoparticle formulations may be improved by replacing the cationic lipid with a biodegradable cationic lipid which is known as a rapidly eliminated lipid nanoparticle (reLNP). Ionizable cationic lipids, such as, but not limited to, DLinDMA, DLin-KC2-DMA, and DLin-MC3-DMA, have been shown to accumulate in plasma and tissues over time and may be a potential source of toxicity. The rapid metabolism of the rapidly eliminated lipids can improve the tolerability and therapeutic index of the lipid nanoparticles by an order of magnitude from a 1 mg/kg dose to a 10 mg/kg dose in rat. Inclusion of an enzymatically degraded ester linkage can improve the degradation and metabolism profile of the cationic component, while still maintaining the activity of the reLNP formulation. The ester linkage can be internally located within the lipid chain or it may be terminally located at the terminal end of the lipid chain. The internal ester linkage may replace any carbon in the lipid chain. In one embodiment, the internal ester linkage may be located on either side of the saturated carbon. Non-limiting examples of reLNPs include, In one embodiment, an immune response may be elicited by delivering a lipid nanoparticle which may include a nanospecies, a polymer and an immunogen. (U.S. Publication No. 20120189700 and International Publication No. WO2012099805; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). The polymer may encapsulate the nanospecies or partially encapsulate the nanospecies. The immunogen may be a recombinant protein, a modified RNA described herein. In one embodiment, the lipid nanoparticle may be formulated for use in a vaccine such as, but not limited to, against a pathogen. Lipid nanoparticles may be engineered to alter the surface properties of particles so the lipid nanoparticles may penetrate the mucosal barrier. Mucus is located on mucosal tissue such as, but not limited to, oral (e.g., the buccal and esophageal membranes and tonsil tissue), ophthalmic, gastrointestinal (e.g., stomach, small intestine, large intestine, colon, rectum), nasal, respiratory (e.g., nasal, pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial membranes), genital (e.g., vaginal, cervical and urethral membranes). Nanoparticles larger than 10-200 nm which are preferred for higher drug encapsulation efficiency and the ability to provide the sustained delivery of a wide array of drugs have been thought to be too large to rapidly diffuse through mucosal barriers. Mucus is continuously secreted, shed, discarded or digested and recycled so most of the trapped particles may be removed from the mucosla tissue within seconds or within a few hours. Large polymeric nanoparticles (200 nm-500 nm in diameter) which have been coated densely with a low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) diffused through mucus only 4 to 6-fold lower than the same particles diffusing in water (Lai et al. PNAS 2007 104(5):1482-487; Lai et al. Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2009 61(2): 158-171; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). The transport of nanoparticles may be determined using rates of permeation and/or fluorescent microscopy techniques including, but not limited to, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and high resolution multiple particle tracking (MPT). As a non-limiting example, compositions which can penetrate a mucosal barrier may be made as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,241,670, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The lipid nanoparticle engineered to penetrate mucus may comprise a polymeric material (i.e. a polymeric core) and/or a polymer-vitamin conjugate and/or a tri-block co-polymer. The polymeric material may include, but is not limited to, polyamines, polyethers, polyamides, polyesters, polycarbamates, polyureas, polycarbonates, poly(styrenes), polyimides, polysulfones, polyurethanes, polyacetylenes, polyethylenes, polyethyeneimines, polyisocyanates, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyacrylonitriles, and polyarylates. The polymeric material may be biodegradable and/or biocompatible. The polymeric material may additionally be irradiated. As a non-limiting example, the polymeric material may be gamma irradiated (See e.g., International App. No. WO201282165, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Non-limiting examples of specific polymers include poly(caprolactone) (PCL), ethylene vinyl acetate polymer (EVA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLLGA), poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLA), poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), poly(D,L-lactide-co-caprolactone), poly(D,L-lactide-co-caprolactone-co-glycolide), poly(D,L-lactide-co-PEO-co-D,L-lactide), poly(D,L-lactide-co-PPO-co-D,L-lactide), polyalkyl cyanoacralate, polyurethane, poly-L-lysine (PLL), hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA), polyethyleneglycol, poly-L-glutamic acid, poly(hydroxy acids), polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, poly(ester amides), polyamides, poly(ester ethers), polycarbonates, polyalkylenes such as polyethylene and polypropylene, polyalkylene glycols such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), polyalkylene oxides (PEO), polyalkylene terephthalates such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyvinyl alcohols (PVA), polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters such as poly(vinyl acetate), polyvinyl halides such as poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), polyvinylpyrrolidone, polysiloxanes, polystyrene (PS), polyurethanes, derivatized celluloses such as alkyl celluloses, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, nitro celluloses, hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, polymers of acrylic acids, such as poly(methyl(meth)acrylate) (PMMA), poly(ethyl(meth)acrylate), poly(butyl(meth)acrylate), poly(isobutyl(meth)acrylate), poly(hexyl(meth)acrylate), poly(isodecyl(meth)acrylate), poly(lauryl(meth)acrylate), poly(phenyl(meth)acrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), poly(octadecyl acrylate) and copolymers and mixtures thereof, polydioxanone and its copolymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates, polypropylene fumarate, polyoxymethylene, poloxamers, poly(ortho)esters, poly(butyric acid), poly(valeric acid), poly(lactide-co-caprolactone), and trimethylene carbonate, polyvinylpyrrolidone. The lipid nanoparticle may be coated or associated with a co-polymer such as, but not limited to, a block co-polymer, and (poly(ethylene glycol))-(poly(propylene oxide))-(poly(ethylene glycol)) triblock copolymer (see e.g., US Publication 20120121718 and US Publication 20100003337 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,263,665; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). The co-polymer may be a polymer that is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) and the formation of the lipid nanoparticle may be in such a way that no new chemical entities are created. For example, the lipid nanoparticle may comprise poloxamers coating PLGA nanoparticles without forming new chemical entities which are still able to rapidly penetrate human mucus (Yang et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011 50:2597-2600; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The vitamin of the polymer-vitamin conjugate may be vitamin E. The vitamin portion of the conjugate may be substituted with other suitable components such as, but not limited to, vitamin A, vitamin E, other vitamins, cholesterol, a hydrophobic moiety, or a hydrophobic component of other surfactants (e.g., sterol chains, fatty acids, hydrocarbon chains and alkylene oxide chains). The lipid nanoparticle engineered to penetrate mucus may include surface altering agents such as, but not limited to, mmRNA, anionic proteins (e.g., bovine serum albumin), surfactants (e.g., cationic surfactants such as for example dimethyldioctadecyl-ammonium bromide), sugars or sugar derivatives (e.g., cyclodextrin), nucleic acids, polymers (e.g., heparin, polyethylene glycol and poloxamer), mucolytic agents (e.g., N-acetylcysteine, mugwort, bromelain, papain, clerodendrum, acetylcysteine, bromhexine, carbocisteine, eprazinone, mesna, ambroxol, sobrerol, domiodol, letosteine, stepronin, tiopronin, gelsolin, thymosin β4 dornase alfa, neltenexine, erdosteine) and various DNases including rhDNase. The surface altering agent may be embedded or enmeshed in the particle's surface or disposed (e.g., by coating, adsorption, covalent linkage, or other process) on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle. (see e.g., US Publication 20100215580 and US Publication 20080166414; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). The mucus penetrating lipid nanoparticles may comprise at least one mmRNA described herein. The mmRNA may be encapsulated in the lipid nanoparticle and/or disposed on the surface of the particle. The mmRNA may be covalently coupled to the lipid nanoparticle. Formulations of mucus penetrating lipid nanoparticles may comprise a plurality of nanoparticles. Further, the formulations may contain particles which may interact with the mucus and alter the structural and/or adhesive properties of the surrounding mucus to decrease mucoadhesion which may increase the delivery of the mucus penetrating lipid nanoparticles to the mucosal tissue. In one embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA is formulated as a lipoplex, such as, without limitation, the ATUPLEX™ system, the DACC system, the DBTC system and other siRNA-lipoplex technology from Silence Therapeutics (London, United Kingdom), STEMFECT™ from STEMGENT® (Cambridge, Mass.), and polyethylenimine (PEI) or protamine-based targeted and non-targeted delivery of nucleic acids (Aleku et al.

Polymers, Biodegradable Nanoparticles, and Core-Shell Nanoparticles The modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the invention can be formulated using natural and/or synthetic polymers. Non-limiting examples of polymers which may be used for delivery include, but are not limited to, DYNAMIC POLYCONJUGATE® (Arrowhead Research Corp., Pasadena, Calif.) formulations from MIRUS® Bio (Madison, Wis.) and Roche Madison (Madison, Wis.), PHASERX™ polymer formulations such as, without limitation, SMARTT POLYMER TECHNOLOGYT™ (Seattle, Wash.), DMRI/DOPE, poloxamer, VAXFECTIN® adjuvant from Vical (San Diego, Calif.), chitosan, cyclodextrin from Calando Pharmaceuticals (Pasadena, Calif.), dendrimers and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymers, RONDEL™ (RNAi/Oligonucleotide Nanoparticle Delivery) polymers (Arrowhead Research Corporation, Pasadena, Calif.) and pH responsive co-block polymers such as, but not limited to, PHASERX™ (Seattle, Wash.). A non-limiting example of chitosan formulation includes a core of positively charged chitosan and an outer portion of negatively charged substrate (U.S. Pub. No. 20120258176; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Chitosan includes, but is not limited to N-trimethyl chitosan, mono-N-carboxymethyl chitosan (MCC), N-palmitoyl chitosan (NPCS), EDTA-chitosan, low molecular weight chitosan, chitosan derivatives, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the polymers used in the present invention have undergone processing to reduce and/or inhibit the attachment of unwanted substances such as, but not limited to, bacteria, to the surface of the polymer. The polymer may be processed by methods known and/or described in the art and/or described in International Pub. No. WO2012150467, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. A non-limiting example of PLGA formulations include, but are not limited to, PLGA injectable depots (e.g., ELIGARD® which is formed by dissolving PLGA in 66% N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and the remainder being aqueous solvent and leuprolide. Once injected, the PLGA and leuprolide peptide precipitates into the subcutaneous space). Many of these polymer approaches have demonstrated efficacy in delivering oligonucleotides in vivo into the cell cytoplasm (reviewed in deFougerolles Hum Gene Ther. 2008 19:125-132; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Two polymer approaches that have yielded robust in vivo delivery of nucleic acids, in this case with small interfering RNA (siRNA), are dynamic polyconjugates and cyclodextrin-based nanoparticles. The first of these delivery approaches uses dynamic polyconjugates and has been shown in vivo in mice to effectively deliver siRNA and silence endogenous target mRNA in hepatocytes (Rozema et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2007 104:12982-12887; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). This particular approach is a multicomponent polymer system whose key features include a membrane-active polymer to which nucleic acid, in this case siRNA, is covalently coupled via a disulfide bond and where both PEG (for charge masking) and N-acetylgalactosamine (for hepatocyte targeting) groups are linked via pH-sensitive bonds (Rozema et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2007 104:12982-12887; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). On binding to the hepatocyte and entry into the endosome, the polymer complex disassembles in the low-pH environment, with the polymer exposing its positive charge, leading to endosomal escape and cytoplasmic release of the siRNA from the polymer. Through replacement of the N-acetylgalactosamine group with a mannose group, it was shown one could alter targeting from asialoglycoprotein receptor-expressing hepatocytes to sinusoidal endothelium and Kupffer cells. Another polymer approach involves using transferrin-targeted cyclodextrin-containing polycation nanoparticles. These nanoparticles have demonstrated targeted silencing of the EWS-FLI1 gene product in transferrin receptor-expressing Ewing's sarcoma tumor cells (Hu-Lieskovan et al., Cancer Res. 2005 65: 8984-8982; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) and siRNA formulated in these nanoparticles was well tolerated in non-human primates (Heidel et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2007 104:5715-21; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Both of these delivery strategies incorporate rational approaches using both targeted delivery and endosomal escape mechanisms. The polymer formulation can permit the sustained or delayed release of modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA (e.g., following intramuscular or subcutaneous injection). The altered release profile for the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA can result in, for example, translation of an encoded protein over an extended period of time. The polymer formulation may also be used to increase the stability of the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA. Biodegradable polymers have been previously used to protect nucleic acids other than mmRNA from degradation and been shown to result in sustained release of payloads in vivo (Rozema et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2007 104:12982-12887; Sullivan et al., Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2010 7:1433-1446; Convertine et al., Biomacromolecules. 2010 Oct. 1; Chu et al., Acc Chem. Res. 2012 Jan. 13; Manganiello et al., Biomaterials. 2012 33:2301-2309; Benoit et al., Biomacromolecules. 2011 12:2708-2714; Singha et al., Nucleic Acid Ther. 2011 2:133-147; deFougerolles Hum Gene Ther. 2008 19:125-132; Schaffert and Wagner, Gene Ther. 2008 16:1131-1138; Chaturvedi et al., Expert Opin Drug Deliv. 2011 8:1455-1468; Davis, Mol. Pharm. 2009 6:659-668; Davis, Nature 2010 464:1067-1070; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions may be sustained release formulations. In a further embodiment, the sustained release formulations may be for subcutaneous delivery. Sustained release formulations may include, but are not limited to, PLGA microspheres, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVAc), poloxamer, GELSITE® (Nanotherapeutics, Inc. Alachua, Fla.), HYLENEX® (Halozyme Therapeutics, San Diego Calif.), surgical sealants such as fibrinogen polymers (Ethicon Inc. Cornelia, Ga.), TISSELL® (Baxter International, Inc Deerfield, Ill.), PEG-based sealants, and COSEAL® (Baxter International, Inc Deerfield, Ill.). As a non-limiting example modified mRNA may be formulated in PLGA microspheres by preparing the PLGA microspheres with tunable release rates (e.g., days and weeks) and encapsulating the modified mRNA in the PLGA microspheres while maintaining the integrity of the modified mRNA during the encapsulation process. EVAc are non-biodegradeable, biocompatible polymers which are used extensively in pre-clinical sustained release implant applications (e.g., extended release products Ocusert a pilocarpine ophthalmic insert for glaucoma or progestasert a sustained release progesterone intrauterine device; transdermal delivery systems Testoderm, Duragesic and Selegiline; catheters). Poloxamer F-407 NF is a hydrophilic, non-ionic surfactant triblock copolymer of polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene having a low viscosity at temperatures less than 5° C. and forms a solid gel at temperatures greater than 15° C. PEG-based surgical sealants comprise two synthetic PEG components mixed in a delivery device which can be prepared in one minute, seals in 3 minutes and is reabsorbed within 30 days. GELSITE® and natural polymers are capable of in-situ gelation at the site of administration.

The cationic polymer may comprise a poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) such as linear PEI. The modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the invention can also be formulated as a nanoparticle using a combination of polymers, lipids, and/or other biodegradable agents, such as, but not limited to, calcium phosphate. Components may be combined in a core-shell, hybrid, and/or layer-by-layer architecture, to allow for fine-tuning of the nanoparticle so to delivery of the modified nucleic acid molecule and mmRNA may be enhanced (Wang et al., Nat Mater. 2006 5:791-796; Fuller et al., Biomaterials. 2008 29:1526-1532; DeKoker et al., Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2011 63:748-761; Endres et al., Biomaterials. 2011 32:7721-7731; Su et al., Mol Pharm. 2011 Jun. 6; 8(3):774-87; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

Biodegradable calcium phosphate nanoparticles in combination with lipids and/or polymers have been shown to deliver modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA in vivo. In one embodiment, a lipid coated calcium phosphate nanoparticle, which may also contain a targeting ligand such as anisamide, may be used to deliver the modified nucleic acid molecule and mmRNA of the present invention. For example, to effectively deliver siRNA in a mouse metastatic lung model a lipid coated calcium phosphate nanoparticle was used (Li et al., J Contr Rel. 2010 142: 416-421; Li et al., J Contr Rel. 2012 158:108-114; Yang et al., Mol Ther. 2012 20:609-615; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

In one embodiment, calcium phosphate with a PEG-polyanion block copolymer may be used to deliver modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA (Kazikawa et al., J Contr Rel. 2004 97:345-356; Kazikawa et al., J Contr Rel. 2006 111:368-370; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In one embodiment, a PEG-charge-conversional polymer (Pitella et al., Biomaterials. 2011 32:3106-3114) may be used to form a nanoparticle to deliver the modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the present invention. The PEG-charge-conversional polymer may improve upon the PEG-polyanion block copolymers by being cleaved into a polycation at acidic pH, thus enhancing endosomal escape. The use of core-shell nanoparticles has additionally focused on a high-throughput approach to synthesize cationic cross-linked nanogel cores and various shells (Siegwart et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2011 108:12996-13001). The complexation, delivery, and internalization of the polymeric nanoparticles can be precisely controlled by altering the chemical composition in both the core and shell components of the nanoparticle. For example, the core-shell nanoparticles may efficiently deliver siRNA to mouse hepatocytes after they covalently attach cholesterol to the nanoparticle. In one embodiment, a hollow lipid core comprising a middle PLGA layer and an outer neutral lipid layer containing PEG may be used to delivery of the modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the present invention. As a non-limiting example, in mice bearing a luciferase-expressing tumor, it was determined that the lipid-polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticle significantly suppressed luciferase expression, as compared to a conventional lipoplex (Shi et al, Angew Chem Int Ed. 2011 50:7027-7031; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

Des. 11(28):3597-611 (2003); and Deshayes et al., Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 62(16):1839-49 (2005), all of which are incorporated herein by reference). The compositions can also be formulated to include a cell penetrating agent, e.g., liposomes, which enhance delivery of the compositions to the intracellular space. Modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the invention may be complexed to peptides and/or proteins such as, but not limited to, peptides and/or proteins from Aileron Therapeutics (Cambridge, Mass.) and Permeon Biologics (Cambridge, Mass.) in order to enable intracellular delivery (Cronican et al., ACS Chem.

In one embodiment, the cell-penetrating polypeptide may comprise a first domain and a second domain. The first domain may comprise a supercharged polypeptide. The second domain may comprise a protein-binding partner. As used herein, “protein-binding partner” includes, but are not limited to, antibodies and functional fragments thereof, scaffold proteins, or peptides. The cell-penetrating polypeptide may further comprise an intracellular binding partner for the protein-binding partner. The cell-penetrating polypeptide may be capable of being secreted from a cell where the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA may be introduced. Formulations of the including peptides or proteins may be used to increase cell transfection by the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA, alter the biodistribution of the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA (e.g., by targeting specific tissues or cell types), and/or increase the translation of encoded protein. (See e.g., International Pub. No. WO2012110636; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).

Delivery The present disclosure encompasses the delivery of modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA for any of therapeutic, pharmaceutical, diagnostic or imaging by any appropriate route taking into consideration likely advances in the sciences of drug delivery. Delivery may be naked or formulated. Naked Delivery The modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the present invention may be delivered to a cell naked. As used herein in, “naked” refers to delivering modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA free from agents which promote transfection. For example, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA delivered to the cell may contain no modifications. The naked modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA may be delivered to the cell using routes of administration known in the art and described herein. Formulated Delivery The modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the present invention may be formulated, using the methods described herein. The formulations may contain modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA which may be modified and/or unmodified. The formulations may further include, but are not limited to, cell penetration agents, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a delivery agent, a bioerodible or biocompatible polymer, a solvent, and a sustained-release delivery depot. The formulated modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA may be delivered to the cell using routes of administration known in the art and described herein. The compositions may also be formulated for direct delivery to an organ or tissue in any of several ways in the art including, but not limited to, direct soaking or bathing, via a catheter, by gels, powder, ointments, creams, gels, lotions, and/or drops, by using substrates such as fabric or biodegradable materials coated or impregnated with the compositions, and the like. Administration The modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the present invention may be administered by any route which results in a therapeutically effective outcome. These include, but are not limited to enteral, gastroenteral, epidural, oral, transdermal, epidural (peridural), intracerebral (into the cerebrum), intracerebroventricular (into the cerebral ventricles), epicutaneous (application onto the skin), intradermal, (into the skin itself), subcutaneous (under the skin), nasal administration (through the nose), intravenous (into a vein), intraarterial (into an artery), intramuscular (into a muscle), intracardiac (into the heart), intraosseous infusion (into the bone marrow), intrathecal (into the spinal canal), intraperitoneal, (infusion or injection into the peritoneum), intravesical infusion, intravitreal, (through the eye), intracavernous injection, (into the base of the penis), intravaginal administration, intrauterine, extra-amniotic administration, transdermal (diffusion through the intact skin for systemic distribution), transmucosal (diffusion through a mucous membrane), insufflation (snorting), sublingual, sublabial, enema, eye drops (onto the conjunctiva), or in ear drops. In specific embodiments, compositions may be administered in a way which allows them cross the blood-brain barrier, vascular barrier, or other epithelial barrier. Non-limiting routes of administration for the modified nucleic acids or mmRNA of the present invention are described below. Parenteral and Injectible Administration Liquid dosage forms for parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and/or elixirs. In addition to active ingredients, liquid dosage forms may comprise inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, oral compositions can include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and/or perfuming agents. In certain embodiments for parenteral administration, compositions are mixed with solubilizing agents such as CREMOPHOR®, alcohols, oils, modified oils, glycols, polysorbates, cyclodextrins, polymers, and/or combinations thereof. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing agents, wetting agents, and/or suspending agents. Sterile injectable preparations may be sterile injectable solutions, suspensions, and/or emulsions in nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluents and/or solvents, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P., and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids such as oleic acid can be used in the preparation of injectables. Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, and/or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the effect of an active ingredient, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the active ingredient from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. Rectal and Vaginal Administration Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are typically suppositories which can be prepared by mixing compositions with suitable non-irritating excipients such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active ingredient. Oral Administration Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and/or elixirs. In addition to active ingredients, liquid dosage forms may comprise inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, oral compositions can include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and/or perfuming agents. In certain embodiments for parenteral administration, compositions are mixed with solubilizing agents such as CREMOPHOR®, alcohols, oils, modified oils, glycols, polysorbates, cyclodextrins, polymers, and/or combinations thereof. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, an active ingredient is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or fillers or extenders (e.g. starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid), binders (e.g. carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia), humectants (e.g. glycerol), disintegrating agents (e.g. agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate), solution retarding agents (e.g. paraffin), absorption accelerators (e.g. quaternary ammonium compounds), wetting agents (e.g. cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate), absorbents (e.g. kaolin and bentonite clay), and lubricants (e.g. talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate), and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may comprise buffering agents. Topical or Transdermal Administration As described herein, compositions containing the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA of the invention may be formulated for administration topically. The skin may be an ideal target site for delivery as it is readily accessible. Gene expression may be restricted not only to the skin, potentially avoiding nonspecific toxicity, but also to specific layers and cell types within the skin. The site of cutaneous expression of the delivered compositions will depend on the route of nucleic acid delivery. Three routes are commonly considered to deliver modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA to the skin: (i) topical application (e.g. for local/regional treatment); (ii) intradermal injection (e.g. for local/regional treatment); and (iii) systemic delivery (e.g. for treatment of dermatologic diseases that affect both cutaneous and extracutaneous regions). Modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA can be delivered to the skin by several different approaches known in the art. Most topical delivery approaches have been shown to work for delivery of DNA, such as but not limited to, topical application of non-cationic liposome-DNA complex, cationic liposome-DNA complex, particle-mediated (gene gun), puncture-mediated gene transfections, and viral delivery approaches. After delivery of the nucleic acid, gene products have been detected in a number of different skin cell types, including, but not limited to, basal keratinocytes, sebaceous gland cells, dermal fibroblasts and dermal macrophages. In one embodiment, the invention provides for a variety of dressings (e.g., wound dressings) or bandages (e.g., adhesive bandages) for conveniently and/or effectively carrying out methods of the present invention. Typically dressing or bandages may comprise sufficient amounts of pharmaceutical compositions and/or modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA described herein to allow a user to perform multiple treatments of a subject(s). In one embodiment, the invention provides for the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA compositions to be delivered in more than one injection. In one embodiment, before topical and/or transdermal administration at least one area of tissue, such as skin, may be subjected to a device and/or solution which may increase permeability. In one embodiment, the tissue may be subjected to an abrasion device to increase the permeability of the skin (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 20080275468, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). In another embodiment, the tissue may be subjected to an ultrasound enhancement device. An ultrasound enhancement device may include, but is not limited to, the devices described in U.S. Publication No. 20040236268 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,491,657 and 6,234,990; each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Methods of enhancing the permeability of tissue are described in U.S. Publication Nos. 20040171980 and 20040236268 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,315; each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In one embodiment, a device may be used to increase permeability of tissue before delivering formulations of modified mRNA described herein. The permeability of skin may be measured by methods known in the art and/or described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,315, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. As a non-limiting example, a modified mRNA formulation may be delivered by the drug delivery methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,315, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another non-limiting example tissue may be treated with a eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) cream before, during and/or after the tissue may be subjected to a device which may increase permeability. Katz et al. (Anesth Analg (2004); 98:371-76; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) showed that using the EMLA cream in combination with a low energy, an onset of superficial cutaneous analgesia was seen as fast as 5 minutes after a pretreatment with a low energy ultrasound. In one embodiment, enhancers may be applied to the tissue before, during, and/or after the tissue has been treated to increase permeability. Enhancers include, but are not limited to, transport enhancers, physical enhancers, and cavitation enhancers. Non-limiting examples of enhancers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,190,315, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, a device may be used to increase permeability of tissue before delivering formulations of modified mRNA described herein, which may further contain a substance that invokes an immune response. In another non-limiting example, a formulation containing a substance to invoke an immune response may be delivered by the methods described in U.S. Publication Nos. 20040171980 and 20040236268; each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. Dosage forms for topical and/or transdermal administration of a composition may include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants and/or patches. Generally, an active ingredient is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and/or any needed preservatives and/or buffers as may be required. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which often have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms may be prepared, for example, by dissolving and/or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Alternatively or additionally, rate may be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane and/or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix and/or gel. Formulations suitable for topical administration include, but are not limited to, liquid and/or semi liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, oil in water and/or water in oil emulsions such as creams, ointments and/or pastes, and/or solutions and/or suspensions. Topically-administrable formulations may, for example, comprise from about 0.1% to about 10% (w/w) active ingredient, although the concentration of active ingredient may be as high as the solubility limit of the active ingredient in the solvent. Formulations for topical administration may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. Depot Administration As described herein, in some embodiments, the composition is formulated in depots for extended release. Generally, a specific organ or tissue (a “target tissue”) is targeted for administration. In some aspects of the invention, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA are spatially retained within or proximal to a target tissue. Provided are method of providing a composition to a target tissue of a mammalian subject by contacting the target tissue (which contains one or more target cells) with the composition under conditions such that the composition, in particular the nucleic acid component(s) of the composition, is substantially retained in the target tissue, meaning that at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.9, 99.99 or greater than 99.99% of the composition is retained in the target tissue. Advantageously, retention is determined by measuring the amount of the nucleic acid present in the composition that enters one or more target cells. For example, at least 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.9, 99.99 or greater than 99.99% of the nucleic acids administered to the subject are present intracellularly at a period of time following administration. For example, intramuscular injection to a mammalian subject is performed using an aqueous composition containing a ribonucleic acid and a transfection reagent, and retention of the composition is determined by measuring the amount of the ribonucleic acid present in the muscle cells. Aspects of the invention are directed to methods of providing a composition to a target tissue of a mammalian subject, by contacting the target tissue (containing one or more target cells) with the composition under conditions such that the composition is substantially retained in the target tissue. The composition contains an effective amount of a nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA such that the polypeptide of interest is produced in at least one target cell. The compositions generally contain a cell penetration agent, although “naked” nucleic acid (such as nucleic acids without a cell penetration agent or other agent) is also contemplated, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some circumstances, the amount of a protein produced by cells in a tissue is desirably increased. Preferably, this increase in protein production is spatially restricted to cells within the target tissue. Thus, provided are methods of increasing production of a protein of interest in a tissue of a mammalian subject. A composition is provided that contains modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA characterized in that a unit quantity of composition has been determined to produce the polypeptide of interest in a substantial percentage of cells contained within a predetermined volume of the target tissue. In some embodiments, the composition includes a plurality of different modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA, where one or more than one of the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA encodes a polypeptide of interest. Optionally, the composition also contains a cell penetration agent to assist in the intracellular delivery of the composition. A determination is made of the dose of the composition required to produce the polypeptide of interest in a substantial percentage of cells contained within the predetermined volume of the target tissue (generally, without inducing significant production of the polypeptide of interest in tissue adjacent to the predetermined volume, or distally to the target tissue). Subsequent to this determination, the determined dose is introduced directly into the tissue of the mammalian subject. In one embodiment, the invention provides for the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA to be delivered in more than one injection or by split dose injections. In one embodiment, the invention may be retained near target tissue using a small disposable drug reservoir, patch pump or osmotic pump. Non-limiting examples of patch pumps include those manufactured and/or sold by BD®, (Franklin Lakes, N.J.), Insulet Corporation (Bedford, Mass.), SteadyMed Therapeutics (San Francisco, Calif.), Medtronic (Minneapolis, Minn.) (e.g., MiniMed), UniLife (York, Pa.), Valeritas (Bridgewater, N.J.), and SpringLeaf Therapeutics (Boston, Mass.). A non-limiting example of an osmotic pump include those manufactured by DURECT® (Cupertino, Calif.) (e.g., DUROS® and ALZET®). Pulmonary Administration A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity. Such a formulation may comprise dry particles which comprise the active ingredient and which have a diameter in the range from about 0.5 nm to about 7 nm or from about 1 nm to about 6 nm. Such compositions are suitably in the form of dry powders for administration using a device comprising a dry powder reservoir to which a stream of propellant may be directed to disperse the powder and/or using a self propelling solvent/powder dispensing container such as a device comprising the active ingredient dissolved and/or suspended in a low-boiling propellant in a sealed container. Such powders comprise particles wherein at least 98% of the particles by weight have a diameter greater than 0.5 nm and at least 95% of the particles by number have a diameter less than 7 nm. Alternatively, at least 95% of the particles by weight have a diameter greater than 1 nm and at least 90% of the particles by number have a diameter less than 6 nm. Dry powder compositions may include a solid fine powder diluent such as sugar and are conveniently provided in a unit dose form. Low boiling propellants generally include liquid propellants having a boiling point of below 65° F. at atmospheric pressure. Generally the propellant may constitute 50% to 99.9% (w/w) of the composition, and active ingredient may constitute 0.1% to 20% (w/w) of the composition. A propellant may further comprise additional ingredients such as a liquid non-ionic and/or solid anionic surfactant and/or a solid diluent (which may have a particle size of the same order as particles comprising the active ingredient). As a non-limiting example, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA described herein may be formulated for pulmonary delivery by the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,257,685; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Pharmaceutical compositions formulated for pulmonary delivery may provide an active ingredient in the form of droplets of a solution and/or suspension. Such formulations may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold as aqueous and/or dilute alcoholic solutions and/or suspensions, optionally sterile, comprising active ingredient, and may conveniently be administered using any nebulization and/or atomization device. Such formulations may further comprise one or more additional ingredients including, but not limited to, a flavoring agent such as saccharin sodium, a volatile oil, a buffering agent, a surface active agent, and/or a preservative such as methylhydroxybenzoate. Droplets provided by this route of administration may have an average diameter in the range from about 0.1 nm to about 200 nm. Intranasal, Nasal and Buccal Administration Formulations described herein as being useful for pulmonary delivery are useful for intranasal delivery of a pharmaceutical composition. Another formulation suitable for intranasal administration is a coarse powder comprising the active ingredient and having an average particle from about 0.2 μm to 500 μm. Such a formulation is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close to the nose. Formulations suitable for nasal administration may, for example, comprise from about as little as 0.1% (w/w) and as much as 100% (w/w) of active ingredient, and may comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for buccal administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the form of tablets and/or lozenges made using conventional methods, and may, for example, 0.1% to 20% (w/w) active ingredient, the balance comprising an orally dissolvable and/or degradable composition and, optionally, one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. Alternately, formulations suitable for buccal administration may comprise a powder and/or an aerosolized and/or atomized solution and/or suspension comprising active ingredient. Such powdered, aerosolized, and/or aerosolized formulations, when dispersed, may have an average particle and/or droplet size in the range from about 0.1 nm to about 200 nm, and may further comprise one or more of any additional ingredients described herein. Ophthalmic Administration A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for ophthalmic administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the form of eye drops including, for example, a 0.1/1.0% (w/w) solution and/or suspension of the active ingredient in an aqueous or oily liquid excipient. Such drops may further comprise buffering agents, salts, and/or one or more other of any additional ingredients described herein. Other ophthalmically-administrable formulations which are useful include those which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form and/or in a liposomal preparation. Ear drops and/or eye drops are contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. A multilayer thin film device may be prepared to contain a pharmaceutical composition for delivery to the eye and/or surrounding tissue. Payload Administration Detectable Agents and Therapeutic Agents The modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA described herein can be used in a number of different scenarios in which delivery of a substance (the “payload”) to a biological target is desired, for example delivery of detectable substances for detection of the target, or delivery of a therapeutic agent. Detection methods can include, but are not limited to, both imaging in vitro and in vivo imaging methods, e.g., immunohistochemistry, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), electron microscopy, X-ray computed tomography, Raman imaging, optical coherence tomography, absorption imaging, thermal imaging, fluorescence reflectance imaging, fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence molecular tomographic imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray imaging, ultrasound imaging, photoacoustic imaging, lab assays, or in any situation where tagging/staining/imaging is required. The modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA can be designed to include both a linker and a payload in any useful orientation. For example, a linker having two ends is used to attach one end to the payload and the other end to the nucleobase, such as at the C-7 or C-8 positions of the deaza-adenosine or deaza-guanosine or to the N-3 or C-5 positions of cytosine or uracil. The polynucleotide of the invention can include more than one payload (e.g., a label and a transcription inhibitor), as well as a cleavable linker. In one embodiment, the modified nucleotide is a modified 7-deaza-adenosine triphosphate, where one end of a cleavable linker is attached to the C7 position of 7-deaza-adenine, the other end of the linker is attached to an inhibitor (e.g., to the C5 position of the nucleobase on a cytidine), and a label (e.g., Cy5) is attached to the center of the linker (see, e.g., compound 1 of A*pCp C5 Parg Capless in FIG. 5 and columns 9 and 10 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,994,304, incorporated herein by reference). Upon incorporation of the modified 7-deaza-adenosine triphosphate to an encoding region, the resulting polynucleotide having a cleavable linker attached to a label and an inhibitor (e.g., a polymerase inhibitor). Upon cleavage of the linker (e.g., with reductive conditions to reduce a linker having a cleavable disulfide moiety), the label and inhibitor are released. Additional linkers and payloads (e.g., therapeutic agents, detectable labels, and cell penetrating payloads) are described herein. Scheme 12 below depicts an exemplary modified nucleotide wherein the nucleobase, adenine, is attached to a linker at the C-7 carbon of 7-deaza adenine. In addition, Scheme 12 depicts the modified nucleotide with the linker and payload, e.g., a detectable agent, incorporated onto the 3′ end of the mRNA. Disulfide cleavage and 1,2-addition of the thiol group onto the propargyl ester releases the detectable agent. The remaining structure (depicted, for example, as pApC5 Parg in Scheme 12) is the inhibitor. The rationale for the structure of the modified nucleotides is that the tethered inhibitor sterically interferes with the ability of the polymerase to incorporate a second base. Thus, it is critical that the tether be long enough to affect this function and that the inhibitor be in a stereochemical orientation that inhibits or prohibits second and follow on nucleotides into the growing polynucleotide strand. For example, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA described herein can be used in reprogramming induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), which can directly track cells that are transfected compared to total cells in the cluster. In another example, a drug that may be attached to the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA via a linker and may be fluorescently labeled can be used to track the drug in vivo, e.g. intracellularly. Other examples include, but are not limited to, the use of modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA in reversible drug delivery into cells. The modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA described herein can be used in intracellular targeting of a payload, e.g., detectable or therapeutic agent, to specific organelle. Exemplary intracellular targets can include, but are not limited to, the nuclear localization for advanced mRNA processing, or a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) linked to the mRNA containing an inhibitor. In addition, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA described herein can be used to deliver therapeutic agents to cells or tissues, e.g., in living animals. For example, the modified nucleic acids or mmRNA described herein can be used to deliver highly polar chemotherapeutics agents to kill cancer cells. The modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA attached to the therapeutic agent through a linker can facilitate member permeation allowing the therapeutic agent to travel into a cell to reach an intracellular target. In one example, the linker is attached at the 2′-position of the ribose ring and/or at the 3′ and/or 5′ position of the modified nucleic acid molecule or mmRNA (See e.g., International Pub. No. WO2012030683, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The linker may be any linker disclosed herein, known in the art and/or disclosed in International Pub. No. WO2012030683, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another example, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA can be attached to the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA a viral inhibitory peptide (VIP) through a cleavable linker. The cleavable linker can release the VIP and dye into the cell. In another example, the modified nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA can be attached through the linker to an ADP-ribosylate, which is responsible for the actions of some bacterial toxins, such as cholera toxin, diphtheria toxin, and pertussis toxin. These toxin proteins are ADP-ribosyltransferases that modify target proteins in human cells. For example, cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates G proteins modifies human cells by causing massive fluid secretion from the lining of the small intestine, which results in life-threatening diarrhea. In some embodiments, the payload may be a therapeutic agent such as a cytotoxin, radioactive ion, chemotherapeutic, or other therapeutic agent. A cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent includes any agent that may be detrimental to cells. Examples include, but are not limited to, taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, teniposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxyanthracinedione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, puromycin, maytansinoids, e.g., maytansinol (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 incorporated herein in its entirety), rachelmycin (CC-1065, see U.S. Pat.

In vitro assays in which the enzyme labeled compositions can be used include, but are not limited to, enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunoprecipitation assays, immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassays (EIA), radioimmunoassays (RIA), and Western blot analysis. Combinations The nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA may be used in combination with one or more other therapeutic, prophylactic, diagnostic, or imaging agents. By “in combination with,” it is not intended to imply that the agents must be administered at the same time and/or formulated for delivery together, although these methods of delivery are within the scope of the present disclosure. Compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. In general, each agent will be administered at a dose and/or on a time schedule determined for that agent. In some embodiments, the present disclosure encompasses the delivery of pharmaceutical, prophylactic, diagnostic, or imaging compositions in combination with agents that may improve their bioavailability, reduce and/or modify their metabolism, inhibit their excretion, and/or modify their distribution within the body. As a non-limiting example, the nucleic acid molecules or mmRNA may be used in combination with a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of cancer or to control hyperproliferative cells. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,964,571, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, a combination therapy for the treatment of solid primary or metastasized tumor is described using a pharmaceutical composition including a DNA plasmid encoding for interleukin-12 with a lipopolymer and also administering at least one anticancer agent or chemotherapeutic. Further, the nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA of the present invention that encodes anti-proliferative molecules may be in a pharmaceutical composition with a lipopolymer (see e.g., U.S. Pub. No. 20110218231, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, claiming a pharmaceutical composition comprising a DNA plasmid encoding an anti-proliferative molecule and a lipopolymer) which may be administered with at least one chemotherapeutic or anticancer agent. Cell Penetrating Payloads In some embodiments, the modified nucleotides and modified nucleic acid molecules, which are incorporated into a nucleic acid, e.g., RNA or mRNA, can also include a payload that can be a cell penetrating moiety or agent that enhances intracellular delivery of the compositions. For example, the compositions can include, but are not limited to, a cell-penetrating peptide sequence that facilitates delivery to the intracellular space, e.g., HIV-derived TAT peptide, penetratins, transportans, or hCT derived cell-penetrating peptides, see, e.g., Caron et al., (2001) Mol Ther. 3(3):310-8; Langel, Cell-Penetrating Peptides: Processes and Applications (CRC Press, Boca Raton Fla. 2002); El-Andaloussi et al., (2005) Curr Pharm Des. 11(28):3597-611; and Deshayes et al., (2005) Cell Mol Life Sci. 62(16):1839-49; all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The compositions can also be formulated to include a cell penetrating agent, e.g., liposomes, which enhance delivery of the compositions to the intracellular space. Biological Targets The modified nucleotides and modified nucleic acid molecules described herein, which are incorporated into a nucleic acid, e.g., RNA or mRNA, can be used to deliver a payload to any biological target for which a specific ligand exists or can be generated. The ligand can bind to the biological target either covalently or non-covalently. Examples of biological targets include, but are not limited to, biopolymers, e.g., antibodies, nucleic acids such as RNA and DNA, proteins, enzymes; examples of proteins include, but are not limited to, enzymes, receptors, and ion channels. In some embodiments the target may be a tissue- or a cell-type specific marker, e.g., a protein that is expressed specifically on a selected tissue or cell type. In some embodiments, the target may be a receptor, such as, but not limited to, plasma membrane receptors and nuclear receptors; more specific examples include, but are not limited to, G-protein-coupled receptors, cell pore proteins, transporter proteins, surface-expressed antibodies, HLA proteins, MHC proteins and growth factor receptors. Dosing The present invention provides methods comprising administering modified mRNAs and their encoded proteins or complexes in accordance with the invention to a subject in need thereof. Nucleic acids, proteins or complexes, or pharmaceutical, imaging, diagnostic, or prophylactic compositions thereof, may be administered to a subject using any amount and any route of administration effective for preventing, treating, diagnosing, or imaging a disease, disorder, and/or condition (e.g., a disease, disorder, and/or condition relating to working memory deficits). The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the disease, the particular composition, its mode of administration, its mode of activity, and the like. Compositions in accordance with the invention are typically formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compositions of the present invention may be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective, prophylactically effective, or appropriate imaging dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. In certain embodiments, compositions in accordance with the present invention may be administered at dosage levels sufficient to deliver from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 0.05 mg/kg, from about 0.005 mg/kg to about 0.05 mg/kg, from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 0.005 mg/kg, from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg, from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, or from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic, or imaging effect. The desired dosage may be delivered three times a day, two times a day, once a day, every other day, every third day, every week, every two weeks, every three weeks, or every four weeks. In certain embodiments, the desired dosage may be delivered using multiple administrations (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, or more administrations). According to the present invention, it has been discovered that administration of mmRNA in split-dose regimens produce higher levels of proteins in mammalian subjects. As used herein, a “split dose” is the division of single unit dose or total daily dose into two or more doses, e.g, two or more administrations of the single unit dose. As used herein, a “single unit dose” is a dose of any therapeutic administered in one dose/at one time/single route/single point of contact, i.e., single administration event. As used herein, a “total daily dose” is an amount given or prescribed in 24 hr period. It may be administered as a single unit dose. In one embodiment, the mmRNA of the present invention are administered to a subject in split doses. The mmRNA may be formulated in buffer only or in a formulation described herein. Dosage Forms A pharmaceutical composition described herein can be formulated into a dosage form described herein, such as a topical, intranasal, intratracheal, or injectable (e.g., intravenous, intraocular, intravitreal, intramuscular, intracardiac, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous). Liquid Dosage Forms Liquid dosage forms for parenteral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and/or elixirs. In addition to active ingredients, liquid dosage forms may comprise inert diluents commonly used in the art including, but not limited to, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments for parenteral administration, compositions may be mixed with solubilizing agents such as CREMOPHOR®, alcohols, oils, modified oils, glycols, polysorbates, cyclodextrins, polymers, and/or combinations thereof. Injectable Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art and may include suitable dispersing agents, wetting agents, and/or suspending agents. Sterile injectable preparations may be sterile injectable solutions, suspensions, and/or emulsions in nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluents and/or solvents, for example, a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed include, but are not limited to, water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P., and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids such as oleic acid can be used in the preparation of injectables. Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, and/or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the effect of an active ingredient, it may be desirable to slow the absorption of the active ingredient from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of modified mRNA then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered modified mRNA may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the modified mRNA in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the modified mRNA in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of modified mRNA to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of modified mRNA release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include, but are not limited to, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations may be prepared by entrapping the modified mRNA in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. Pulmonary Formulations described herein as being useful for pulmonary delivery may also be used for intranasal delivery of a pharmaceutical composition. Another formulation suitable for intranasal administration may be a coarse powder comprising the active ingredient and having an average particle from about 0.2 μm to 500 μm. Such a formulation may be administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close to the nose. Formulations suitable for nasal administration may, for example, comprise from about as little as 0.1% (w/w) and as much as 100% (w/w) of active ingredient, and may comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for buccal administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the form of tablets and/or lozenges made using conventional methods, and may, for example, contain about 0.1% to 20% (w/w) active ingredient, where the balance may comprise an orally dissolvable and/or degradable composition and, optionally, one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. Alternately, formulations suitable for buccal administration may comprise a powder and/or an aerosolized and/or atomized solution and/or suspension comprising active ingredient. Such powdered, aerosolized, and/or aerosolized formulations, when dispersed, may have an average particle and/or droplet size in the range from about 0.1 nm to about 200 nm, and may further comprise one or more of any additional ingredients described herein. General considerations in the formulation and/or manufacture of pharmaceutical agents may be found, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Coatings or Shells Solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally comprise opacifying agents and can be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. Properties of the Pharmaceutical Compositions The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be characterized by one or more of the following properties: Bioavailability The modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA, when formulated into a composition with a delivery agent as described herein, can exhibit an increase in bioavailability as compared to a composition lacking a delivery agent as described herein. As used herein, the term “bioavailability” refers to the systemic availability of a given amount of a modified nucleic acid molecule administered to a mammal. Bioavailability can be assessed by measuring the area under the curve (AUC) or the maximum serum or plasma concentration (Cmax) of the unchanged form of a compound following administration of the compound to a mammal. AUC is a determination of the area under the curve plotting the serum or plasma concentration of a compound along the ordinate (Y-axis) against time along the abscissa (X-axis). Generally, the AUC for a particular compound can be calculated using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art and as described in G. S. Banker, Modern Pharmaceutics, Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences, v. 72, Marcel Dekker, New York, Inc., 1996, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The Cmax value is the maximum concentration of the compound achieved in the serum or plasma of a mammal following administration of the compound to the mammal. The Cmax value of a particular compound can be measured using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The phrases “increasing bioavailability” or “improving the pharmacokinetics,” as used herein mean that the systemic availability of a first modified nucleic acid molecule, measured as AUC, Cmax, or Cmin in a mammal is greater, when co-administered with a delivery agent as described herein, than when such co-administration does not take place. In some embodiments, the bioavailability of the modified nucleic acid molecule can increase by at least about 2%, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or about 100%. Therapeutic Window The modified nucleic acid molecules and mmRNA when formulated into a composition with a delivery agent as described herein, can exhibit an increase in the therapeutic window of the administered modified nucleic acid molecule composition as compared to the therapeutic window of the administered modified nucleic acid molecule composition lacking a delivery agent as described herein. As used herein “therapeutic window” refers to the range of plasma concentrations, or the range of levels of therapeutically active substance at the site of action, with a high probability of eliciting a therapeutic effect. In some embodiments, the therapeutic window of the modified nucleic acid molecule when co-administered with a delivery agent as described herein can increase by at least about 2%, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or about 100%. Volume of Distribution The modified nucleic acid molecules, when formulated into a composition with a delivery agent as described herein, can exhibit an improved volume of distribution (Vdist), e.g., reduced or targeted, relative to a modified nucleic acid molecule composition lacking a delivery agent as described herein. The volume of distribution (Vdist) relates the amount of the drug in the body to the concentration of the drug in the blood or plasma. As used herein, the term “volume of distribution” refers to the fluid volume that would be required to contain the total amount of the drug in the body at the same concentration as in the blood or plasma: Vdist equals the amount of drug in the body/concentration of drug in blood or plasma. For example, for a 10 mg dose and a plasma concentration of 10 mg/L, the volume of distribution would be 1 liter. The volume of distribution reflects the extent to which the drug is present in the extravascular tissue. A large volume of distribution reflects the tendency of a compound to bind to the tissue components compared with plasma protein binding. In a clinical setting, Vdist can be used to determine a loading dose to achieve a steady state concentration. In some embodiments, the volume of distribution of the modified nucleic acid molecule when co-administered with a delivery agent as described herein can decrease at least about 2%, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%. Biological Effect In one embodiment, the biological effect of the modified mRNA delivered to the animals may be categorized by analyzing the protein expression in the animals. The protein expression may be determined from analyzing a biological sample collected from a mammal administered the modified mRNA of the present invention. In one embodiment, the expression protein encoded by the modified mRNA administered to the mammal of at least 50 pg/ml may be preferred. For example, a protein expression of 50-200 pg/ml for the protein encoded by the modified mRNA delivered to the mammal may be seen as a therapeutically effective amount of protein in the mammal. Detection of Modified Nucleic Acids by Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that can provide structural and molecular mass/concentration information on molecules after their conversion to ions. The molecules are first ionized to acquire positive or negative charges and then they travel through the mass analyzer to arrive at different areas of the detector according to their mass/charge (m/z) ratio. Mass spectrometry is performed using a mass spectrometer which includes an ion source for ionizing the fractionated sample and creating charged molecules for further analysis. For example ionization of the sample may be performed by electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), photoionization, electron ionization, fast atom bombardment (FAB)/liquid secondary ionization (LSIMS), matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), field ionization, field desorption, thermospray/plasmaspray ionization, and particle beam ionization. The skilled artisan will understand that the choice of ionization method can be determined based on the analyte to be measured, type of sample, the type of detector, the choice of positive versus negative mode, etc. After the sample has been ionized, the positively charged or negatively charged ions thereby created may be analyzed to determine a mass-to-charge ratio (i.e., m/z). Suitable analyzers for determining mass-to-charge ratios include quadropole analyzers, ion traps analyzers, and time-of-flight analyzers. The ions may be detected using several detection modes. For example, selected ions may be detected (i.e., using a selective ion monitoring mode (SIM)), or alternatively, ions may be detected using a scanning mode, e.g., multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) or selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MS/MRM) coupled with stable isotope labeled dilution of peptide standards has been shown to be an effective method for protein verification (e.g., Keshishian et al., Mol Cell Proteomics 2009 8: 2339-2349; Kuhn et al., Clin Chem 2009 55:1108-1117; Lopez et al., Clin Chem 2010 56:281-290; each of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Unlike untargeted mass spectrometry frequently used in biomarker discovery studies, targeted MS methods are peptide sequence-based modes of MS that focus the full analytical capacity of the instrument on tens to hundreds of selected peptides in a complex mixture. By restricting detection and fragmentation to only those peptides derived from proteins of interest, sensitivity and reproducibility are improved dramatically compared to discovery-mode MS methods. This method of mass spectrometry-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) quantitation of proteins can dramatically impact the discovery and quantitation of biomarkers via rapid, targeted, multiplexed protein expression profiling of clinical samples. In one embodiment, a biological sample which may contain at least one protein encoded by at least one modified mRNA of the present invention may be analyzed by the method of MRM-MS. The quantification of the biological sample may further include, but is not limited to, isotopically labeled peptides or proteins as internal standards. According to the present invention, the biological sample, once obtained from the subject, may be subjected to enzyme digestion. As used herein, the term “digest” means to break apart into shorter peptides. As used herein, the phrase “treating a sample to digest proteins” means manipulating a sample in such a way as to break down proteins in a sample. These enzymes include, but are not limited to, trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C and chymotrypsin. In one embodiment, a biological sample which may contain at least one protein encoded by at least one modified mRNA of the present invention may be digested using enzymes. In one embodiment, a biological sample which may contain protein encoded by modified mRNA of the present invention may be analyzed for protein using electrospray ionization. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (ESIMS) uses electrical energy to aid in the transfer of ions from the solution to the gaseous phase before they are analyzed by mass spectrometry. Samples may be analyzed using methods known in the art (e.g., Ho et al., Clin Biochem Rev. 2003 24(1):3-12; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The ionic species contained in solution may be transferred into the gas phase by dispersing a fine spray of charge droplets, evaporating the solvent and ejecting the ions from the charged droplets to generate a mist of highly charged droplets. The mist of highly charged droplets may be analyzed using at least 1, at least 2, at least 3 or at least 4 mass analyzers such as, but not limited to, a quadropole mass analyzer. Further, the mass spectrometry method may include a purification step. As a non-limiting example, the first quadrapole may be set to select a single m/z ratio so it may filter out other molecular ions having a different m/z ratio which may eliminate complicated and time-consuming sample purification procedures prior to MS analysis. In one embodiment, a biological sample which may contain protein encoded by modified mRNA of the present invention may be analyzed for protein in a tandem ESIMS system (e.g., MS/MS). As non-limiting examples, the droplets may be analyzed using a product scan (or daughter scan) a precursor scan (parent scan) a neutral loss or a multiple reaction monitoring. In one embodiment, a biological sample which may contain protein encoded by modified mRNA of the present invention may be analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MALDIMS). MALDI provides for the nondestructive vaporization and ionization of both large and small molecules, such as proteins. In MALDI analysis, the analyte is first co-crystallized with a large molar excess of a matrix compound, which may also include, but is not limited to, an ultraviolet absorbing weak organic acid. Non-limiting examples of matrices used in MALDI are α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Laser radiation of the analyte-matrix mixture may result in the vaporization of the matrix and the analyte. The laser induced desorption provides high ion yields of the intact analyte and allows for measurement of compounds with high accuracy. Samples may be analyzed using methods known in the art (e.g., Lewis, Wei and Siuzdak, Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry 2000:5880-5894; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). As non-limiting examples, mass analyzers used in the MALDI analysis may include a linear time-of-flight (TOF), a TOF reflectron or a Fourier transform mass analyzer. In one embodiment, the analyte-matrix mixture may be formed using the dried-droplet method. A biologic sample is mixed with a matrix to create a saturated matrix solution where the matrix-to-sample ratio is approximately 5000:1. An aliquot (approximately 0.5-2.0 uL) of the saturated matrix solution is then allowed to dry to form the analyte-matrix mixture. In one embodiment, the analyte-matrix mixture may be formed using the thin-layer method. A matrix homogeneous film is first formed and then the sample is then applied and may be absorbed by the matrix to form the analyte-matrix mixture. In one embodiment, the analyte-matrix mixture may be formed using the thick-layer method. A matrix homogeneous film is formed with a nitro-cellulose matrix additive. Once the uniform nitro-cellulose matrix layer is obtained the sample is applied and absorbed into the matrix to form the analyte-matrix mixture. In one embodiment, the analyte-matrix mixture may be formed using the sandwich method. A thin layer of matrix crystals is prepared as in the thin-layer method followed by the addition of droplets of aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, the sample and matrix. The sample is then absorbed into the matrix to form the analyte-matrix mixture.

For example, a modified nucleic acid molecule described herein can be administered to a subject, wherein the modified nucleic acid molecule is translated in vivo to produce a therapeutic peptide in the subject. Accordingly, provided herein are compositions, methods, kits, and reagents for treatment or prevention of disease or conditions in humans and other mammals. The active therapeutic agents of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, modified nucleic acid molecules, cells containing modified nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides translated from the modified nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides translated from modified nucleic acid molecules, and cells contacted with cells containing modified nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides translated from the modified nucleic acid molecules. In certain embodiments, combination therapeutics are provided which may containing one or more modified nucleic acid molecules containing translatable regions along with a protein that induces antibody-dependent cellular toxicity. As used herein “translatable regions” encode for a protein or proteins that may boost a subject's immunity. For example, provided herein are therapeutics containing one or more nucleic acids that encode trastuzumab and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). In particular, such combination therapeutics may be useful in Her2+ breast cancer patients who develop induced resistance to trastuzumab. (See, e.g., Albrecht, Immunotherapy. 2(6):795-8 (2010); herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Methods of inducing translation of a recombinant polypeptide in a cell population using the modified nucleic acid molecules described herein are also provided. Such translation can be in vivo, ex vivo, in culture, or in vitro. The cell population may be contacted with an effective amount of a composition containing a nucleic acid that has at least one nucleoside modification, and a translatable region encoding the recombinant polypeptide. The population may be contacted under conditions such that the nucleic acid may be localized into one or more cells of the cell population and the recombinant polypeptide may be translated in the cell from the nucleic acid. An effective amount of the composition may be provided based, at least in part, on the target tissue, target cell type, means of administration, physical characteristics of the nucleic acid (e.g., size, and extent of modified nucleosides), and other determinants. In general, an effective amount of the composition provides efficient protein production in the cell, preferably more efficient than a composition containing a corresponding unmodified nucleic acid molecule. Increased efficiency may be demonstrated by increased cell transfection (i.e., the percentage of cells transfected with the nucleic acid), increased protein translation from the nucleic acid, decreased nucleic acid degradation (as demonstrated, e.g., by increased duration of protein translation from a modified nucleic acid molecule), or reduced innate immune response of the host cell. Aspects of the present disclosure are directed to methods of inducing in vivo translation of a recombinant polypeptide in a mammalian subject in need thereof. Therein, an effective amount of a composition containing a nucleic acid that has at least one nucleoside modification and a translatable region encoding the recombinant polypeptide may be administered to the subject using the delivery methods described herein. The nucleic acid may be provided in an amount and under other conditions such that the nucleic acid is localized into a cell of the subject and the recombinant polypeptide may be translated in the cell from the nucleic acid. The cell in which the nucleic acid is localized, or the tissue in which the cell is present, may be targeted with one or more than one rounds of nucleic acid administration. Other aspects of the present disclosure relate to transplantation of cells containing modified nucleic acid molecules to a mammalian subject. Administration of cells to mammalian subjects is known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and include, but is not limited to, local implantation (e.g., topical or subcutaneous administration), organ delivery or systemic injection (e.g., intravenous injection or inhalation), and the formulation of cells in pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compositions containing modified nucleic acid molecules are formulated for administration intramuscularly, transarterially, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intranasally, subcutaneously, endoscopically, transdermally, or intrathecally. In some embodiments, the composition may be formulated for extended release. The subject to whom the therapeutic agent may be administered suffers from or may be at risk of developing a disease, disorder, or deleterious condition. Provided are methods of identifying, diagnosing, and classifying subjects on these bases, which may include clinical diagnosis, biomarker levels, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and other methods known in the art. In certain embodiments, the administered modified nucleic acid molecule directs production of one or more recombinant polypeptides that provide a functional activity which may be substantially absent in the cell in which the recombinant polypeptide may be translated. For example, the missing functional activity may be enzymatic, structural, or gene regulatory in nature. In other embodiments, the administration of a modified nucleic acid molecule directs production of one or more recombinant polypeptides that replace a polypeptide (or multiple polypeptides) that may be substantially absent in the cell in which the recombinant polypeptide may be translated. Such absence may be due to a genetic mutation of the encoding gene or a regulatory pathway thereof. Alternatively, the recombinant polypeptide functions to antagonize the activity of an endogenous protein present in, on the surface of, or secreted from the cell. Usually, the activity of the endogenous protein may be deleterious to the subject, for example, due to the mutation of the endogenous protein resulting in altered activity or localization. Additionally, the recombinant polypeptide antagonizes, directly or indirectly, the activity of a biological moiety present in, on the surface of, or secreted from the cell. Examples of antagonized biological moieties include, but are not limited to, lipids (e.g., cholesterol), a lipoprotein (e.g., low density lipoprotein), a nucleic acid, a carbohydrate, or a small molecule toxin. The recombinant proteins described herein may be engineered for localization within the cell, potentially within a specific compartment such as the nucleus, or are engineered for secretion from the cell or translocation to the plasma membrane of the cell. As described herein, a useful feature of the modified nucleic acid molecules of the present disclosure is the capacity to reduce the innate immune response of a cell to an exogenous nucleic acid. Provided are methods for performing the titration, reduction or elimination of the immune response in a cell or a population of cells. In some embodiments, the cell may be contacted with a first composition that contains a first dose of a first exogenous nucleic acid including a translatable region and at least one nucleoside modification, and the level of the innate immune response of the cell to the first exogenous nucleic acid may be determined. Subsequently, the cell may be contacted with a second composition, which includes a second dose of the first exogenous nucleic acid, the second dose containing a lesser amount of the first exogenous nucleic acid as compared to the first dose. Alternatively, the cell may be contacted with a first dose of a second exogenous nucleic acid. The second exogenous nucleic acid may contain one or more modified nucleosides, which may be the same or different from the first exogenous nucleic acid or, alternatively, the second exogenous nucleic acid may not contain modified nucleosides. The steps of contacting the cell with the first composition and/or the second composition may be repeated one or more times. Additionally, efficiency of protein production (e.g., protein translation) in the cell may be optionally determined, and the cell may be re-transfected with the first and/or second composition repeatedly until a target protein production efficiency is achieved. Therapeutics for Diseases and Conditions Provided herein are methods for treating or preventing a symptom of diseases, characterized by missing or aberrant protein activity, by supplying the missing protein activity or overcoming the aberrant protein activity. Because of the rapid initiation of protein production following introduction of modified mRNA, as compared to viral DNA vectors, the compounds of the present disclosure are particularly advantageous in treating acute diseases such as sepsis, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Moreover, an accurate titration of protein may be achievable using the modified mRNA of the present disclosure as the modified mRNA may be able to alter transcription rates and thus cause changes in gene expression. Diseases characterized by dysfunctional or aberrant protein activity include, but are not limited to, cancer and proliferative diseases, genetic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis), autoimmune diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic diseases. The present disclosure provides a method for treating such conditions or diseases in a subject by introducing nucleic acid or cell-based therapeutics containing the modified nucleic acid molecules provided herein, wherein the modified nucleic acid molecules encode for a protein that antagonizes or otherwise overcomes the aberrant protein activity present in the cell of the subject. Specific examples of a dysfunctional protein include, but are not limited to, the missense mutation variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which produce a dysfunctional protein variant of CFTR protein, which causes cystic fibrosis. Multiple diseases may be characterized by missing (or substantially diminished such that proper protein function does not occur) protein activity. Such proteins may not be present, or they may be essentially non-functional. Thus, provided are methods of treating cystic fibrosis in a mammalian subject by contacting a cell of the subject with a modified nucleic acid molecule having a translatable region that encodes a functional CFTR polypeptide, under conditions such that an effective amount of the CTFR polypeptide is present in the cell. Preferred target cells are epithelial cells, such as the lung, and methods of administration are determined in view of the target tissue; i.e., for lung delivery, the RNA molecules are formulated for administration by inhalation. In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for treating hyperlipidemia in a subject, by introducing into a cell population of the subject with a modified mRNA molecule encoding Sortilin, a protein recently characterized by genomic studies, thereby ameliorating the hyperlipidemia in a subject. The SORT1 gene encodes a trans-Golgi network (TGN) transmembrane protein called Sortilin. Genetic studies have shown that one of five individuals has a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs12740374, in the 1p13 locus of the SORT1 gene that predisposes them to having low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Each copy of the minor allele, present in about 30% of people, alters LDL cholesterol by 8 mg/dL, while two copies of the minor allele, present in about 5% of the population, lowers LDL cholesterol 16 mg/dL. Carriers of the minor allele have also been shown to have a 40% decreased risk of myocardial infarction. Functional in vivo studies in mice describes that overexpression of SORT1 in mouse liver tissue led to significantly lower LDL-cholesterol levels, as much as 80% lower, and that silencing SORT1 increased LDL cholesterol approximately 200% (Musunuru K et al. From noncoding variant to phenotype via SORT1 at the 1p13 cholesterol locus. Nature 2010; 466: 714-721; herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Methods of Cellular Nucleic Acid Delivery Methods of the present disclosure enhance nucleic acid delivery into a cell population, in vivo, ex vivo, or in culture. For example, a cell culture containing a plurality of host cells (e.g., eukaryotic cells such as yeast or mammalian cells) may be contacted with a composition that contains an modified nucleic acid molecule having at least one nucleoside modification and, optionally, a translatable region. The composition may also generally contain a transfection reagent or other compound that may increases the efficiency of modified nucleic acid molecule uptake into the host cells. The modified nucleic acid molecule may exhibit enhanced retention in the cell population, relative to a corresponding unmodified nucleic acid molecule. The retention of the modified nucleic acid molecule may greater than the retention of the unmodified nucleic acid molecule. In some embodiments, it is at least about 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 150%, 200% or more than 200% greater than the retention of the unmodified nucleic acid molecule. Such retention advantage may be achieved by one round of transfection with the modified nucleic acid molecule, or may be obtained following repeated rounds of transfection. In some embodiments, the modified nucleic acid molecule may be delivered to a target cell population with one or more additional nucleic acids. Such delivery may be at the same time, or the modified nucleic acid molecule is delivered prior to delivery of the one or more additional nucleic acids. The additional one or more nucleic acids may be modified nucleic acid molecules or unmodified nucleic acid molecules. It is understood that the initial presence of the modified nucleic acid molecules may not substantially induce an innate immune response of the cell population and, moreover, that the innate immune response may not be activated by the later presence of the unmodified nucleic acid molecules. In this regard, the enhanced nucleic acid may not itself contain a translatable region, if the protein desired to be present in the target cell population is translated from the unmodified nucleic acid molecules. Targeting Moieties In some embodiments, modified nucleic acid molecules are provided to express a protein-binding partner or a receptor on the surface of the cell, which may function to target the cell to a specific tissue space or to interact with a specific moiety, either in vivo or in vitro. Suitable protein-binding partners include, but are not limited to, antibodies and functional fragments thereof, scaffold proteins, or peptides. Additionally, modified nucleic acid molecules may be employed to direct the synthesis and extracellular localization of lipids, carbohydrates, or other biological moieties. Permanent Gene Expression Silencing A method for epigenetically silencing gene expression in a mammalian subject, comprising a nucleic acid where the translatable region encodes a polypeptide or polypeptides capable of directing sequence-specific histone H3 methylation to initiate heterochromatin formation and reduce gene transcription around specific genes for the purpose of silencing the gene. For example, a gain-of-function mutation in the Janus Kinase 2 gene is responsible for the family of Myeloproliferative Diseases. Expression of Ligand or Receptor on Cell Surface In some aspects and embodiments of the aspects described herein, the modified RNA can be used to express a ligand or ligand receptor on the surface of a cell (e.g., a homing moiety). A ligand or ligand receptor moiety attached to a cell surface can permit the cell to have a desired biological interaction with a tissue or an agent in vivo. A ligand can be an antibody, an antibody fragment, an aptamer, a peptide, a vitamin, a carbohydrate, a protein or polypeptide, a receptor, e.g., cell-surface receptor, an adhesion molecule, a glycoprotein, a sugar residue, a therapeutic agent, a drug, a glycosaminoglycan, or any combination thereof. For example, a ligand can be an antibody that recognizes a cancer-cell specific antigen, rendering the cell capable of preferentially interacting with tumor cells to permit tumor-specific localization of a modified cell. A ligand can confer the ability of a cell composition to accumulate in a tissue to be treated, since a preferred ligand may be capable of interacting with a target molecule on the external face of a tissue to be treated. Ligands having limited cross-reactivity to other tissues are generally preferred. In some cases, a ligand can act as a homing moiety which permits the cell to target to a specific tissue or interact with a specific ligand. Such homing moieties can include, but are not limited to, any member of a specific binding pair, antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, or derivatives or analogs thereof, including without limitation: Fv fragments, single chain Fv (scFv) fragments, Fab′ fragments, F(ab′)2 fragments, single domain antibodies, camelized antibodies and antibody fragments, humanized antibodies and antibody fragments, and multivalent versions of the foregoing; multivalent binding reagents including without limitation: monospecific or bispecific antibodies, such as disulfide stabilized Fv fragments, scFv tandems ((SCFV)2 fragments), diabodies, tribodies or tetrabodies, which typically are covalently linked or otherwise stabilized (i.e., leucine zipper or helix stabilized) scFv fragments; and other homing moieties include for example, aptamers, receptors, and fusion proteins. In some embodiments, the homing moiety may be a surface-bound antibody, which can permit tuning of cell targeting specificity. This is especially useful since highly specific antibodies can be raised against an epitope of interest for the desired targeting site. In one embodiment, multiple antibodies are expressed on the surface of a cell, and each antibody can have a different specificity for a desired target. Such approaches can increase the avidity and specificity of homing interactions. A skilled artisan can select any homing moiety based on the desired localization or function of the cell, for example an estrogen receptor ligand, such as tamoxifen, can target cells to estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells that have an increased number of estrogen receptors on the cell surface. Other non-limiting examples of ligand/receptor interactions include CCRI (e.g., for treatment of inflamed joint tissues or brain in rheumatoid arthritis, and/or multiple sclerosis), CCR7, CCR8 (e.g., targeting to lymph node tissue), CCR6, CCR9, CCR10 (e.g., to target to intestinal tissue), CCR4, CCR10 (e.g., for targeting to skin), CXCR4 (e.g., for general enhanced transmigration), HCELL (e.g., for treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders, bone marrow), Alpha4beta7 (e.g., for intestinal mucosa targeting), VLA-4/VCAM-1 (e.g., targeting to endothelium). In general, any receptor involved in targeting (e.g., cancer metastasis) can be harnessed for use in the methods and compositions described herein. Mediators of Cell Death In one embodiment, a modified nucleic acid molecule composition can be used to induce apoptosis in a cell (e.g., a cancer cell) by increasing the expression of a death receptor, a death receptor ligand or a combination thereof. This method can be used to induce cell death in any desired cell and has particular usefulness in the treatment of cancer where cells escape natural apoptotic signals. Apoptosis can be induced by multiple independent signaling pathways that converge upon a final effector mechanism consisting of multiple interactions between several “death receptors” and their ligands, which belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor/ligand superfamily. The best-characterized death receptors are CD95 (“Fas”), TNFRI (p55), death receptor 3 (DR3 or Apo3/TRAMO), DR4 and DR5 (apo2-TRAIL-R2). The final effector mechanism of apoptosis may be the activation of a series of proteinases designated as caspases. The activation of these caspases results in the cleavage of a series of vital cellular proteins and cell death. The molecular mechanism of death receptors/ligands-induced apoptosis is well known in the art. For example, Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis is induced by binding of three FasL molecules which induces trimerization of Fas receptor via C-terminus death domains (DDs), which in turn recruits an adapter protein FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) and Caspase-8. The oligomerization of this trimolecular complex, Fas/FAIDD/caspase-8, results in proteolytic cleavage of proenzyme caspase-8 into active caspase-8 that, in turn, initiates the apoptosis process by activating other downstream caspases through proteolysis, including caspase-3. Death ligands in general are apoptotic when formed into trimers or higher order of structures. As monomers, they may serve as antiapoptotic agents by competing with the trimers for binding to the death receptors. In one embodiment, the modified nucleic acid molecule composition encodes for a death receptor (e.g., Fas, TRAIL, TRAMO, TNFR, TLR etc). Cells made to express a death receptor by transfection of modified RNA become susceptible to death induced by the ligand that activates that receptor. Similarly, cells made to express a death ligand, e.g., on their surface, will induce death of cells with the receptor when the transfected cell contacts the target cell. In another embodiment, the modified RNA composition encodes for a death receptor ligand (e.g., FasL, TNF, etc). In another embodiment, the modified RNA composition encodes a caspase (e.g., caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 etc). Where cancer cells often exhibit a failure to properly differentiate to a non-proliferative or controlled proliferative form, in another embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNA composition encodes for both a death receptor and its appropriate activating ligand. In another embodiment, the synthetic, modified RNA composition encodes for a differentiation factor that when expressed in the cancer cell, such as a cancer stem cell, will induce the cell to differentiate to a non-pathogenic or nonself-renewing phenotype (e.g., reduced cell growth rate, reduced cell division etc) or to induce the cell to enter a dormant cell phase (e.g., G0 resting phase). One of skill in the art will appreciate that the use of apoptosis-inducing techniques may require that the modified nucleic acid molecules are appropriately targeted to e.g., tumor cells to prevent unwanted wide-spread cell death. Thus, one can use a delivery mechanism (e.g., attached ligand or antibody, targeted liposome etc) that recognizes a cancer antigen such that the modified nucleic acid molecules are expressed only in cancer cells.

Homology: As used herein, the term “homology” refers to the overall relatedness between polymeric molecules, e.g. between nucleic acid molecules (e.g. DNA molecules and/or RNA molecules) and/or between polypeptide molecules. In some embodiments, polymeric molecules are considered to be “homologous” to one another if their sequences are at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% identical or similar. The term “homologous” necessarily refers to a comparison between at least two sequences (polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences). In accordance with the invention, two polynucleotide sequences are considered to be homologous if the polypeptides they encode are at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or even 99% for at least one stretch of at least about 20 amino acids. In some embodiments, homologous polynucleotide sequences are characterized by the ability to encode a stretch of at least 4-5 uniquely specified amino acids. For polynucleotide sequences less than 60 nucleotides in length, homology is determined by the ability to encode a stretch of at least 4-5 uniquely specified amino acids. In accordance with the invention, two protein sequences are considered to be homologous if the proteins are at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% identical for at least one stretch of at least about 20 amino acids. Identity: As used herein, the term “identity” refers to the overall relatedness between polymeric molecules, e.g., between oligonucleotide molecules (e.g. DNA molecules and/or RNA molecules) and/or between polypeptide molecules. Calculation of the percent identity of two polynucleotide sequences, for example, can be performed by aligning the two sequences for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second nucleic acid sequences for optimal alignment and non-identical sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In certain embodiments, the length of a sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The nucleotides at corresponding nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which needs to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using methods such as those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press, 1987; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991; each of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller (CABIOS, 1989, 4:11-17), which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The percent identity between two nucleotide sequences can, alternatively, be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package using an NWSgapdna.CMP matrix. Methods commonly employed to determine percent identity between sequences include, but are not limited to those disclosed in Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J Applied Math., 48:1073 (1988); incorporated herein by reference. Techniques for determining identity are codified in publicly available computer programs. Exemplary computer software to determine homology between two sequences include, but are not limited to, GCG program package, Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 12(1), 387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA Altschul, S.

EXAMPLES The invention is further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims. Example 1 Modified mRNA Production Modified mRNAs (mmRNA) according to the invention may be made using standard laboratory methods and materials. The open reading frame (ORF) of the gene of interest may be flanked by a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) which may contain a strong Kozak translational initiation signal and/or an alpha-globin 3′ UTR which may include an oligo(dT) sequence for templated addition of a poly-A tail. The modified mRNAs may be modified to reduce the cellular innate immune response. The modifications to reduce the cellular response may include pseudouridine (ψ) and 5-methyl-cytidine (5meC or m5C). (see, Kariko K et al. Immunity 23:165-75 (2005), Kariko K et al. Mol Ther 16:1833-40 (2008), Anderson B R et al. NAR (2010); each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties). The ORF may also include various upstream or downstream additions (such as, but not limited to, β-globin, tags, etc.) may be ordered from an optimization service such as, but limited to, DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, Calif.) and may contain multiple cloning sites which may have XbaI recognition. Upon receipt of the plasmid DNA, it may be reconstituted and transformed into chemically competent E. coli. For the present invention, NEB DH5-alpha Competent E. coli are used. Transformations are performed according to NEB instructions using 100 ng of plasmid. The protocol is as follows: 1. Thaw a tube of NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes.2. Add 1-5 μl containing 1 pg-100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.3. Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix.4. Heat shock at 42° C. for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix.5. Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix.6. Pipette 950 μl of room temperature SOC into the mixture.7. Place at 37° C. for 60 minutes. Shake vigorously (250 rpm) or rotate.8. Warm selection plates to 37° C.9. Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting. Spread 50-100 μl of each dilution onto a selection plate and incubate overnight at 37° C. Alternatively, incubate at 30° C. for 24-36 hours or 25° C. for 48 hours. A single colony is then used to inoculate 5 ml of LB growth media using the appropriate antibiotic and then allowed to grow (250 RPM, 37° C.) for 5 hours. This is then used to inoculate a 200 ml culture medium and allowed to grow overnight under the same conditions. To isolate the plasmid (up to 850 μg), a maxi prep is performed using the Invitrogen PURELINK™ HiPure Maxiprep Kit (Carlsbad, Calif.), following the manufacturer's instructions. In order to generate cDNA for In Vitro Transcription (IVT), the plasmid (an Example of which is shown in FIG. 2) is first linearized using a restriction enzyme such as XbaI. A typical restriction digest with XbaI will comprise the following: Plasmid 1.0 μg; 10× Buffer 1.0 μl; XbaI 1.5 μl; dH20 up to 10 μl; incubated at 37° C. for 1 hr. If performing at lab scale (<5 μg), the reaction is cleaned up using Invitrogen's PURELINK™ PCR Micro Kit (Carlsbad, Calif.) per manufacturer's instructions. Larger scale purifications may need to be done with a product that has a larger load capacity such as Invitrogen's standard PURELINK™ PCR Kit (Carlsbad, Calif.). Following the cleanup, the linearized vector is quantified using the NanoDrop and analyzed to confirm linearization using agarose gel electrophoresis. The methods described herein to make modified mRNA may be used to produce molecules of all sizes including long molecules. Modified mRNA using the described methods has been made for different sized molecules including glucosidase, alpha; acid (GAA) (3.2 kb), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (4.7 kb), Factor VII (7.3 kb), lysosomal acid lipase (45.4 kDa), glucocerebrosidase (59.7 kDa) and iduronate 2-sulfatase (76 kDa). As a non-limiting example, G-CSF may represent the polypeptide of interest. Sequences used in the steps outlined in Examples 1-5 are shown in Table 4. It should be noted that the start codon (ATG) has been underlined in each sequence of Table 4.

This system includes 2×KAPA ReadyMix 12.5 μl; Forward Primer (10 uM) 0.75 μl; Reverse Primer (10 uM) 0.75 μl; Template cDNA 100 ng; and dH2O diluted to 25.0 μl. The reaction conditions are at 95° C. for 5 min. and 25 cycles of 98° C. for 20 sec, then 58° C. for 15 sec, then 72° C. for 45 sec, then 72° C. for 5 min. then 4° C. to termination. The reverse primer of the instant invention incorporates a poly-T120 for a poly-A120 in the mRNA. Other reverse primers with longer or shorter poly(T) tracts can be used to adjust the length of the poly(A) tail in the mRNA. The reaction is cleaned up using Invitrogen's PURELINK™ PCR Micro Kit (Carlsbad, Calif.) per manufacturer's instructions (up to 5 μg). Larger reactions will require a cleanup using a product with a larger capacity. Following the cleanup, the cDNA is quantified using the NANODROP™ and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the cDNA is the expected size. The cDNA is then submitted for sequencing analysis before proceeding to the in vitro transcription reaction. Example 3 In Vitro Transcription The in vitro transcription reaction generates mRNA containing modified nucleotides or modified RNA. The input nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) mix is made in-house using natural and un-natural NTPs. A typical in vitro transcription reaction includes the following: 1. Template cDNA 1.0 μg 2. 10x transcription buffer (400 mM Tris- 2.0 μl HCl pH 8.0, 190 mM MgCl2, 50 mM DTT, 10 mM Spermidine) 3. Custom NTPs (25 mM each) 7.2 μl 4. RNase Inhibitor 20 U 5. T7 RNA polymerase 3000 U 6. dH20 Up to 20.0 μl. and 7. Incubation at 37° C. for 3 hr-5 hrs. The crude IVT mix may be stored at 4° C. overnight for cleanup the next day. 1 U of RNase-free DNase is then used to digest the original template. After 15 minutes of incubation at 37° C., the mRNA is purified using Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ Kit (Austin, Tex.) following the manufacturer's instructions. This kit can purify up to 500 μg of RNA. Following the cleanup, the RNA is quantified using the NanoDrop and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the RNA is the proper size and that no degradation of the RNA has occurred. Example 4 Enzymatic Capping of mRNA Capping of the mRNA is performed as follows where the mixture includes: IVT RNA 60 μg-180 μg and dH2O up to 72 μl. The mixture is incubated at 65° C. for 5 minutes to denature RNA, and then is transferred immediately to ice. The protocol then involves the mixing of 10× Capping Buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mM KCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2) (10.0 μl); 20 mM GTP (5.0 μl); 20 mM S-Adenosyl Methionine (2.5 μl); RNase Inhibitor (100 U); 2′-O-Methyltransferase (400U); Vaccinia capping enzyme (Guanylyl transferase) (40 U); dH20 (Up to 28 μl); and incubation at 37° C. for 30 minutes for 60 μg RNA or up to 2 hours for 180 μg of RNA. The mRNA is then purified using Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ Kit (Austin, Tex.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Following the cleanup, the RNA is quantified using the NANODROP™ (ThermoFisher, Waltham, Mass.) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the RNA is the proper size and that no degradation of the RNA has occurred. The RNA product may also be sequenced by running a reverse-transcription-PCR to generate the cDNA for sequencing. Example 5 PolyA Tailing Reaction Without a poly-T in the cDNA, a poly-A tailing reaction must be performed before cleaning the final product. This is done by mixing Capped IVT RNA (100 μl); RNase Inhibitor (20 U); 10× Tailing Buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM MgCl2) (12.0 μl); 20 mM ATP (6.0 μl); Poly-A Polymerase (20 U); dH20 up to 123.5 μl and incubation at 37° C. for 30 min. If the poly-A tail is already in the transcript, then the tailing reaction may be skipped and proceed directly to cleanup with Ambion's MEGACLEAR™ kit (Austin, Tex.) (up to 500 μg). Poly-A Polymerase is preferably a recombinant enzyme expressed in yeast. For studies performed and described herein, the poly-A tail is encoded in the IVT template to comprise 160 nucleotides in length. However, it should be understood that the processivity or integrity of the polyA tailing reaction may not always result in exactly 160 nucleotides. Hence polyA tails of approximately 160 nucleotides, e.g, about 150-165, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164 or 165 are within the scope of the invention. Example 6 Natural 5′ Caps and 5′ Cap Analogues 5′-capping of modified RNA may be completed concomitantly during the in vitro-transcription reaction using the following chemical RNA cap analogs to generate the 5′-guanosine cap structure according to manufacturer protocols: 3′-O-Me-m7G(5′)ppp(5′) G [the ARCA cap]; G(5)ppp(5′)A; G(5′)ppp(5′)G; m7G(5′)ppp(5′)A; m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.). 5′-capping of modified RNA may be completed post-transcriptionally using a Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme to generate the “Cap 0” structure: m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.). Cap 1 structure may be generated using both Vaccinia Virus Capping Enzyme and a 2′-O methyl-transferase to generate: m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G-2′-β-methyl. Cap 2 structure may be generated from the Cap 1 structure followed by the 2′-β-methylation of the 5′-antepenultimate nucleotide using a 2′-O methyl-transferase. Cap 3 structure may be generated from the Cap 2 structure followed by the 2′-O-methylation of the 5′-preantepenultimate nucleotide using a 2′-O methyl-transferase. Enzymes are preferably derived from a recombinant source. When transfected into mammalian cells, the modified mRNAs have a stability of between 12-18 hours or more than 18 hours, e.g., 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 or greater than 72 hours. Example 7 Capping A. Protein Expression Assay Synthetic mRNAs encoding human G-CSF (cDNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 5; mRNA sequence fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 with a polyA tail approximately 160 nucleotides in length not shown in sequence) containing the ARCA (3′ O-Me-m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G) cap analog or the Cap1 structure can be transfected into human primary keratinocytes at equal concentrations. 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours post-transfection the amount of G-CSF secreted into the culture medium can be assayed by ELISA. Synthetic mRNAs that secrete higher levels of G-CSF into the medium would correspond to a synthetic mRNA with a higher translationally-competent Cap structure. B. Purity Analysis Synthesis Synthetic mRNAs encoding human G-CSF (cDNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 5; mRNA sequence fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 with a polyA tail approximately 160 nucleotides in length not shown in sequence) containing the ARCA cap analog or the Cap1 structure crude synthesis products can be compared for purity using denaturing Agarose-Urea gel electrophoresis or HPLC analysis. Synthetic mRNAs with a single, consolidated band by electrophoresis correspond to the higher purity product compared to a synthetic mRNA with multiple bands or streaking bands. Synthetic mRNAs with a single HPLC peak would also correspond to a higher purity product. The capping reaction with a higher efficiency would provide a more pure mRNA population. C. Cytokine Analysis Synthetic mRNAs encoding human G-CSF (cDNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 5; mRNA sequence fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 with a polyA tail approximately 160 nucleotides in length not shown in sequence) containing the ARCA cap analog or the Cap1 structure can be transfected into human primary keratinocytes at multiple concentrations. 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours post-transfection the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-beta secreted into the culture medium can be assayed by ELISA. Synthetic mRNAs that secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the medium would correspond to a synthetic mRNA containing an immune-activating cap structure. D. Capping Reaction Efficiency Synthetic mRNAs encoding human G-CSF (cDNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 5; mRNA sequence fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 with a polyA tail approximately 160 nucleotides in length not shown in sequence) containing the ARCA cap analog or the Cap1 structure can be analyzed for capping reaction efficiency by LC-MS after capped mRNA nuclease treatment. Nuclease treatment of capped mRNAs would yield a mixture of free nucleotides and the capped 5′-5-triphosphate cap structure detectable by LC-MS. The amount of capped product on the LC-MS spectra can be expressed as a percent of total mRNA from the reaction and would correspond to capping reaction efficiency. The cap structure with higher capping reaction efficiency would have a higher amount of capped product by LC-MS. Example 8 Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of Modified RNA or RT PCR Products Individual modified RNAs (200-400 ng in a 20 μl volume) or reverse transcribed PCR products (200-400 ng) are loaded into a well on a non-denaturing 1.2% Agarose E-Gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and run for 12-15 minutes according to the manufacturer protocol. Example 9 Formulation of Modified mRNA Using Lipidoids Modified mRNAs (mmRNA) are formulated for in vitro experiments by mixing the mmRNA with the lipidoid at a set ratio prior to addition to cells. In vivo formulation may require the addition of extra ingredients to facilitate circulation throughout the body. To test the ability of these lipidoids to form particles suitable for in vivo work, a standard formulation process used for siRNA-lipidoid formulations was used as a starting point. Initial mmRNA-lipidoid formulations may consist of particles composed of 42% lipidoid, 48% cholesterol and 10% PEG, with further optimization of ratios possible. After formation of the particle, mmRNA is added and allowed to integrate with the complex. The encapsulation efficiency is determined using a standard dye exclusion assays. Materials and Methods for Examples 10-14 A. Lipid Synthesis Six lipids, DLin-DMA, DLin-K-DMA, DLin-KC2-DMA, 98N12-5, C12-200 and DLin-MC3-DMA, were synthesized by methods outlined in the art in order to be formulated with modified RNA. DLin-DMA and precursors were synthesized as described in Heyes et. al, J. Control Release, 2005, 107, 276-287. DLin-K-DMA and DLin-KC2-DMA and precursors were synthesized as described in Semple et. al, Nature Biotechnology, 2010, 28, 172-176. 98N12-5 and precursor were synthesized as described in Akinc et. al, Nature Biotechnology, 2008, 26, 561-569. C12-200 and precursors were synthesized according to the method outlined in Love et. al, PNAS, 2010, 107, 1864-1869. 2-epoxydodecane (5.10 g, 27.7 mmol, 8.2 eq) was added to a vial containing Amine 200 (0.723 g, 3.36 mmol, 1 eq) and a stirring bar. The vial was sealed and warmed to 80° C. The reaction was stirred for 4 days at 80° C. Then the mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography using a gradient from pure dichloromethane (DCM) to DCM:MeOH 98:2. The target compound was further purified by RP-HPLC to afford the desired compound. DLin-MC3-DMA and precursors were synthesized according to procedures described in WO 2010054401 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. A mixture of dilinoleyl methanol (1.5 g, 2.8 mmol, 1 eq), N,N-dimethylaminobutyric acid (1.5 g, 2.8 mmol, 1 eq), DIPEA (0.73 mL, 4.2 mmol, 1.5 eq) and TBTU(1.35 g, 4.2 mmol, 1.5 eq) in 10 mL of DMF was stirred for 10 h at room temperature. Then the reaction mixture was diluted in ether and washed with water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtrated and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography using a gradient DCM to DCM:MeOH 98:2. Subsequently the target compound was subjected to an additional RP-HPLC purification which was done using a YMC—Pack C4 column to afford the target compound. B. Formulation of Modified RNA Nanoparticles Solutions of synthesized lipid, 1,2-distearoyl-3-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Ala.), cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), and α-[3′-(1,2-dimyristoyl-3-propanoxy)-carboxamide-propyl]-ω-methoxy-polyoxyethylene (PEG-c-DOMG) (NOF, Bouwelven, Belgium) were prepared at concentrations of 50 mM in ethanol and stored at −20° C. The lipids were combined to yield molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (Lipid:DSPC:Cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG) and diluted with ethanol to a final lipid concentration of 25 mM. Solutions of modified mRNA at a concentration of 1-2 mg/mL in water were diluted in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at a pH of 3 to form a stock modified mRNA solution. Formulations of the lipid and modified mRNA were prepared by combining the synthesized lipid solution with the modified mRNA solution at total lipid to modified mRNA weight ratio of 10:1, 15:1, 20:1 and 30:1. The lipid ethanolic solution was rapidly injected into aqueous modified mRNA solution to afford a suspension containing 33% ethanol. The solutions were injected either manually (MI) or by the aid of a syringe pump (SP) (Harvard Pump 33 Dual Syringe Pump Harvard Apparatus Holliston, Mass.). To remove the ethanol and to achieve the buffer exchange, the formulations were dialyzed twice against phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 at volumes 200-times of the primary product using a Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Rockford, Ill.) with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 10 kD. The first dialysis was carried at room temperature for 3 hours and then the formulations were dialyzed overnight at 4° C. The resulting nanoparticle suspension was filtered through 0.2 μm sterile filter (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) into glass vials and sealed with a crimp closure. C. Characterization of Formulations A Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) was used to determine the particle size, the polydispersity index (PDI) and the zeta potential of the modified mRNA nanoparticles in 1×PBS in determining particle size and 15 mM PBS in determining zeta potential. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy was used to determine the concentration of modified mRNA nanoparticle formulation. 100 μL of the diluted formulation in 1×PBS was added to 900 μL of a 4:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol and chloroform. After mixing, the absorbance spectrum of the solution was recorded between 230 nm and 330 nm on a DU 800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, Calif.). The modified RNA concentration in the nanoparticle formulation was calculated based on the extinction coefficient of the modified RNA used in the formulation and on the difference between the absorbance at a wavelength of 260 nm and the baseline value at a wavelength of 330 nm. QUANT-IT™ RIBOGREEN® RNA assay (Invitrogen Corporation Carlsbad, Calif.) was used to evaluate the encapsulation of modified RNA by the nanoparticle. The samples were diluted to a concentration of approximately 5 μg/mL in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). 50 μL of the diluted samples were transferred to a polystyrene 96 well plate, then either 50 μL of TE buffer or 50 μL of a 2% Triton X-100 solution was added. The plate was incubated at a temperature of 37° C. for 15 minutes. The RIBOGREEN® reagent was diluted 1:100 in TE buffer, 100 μL of this solution was added to each well. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Wallac Victor 1420 Multilablel Counter; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) at an excitation wavelength of ˜480 nm and an emission wavelength of ˜520 nm. The fluorescence values of the reagent blank were subtracted from that of each of the samples and the percentage of free modified RNA was determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity of the intact sample (without addition of Triton X-100) by the fluorescence value of the disrupted sample (caused by the addition of Triton X-100). D. In Vitro Incubation Human embryonic kidney epithelial (HEK293) and hepatocellular carcinoma epithelial (HepG2) cells (LGC standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany) were seeded on 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-one GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and plates for HEK293 cells were precoated with collagen type 1. HEK293 were seeded at a density of 30,000 and HepG2 were seeded at a density of 35,000 cells per well in 100 μl cell culture medium. For HEK293 the cell culture medium was DMEM, 10% FCS, adding 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM Sodiumpyruvate and 1× non-essential amino acids (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) and 1.2 mg/ml Sodiumbicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and for HepG2 the culture medium was MEM (Gibco Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany), 10% FCS adding 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM Sodiumpyruvate and 1× non-essential amino acids (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany. Formulations containing mCherry mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 7; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1); were added in quadruplicates directly after seeding the cells and incubated. The mCherry cDNA with the T7 promoter, 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and 3′ UTR used in in vitro transcription (IVT) is given in SEQ ID NO: 8. The mCherry mRNA was modified with 5meC at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site. Cells were harvested by transferring the culture media supernatants to a 96-well Pro-Bind U-bottom plate (Beckton Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were trypsinized with ½ volume Trypsin/EDTA (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany), pooled with respective supernatants and fixed by adding one volume PBS/2% FCS (both Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany)/0.5% formaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples then were submitted to a flow cytometer measurement with a 532 nm excitation laser and the 610/20 filter for PE-Texas Red in a LSRII cytometer (Beckton Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of all events and the standard deviation of four independent wells are presented in for samples analyzed. Example 10 Purification of Nanoparticle Formulations Nanoparticle formulations of DLin-KC2-DMA and 98N12-5 in HEK293 and HepG2 were tested to determine if the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was dependent on the lipid to modified RNA ratio and/or purification. Three formulations of DLin-KC2-DMA and two formulations of 98N12-5 were produced using a syringe pump to the specifications described in Table 5. Purified samples were purified by SEPHADEX™ G-25 DNA grade (GE Healthcare, Sweden). Each formulation before and after purification (aP) was tested at concentration of 250 ng modified RNA per well in a 24 well plate. The percentage of cells that are positive for the marker for FL4 channel (% FL4-positive) when analyzed by the flow cytometer for each formulation and the background sample and the MFI of the marker for the FL4 channel for each formulation and the background sample are shown in Table 6. The formulations which had been purified had a slightly higher MFI than those formulations tested before purification.

The formulations tested are outlined in Table 7. To determine the optimal concentration of nanoparticle formulations of 98N12-5, varying concentrations of formulated modified RNA (100 ng, 10 ng, 1.0 ng, 0.1 ng and 0.01 ng per well) were tested in a 24-well plate of HEK293, and the results of the FL4 MFI of each dose are shown in Table 8. Likewise, to determine the optimal concentration of nanoparticle formulations of DLin-KC2-DMA, varying concentrations of formulated modified RNA (250 ng 100 ng, 10 ng, 1.0 ng, 0.1 ng and 0.01 ng per well) were tested in a 24-well plate of HEK293, and the results of the FL4 MFI of each dose are shown in Table 9. Nanoparticle formulations of DLin-KC2-DMA were also tested at varying concentrations of formulated modified RNA (250 ng, 100 ng and 30 ng per well) in a 24 well plate of HEK293, and the results of the FL4 MFI of each dose are shown in Table 10. A dose of 1 ng/well for 98N12-5 and a dose of 10 ng/well for DLin-KC2-DMA were found to resemble the FL4 MFI of the background. To determine how close the concentrations resembled the background, we utilized a flow cytometer with optimized filter sets for detection of mCherry expression, and were able to obtain results with increased sensitivity relative to background levels. Doses of 25 ng/well, 0.25 ng/well, 0.025 ng/well and 0.0025 ng/well were analyzed for 98N12-5 (NPA-005) and DLin-KC2-DMA (NPA-003) to determine the MFI of mCherry. As shown in Table 11, the concentration of 0.025 ng/well and lesser concentrations are similar to the background MFI level of mCherry which is about 386.125.

The modified mRNA administered to the rodents is selected from G-CSF (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1), erythropoietin (EPO) (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1), Factor IX (mRNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) or mCherry (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 7; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1). The erythropoietin cDNA with the T7 promoter, 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and 3′ UTR used in in vitro transcription (IVT) is given in SEQ ID NO: 11 and SEQ ID NO: 12. Each formulation also contains a lipid which is selected from one of DLin-DMA, DLin-K-DMA, DLin-KC2-DMA, 98N12-5, C12-200, DLin-MC3-DMA, reLNP, ATUPLEX®, DACC, and DBTC. The rodents are injected with 100 ug, 10 ug or 1 ug of the formulated modified mRNA and samples are collected at specified time intervals. Serum from the rodents administered formulations containing human G-CSF modified mRNA are measured by specific G-CSF ELISA and serum from mice administered human factor IX modified RNA is analyzed by specific factor IX ELISA or chromogenic assay. The liver and spleen from the mice administered with mCherry modified mRNA are analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). As a control, a group of mice are not injected with any formulation and their serum and tissue are collected analyzed by ELISA, FACS and/or IHC. A. Time Course The rodents are administered formulations containing at least one modified mRNA to study the time course of protein expression for the administered formulation. The rodents are bled at specified time intervals prior to and after administration of the modified mRNA formulations to determine protein expression and complete blood count. Samples are also collected from the site of administration of rodents administered modified mRNA formulations subcutaneously and intramuscularly to determine the protein expression in the tissue. B. Dose Response The rodents are administered formulations containing at least one modified mRNA to determine dose response of each formulation. The rodents are bled at specified time intervals prior to and after administration of the modified mRNA formulations to determine protein expression and complete blood count. The rodents are also scarified to analyze the effect of the modified mRNA formulation on the internal tissue. Samples are also collected from the site of administration of rodents administered modified mRNA formulations subcutaneously and intramuscularly to determine the protein expression in the tissue. C. Toxicity The rodents are administered formulations containing at least one modified mRNA to study toxicity of each formulation. The rodents are bled at specified time intervals prior to and after administration of the modified mRNA formulations to determine protein expression and complete blood count. The rodents are also sacrificed to analyze the effect of the modified mRNA formulation on the internal tissue. Samples are also collected from the site of administration of rodents administered modified mRNA formulations subcutaneously and intramuscularly to determine the protein expression in the tissue. Example 15 PLGA Microsphere Formulations Optimization of parameters used in the formulation of PLGA microspheres may allow for tunable release rates and high encapsulation efficiencies while maintaining the integrity of the modified RNA encapsulated in the microspheres. Parameters such as, but not limited to, particle size, recovery rates and encapsulation efficiency may be optimized to achieve the optimal formulation. A. Synthesis of PLGA Microspheres Polylacticglycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres were synthesized using the water/oil/water double emulsification methods known in the art using PLGA (Lactel, Cat# B6010-2, inherent viscosity 0.55-0.75, 50:50 LA:GA), polyvinylalcohol (PVA) (Sigma, Cat#348406-25G, MW 13-23k) dichloromethane and water. Briefly, 0.1 ml of water (W1) was added to 2 ml of PLGA dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (O1) at concentrations ranging from 50-200 mg/ml of PLGA. The W1/O1 emulsion was homogenized (IKA Ultra-Turrax Homogenizer, T18) for 30 seconds at speed 4 (˜15,000 rpm). The W1/O1 emulsion was then added to 100 to 200 ml of 0.3 to 1% PVA (W2) and homogenized for 1 minute at varied speeds. Formulations were left to stir for 3 hours and then washed by centrifugation (20-25 min, 4,000 rpm, 4° C.). The supernatant was discarded and the PLGA pellets were resuspended in 5-10 ml of water, which was repeated 2×. Average particle size (represents 20-30 particles) for each formulation was determined by microscopy after washing. Table 19 shows that an increase in the PLGA concentration led to larger sized microspheres. A PLGA concentration of 200 mg/mL gave an average particle size of 14.8 μm, 100 mg/mL was 8.7 μm, and 50 mg/mL of PLGA gave an average particle size of 4.0 μm. TABLE 19 Varied PLGA Concentration PLGA PVA O1 Concen- W2 Concen- Average Volume tration Volume tration Size Sample ID (mL) (mg/mL) (mL) (%) Speed (μm) 1 2 200 100 0.3 5 14.8 2 2 100 100 0.3 5 8.7 3 2 50 100 0.3 5 4.0 Table 20 shows that decreasing the homogenization speed from 5 (˜20,000 rpm) to speed 4 (˜15,000 rpm) led to an increase in particle size from 14.8 μm to 29.7 μm.

Altering the PVA concentration from 0.3 to 1 wt % had little impact on PLGA microsphere size.

Encapsulation of Modified mRNA Modified G-CSF mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 2 mg/ml (W3). Three batches of PLGA microsphere formulations were made as described above with the following parameters: 0.1 ml of W3 at 2 mg/ml, 1.6 ml of O1 at 200 mg/ml, 160 ml of W2 at 1%, and homogenized at a speed of 4 for the first emulsion (W3/O1) and homogenized at a speed of 5 for the second emulsion (W3/O1/W2). After washing by centrifugation, the formulations were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized for 3 days. To test the encapsulation efficiency of the formulations, the lyophilized material was deformulated in DCM for 6 hours followed by an overnight extraction in water. The modified RNA concentration in the samples was then determined by OD260. Encapsulation efficiency was calculated by taking the actual amount of modified RNA and dividing by the starting amount of modified RNA. In the three batches tested, there was an encapsulation efficiency of 59.2, 49.8 and 61.3. C. Integrity of Modified mRNA Encapsulated in PLGA Microspheres Modified Factor IX mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) was dissolved in water at varied concentrations (W4) to vary the weight percent loading in the formulation (mg modified RNA/mg PLGA*100) and to determine encapsulation efficiency. The parameters in Table 22 were used to make four different batches of PLGA microsphere formulations with a homogenization speed of 4 for the first emulsion (W4/O1) and a homogenization speed of 5 for the second emulsion (W4/O1/W2).

Lyophilization was found to not destroy the overall structure of the PLGA microspheres. To increase weight percent loading (wt %) for the PLGA microspheres, increasing amounts of modified RNA were added to the samples. PLGA microspheres were deformulated by adding 1.0 ml of DCM to each tube and then shaking the samples for 6 hours. For modified RNA extraction, 0.5 ml of water was added to each sample and the samples were shaken overnight before the concentration of modified RNA in the samples was determined by OD260. To determine the recovery of the extraction process, unformulated Factor IX modified RNA (SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) (deformulation control) was spiked into DCM and was subjected to the deformulation process. Table 23 shows the loading and encapsulation efficiency for the samples. All encapsulation efficiency samples were normalized to the deformulation control.

Release Study of Modified mRNA Encapsulated in PLGA Microspheres PLGA microspheres formulated with Factor IX modified RNA (SEQ ID NO: 10) were deformulated as described above and the integrity of the extracted modified RNA was determined by automated electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Experion). The extracted modified mRNA was compared against unformulated modified mRNA and the deformulation control in order to test the integrity of the encapsulated modified mRNA. As shown in FIG. 3, the majority of modRNA was intact for batch ID A, B, C and D, for the deformulated control (Deform control) and the unformulated control (Unform control). E. Protein Expression of Modified mRNA Encapsulated in PLGA Microspheres PLGA microspheres formulated with Factor IX modified RNA (SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) were deformulated as described above and the protein expression of the extracted modified RNA was determined by an in vitro transfection assay. HEK293 cells were reverse transfected with 250 ng of Factor IX modified RNA complexed with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in triplicate. Factor IX modified RNA was diluted in nuclease-free water to a concentration of 25 ng/μl and RNAiMAX was diluted 13.3× in serum-free EMEM. Equal volumes of diluted modified RNA and diluted RNAiMAX were mixed together and were allowed to stand for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, 20 μl of the transfection mix containing 250 ng of Factor IX modified RNA was added to 80 μl of a cell suspension containing 30,000 cells. Cells were then incubated for 16 h in a humidified 37° C./5% CO2 cell culture incubator before harvesting the cell culture supernatant. Factor IX protein expression in the cell supernatant was analyzed by an ELISA kit specific for Factor IX (Molecular Innovations, Cat # HFIXKT-TOT) and the protein expression is shown in Table 24. In all PLGA microsphere batches tested, Factor IX modified RNA remained active and expressed Factor IX protein after formulation in PLGA microspheres and subsequent deformulation.

Release Study of Modified mRNA Encapsulated in PLGA Microspheres PLGA micropsheres formulated with Factor IX modified RNA (SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) were resuspended in water to a PLGA microsphere concentration of 24 mg/ml. After resuspension, 150 ul of the PLGA microsphere suspension was aliquoted into eppendorf tubes. Samples were kept incubating and shaking at 37° C. during the course of the study. Triplicate samples were pulled at 0.2, 1, 2, 8, 14, and 21 days. To determine the amount of modified RNA released from the PLGA microspheres, samples were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the modified RNA concentration in the supernatant was determined by OD 260. The percent release, shown in Table 25, was calculated based on the total amount of modified RNA in each sample. After 31 days, 96% of the Factor IX modified RNA was released from the PLGA microsphere formulations.

Particle Size Reproducibility of PLGA Microspheres Three batches of Factor IX modified RNA (SEQ ID NO: 10 polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) PLGA microspheres were made using the same conditions described for Batch D, shown in Table 22, (0.4 ml of W4 at 4 mg/ml, 2.0 ml of O1 at 200 mg/ml, 200 ml of W2 at 1%, and homogenized at a speed of 5 for the W4/O1/W2 emulsion). To improve the homogeneity of the PLGA microsphere suspension, filtration was incorporated prior to centrifugation. After stirring for 3 hours and before centrifuging, all formulated material was passed through a 100 μm nylon mesh strainer (Fisherbrand Cell Strainer, Cat #22-363-549) to remove larger aggregates. After washing and resuspension with water, 100-200 μl of a PLGA microspheres sample was used to measure particle size of the formulations by laser diffraction (Malvern Mastersizer2000). The particle size of the samples is shown in Table 26. TABLE 26 Particle Size Summary Volume Weighted ID D10 (μm) D50 (μm) D90 (μm) Mean (um) Filtration Control 19.2 62.5 722.4 223.1 No A 9.8 31.6 65.5 35.2 Yes B 10.5 32.3 66.9 36.1 Yes C 10.8 35.7 79.8 41.4 Yes Results of the 3 PLGA microsphere batches using filtration were compared to a PLGA microsphere batch made under the same conditions without filtration. The inclusion of a filtration step before washing reduced the mean particle size and demonstrated a consistent particle size distribution between 3 PLGA microsphere batches. H. Serum Stability of Factor IX PLGA Microspheres Factor IX mRNA RNA (SEQ ID NO: 10 polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) in buffer (TE) or 90% serum (Se), or Factor IX mRNA in PLGA in buffer, 90% serum or 1% serum was incubated in buffer, 90% serum or 1% serum at an mRNA concentration of 50 ng/ul in a total volume of 70 ul. The samples were removed at 0, 30, 60 or 120 minutes. RNases were inactivated with proteinase K digestion for 20 minutes at 55° C. by adding 25 ul of 4× proteinase K buffer (0.4 ml 1M TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 ml 0.5M EDTA, 0.12 ml 5M NaCl, and 0.4 ml 10% SDS) and 8 ul of proteinase K at 20 mg/ml. The Factor IX mRNA was precipitated (add 250 ul 95% ethanol for 1 hour, centrifuge for 10 min at 13 k rpm and remove supernatant, add 200 ul 70% ethanol to the pellet, centrifuge again for 5 min at 13 k rpm and remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 70 ul water) or extracted from PLGA microspheres (centrifuge 5 min at 13 k rpm and remove supernatant, wash pellet with 1 ml water, centrifuge 5 min at 13 k rpm and remove supernatant, add 280 ul dichloromethane to the pellet and shake for 15 minutes, add 70 ul water and then shake for 2 hours and remove the aqueous phase) before being analyzed by bioanalyzer. PLGA microspheres protect Factor IX modified mRNA from degradation in 90% and 1% serum over 2 hours. Factor IX modified mRNA completely degrades in 90% serum at the initial time point.

The LNPs were formulated at a 20:1 weight ratio of total lipid to modified mRNA with a final lipid molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (DLin-KC2-DMA:DSPC:Cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG).

Mice were sacrificed at 8 hrs after dosing. Serum was collected by cardiac puncture from mice that were administered with G-CSF or Factor IX modified mRNA formulations. Protein expression was determined by ELISA. There was no significant body weight loss (<5%) in the G-CSF or Factor IX dose groups. Protein expression for G-CSF or Factor IX dose groups was determined by ELISA from a standard curve. Serum samples were diluted (about 20-2500× for G-CSF and about 10-250× for Factor IX) to ensure samples were within the linear range of the standard curve. As shown in Table 28, G-CSF protein expression determined by ELISA was approximately 17, 1200, and 4700 ng/ml for the 1, 10, and 100 ug dose groups, respectively. As shown in Table 29, Factor IX protein expression determined by ELISA was approximately 36, 380, and 3000-11000 ng/ml for the 1, 10, and 100 ug dose groups, respectively.

The LNPs were formulated at a 20:1 weight ratio of total lipid to modified mRNA with a final lipid molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (DLin-KC2-DMA:DSPC:Cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG).

As shown in Table 32, EPO protein expression in the rats intravenously administered modified EPO mRNA was detectable out to 5 days. G-CSF in the rats intravenously administered modified G-CSF mRNA was detectable to 7 days. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of EPO modified mRNA was detectable to at least 24 hours and G-CSF modified mRNA was detectable to at least 8 hours.

LNP Formulations in Rats LNP formulations, shown in Table 31 (above), are administered to rats (n=4) intravenously (IV) at a single modified mRNA dose 0.05 mg/kg. There is also a control group of rats (n=4) that are untreated. The rats are bled at 2 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 7 days and 14 days after they were administered with G-CSF or EPO modified mRNA formulations to determine the protein expression. Protein expression of G-CSF and EPO are determined using ELISA. Example 20 Early Time Course Study of LNPs LNP formulations, shown in Table 31 (above), are administered to mammals intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) at a single modified mRNA dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg or 0.005 mg/kg. A control group of mammals are not treated. The mammals are bled at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours and/or 2 hours after they are administered with the modified mRNA LNP formulations to determine protein expression using ELISA. The mammals are also bled to determine the complete blood count such as the granulocyte levels and red blood cell count. Example 21 Non-Human Primate In Vivo Study LNP formulations, shown in Table 31 (above), were administered to non-human primates (NHP) (cynomolgus monkey) (n=2) as a bolus intravenous injection (IV) over approximately 30 seconds using a hypodermic needle, which may be attached to a syringe/abbocath or butterfly if needed. The NHP were administered a single modified mRNA IV dose of 0.05 mg/kg of EPO or G-CSF or 0.005 mg/kg of EPO in a dose volume of 0.5 mL/kg. The NHPs were bled 5-6 days before dosing with the modified mRNA LNP formulations to determine protein expression in the serum and a baseline complete blood count. After administration with the modified mRNA formulation the NHP were bled at 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours to determined protein expression. At 24 and 72 hours after administration the complete blood count of the NHP was also determined. Protein expression of G-CSF and EPO was determined by ELISA. Urine from the NHPs was collected over the course of the entire experiment and analyzed to evaluate clinical safety. Samples were collected from the NHPs after they were administered with G-CSF or EPO modified mRNA formulations to determine protein expression using ELISA. Clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis and cytokines of the non-human primates were also analyzed. As shown in Table 35, EPO protein expression in the NHPs administered 0.05 mg/kg is detectable out to 72 hours and the 0.005 mg/kg dosing of the EPO formulation is detectable out to 48 hours. In Table 35, the “<” means less than a given value. G-CSF protein expression was seen out to 24 hours after administration with the modified mRNA formulation. Preliminarily, there was an increase in granulocytes and reticulocytes levels seen in the NHP after administration with the modified mRNA formulations.

After administration with the EPO modified mRNA formulation the NHP were bled at 8, 24, 48, 72 hours and 7 days to determined protein expression. Samples collected from the NHPs after they were administered with G-CSF or EPO modified mRNA formulations were analyzed by ELISA to determine protein expression. Neutrophil and reticulocyte count was also determined pre-dose, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days and 18 days after administration of the modified G-CSF or EPO formulation. As shown in Table 36, G-CSF protein expression was not detected beyond 72 hours. In Table 36, “<39” refers to a value below the lower limit of detection of 39 pg/ml.

The single modified mRNA dose of 0.05 mg/kg or 0.005 mg/kg was in a dose volume of 0.5 mL/kg. The non-human primates are bled 5-6 days prior to dosing to determine serum protein concentration and a baseline complete blood count. After administration with the modified mRNA formulation the NHP are bled at 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 7 days and 14 days to determined protein expression. Protein expression of G-CSF and EPO is determined by ELISA. At 24 hours, 72 hours, 7 days and 14 days after administration the complete blood count of the NHP is also determined. Urine from the NHPs is collected over the course of the entire experiment and analyzed to evaluate clinical safety. Tissue near the injection site is also collected and analyzed to determine protein expression. Example 24 Modified mRNA Trafficking In order to determine localization and/or trafficking of the modified mRNA, studies may be performed as follows. LNP formulations of siRNA and modified mRNA are formulated according to methods known in the art and/or described herein. The LNP formulations may include at least one modified mRNA which may encode a protein such as G-CSF, EPO, Factor VII, and/or any protein described herein. The formulations may be administered locally into muscle of mammals using intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. The dose of modified mRNA and the size of the LNP may be varied to determine the effect on trafficking in the body of the mammal and/or to assess the impact on a biologic reaction such as, but not limited to, inflammation. The mammal may be bled at different time points to determine the expression of protein encoded by the modified mRNA administered present in the serum and/or to determine the complete blood count in the mammal. For example, modified mRNA encoding Factor VII, expressed in the liver and secreted into the serum, may be administered intramuscularly and/or subcutaneously. Coincident or prior to modified mRNA administration, siRNA is administered to knock out endogenous Factor VII. Factor VII arising from the intramuscular and/or subcutaneous injection of modified mRNA is administered is measured in the blood. Also, the levels of Factor VII is measured in the tissues near the injection site. If Factor VII is expressed in blood then there is trafficking of the modified mRNA. If Factor VII is expressed in tissue and not in the blood than there is only local expression of Factor VII. Example 25 Formulations of Multiple Modified mRNA LNP formulations of modified mRNA are formulated according to methods known in the art and/or described herein. The LNP formulations may include at least one modified mRNA which may encode a protein such as G-CSF, EPO, thrombopoietin and/or any protein described herein or known in the art. The at least one modified mRNA may include 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 modified mRNA molecules. The formulations containing at least one modified mRNA may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously in a single or multiple dosing regimens. Biological samples such as, but not limited to, blood and/or serum may be collected and analyzed at different time points before and/or after administration of the at least one modified mRNA formulation. An expression of a protein in a biological sample of 50-200 pg/ml after the mammal has been administered a formulation containing at least one modified mRNA encoding said protein would be considered biologically effective.

C12-200 was expected to be more toxic but also had a high level of expression over a short period. The cationic lipid DLin-DMA (NPA-073-1 and NPA-074-1) had the lowest expression out of the three cationic lipids tested. DLin-MC3-DMA (NPA-071-1 and NPA-072-1) showed good expression up to day three and was above the background sample out to day 7 for EPO formulations. Example 28 Method of Screening for Protein Expression A. Electrospray Ionization A biological sample which may contain proteins encoded by modified RNA administered to the subject is prepared and analyzed according to the manufacturer protocol for electrospray ionization (ESI) using 1, 2, 3 or 4 mass analyzers. A biologic sample may also be analyzed using a tandem ESI mass spectrometry system. Patterns of protein fragments, or whole proteins, are compared to known controls for a given protein and identity is determined by comparison. B. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization A biological sample which may contain proteins encoded by modified RNA administered to the subject is prepared and analyzed according to the manufacturer protocol for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Patterns of protein fragments, or whole proteins, are compared to known controls for a given protein and identity is determined by comparison. C. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry A biological sample, which may contain proteins encoded by modified RNA, may be treated with a trypsin enzyme to digest the proteins contained within. The resulting peptides are analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The peptides are fragmented in the mass spectrometer to yield diagnostic patterns that can be matched to protein sequence databases via computer algorithms. The digested sample may be diluted to achieve 1 ng or less starting material for a given protein. Biological samples containing a simple buffer background (e.g. water or volatile salts) are amenable to direct in-solution digest; more complex backgrounds (e.g. detergent, non-volatile salts, glycerol) require an additional clean-up step to facilitate the sample analysis. Patterns of protein fragments, or whole proteins, are compared to known controls for a given protein and identity is determined by comparison. Example 29 LNP In Vivo Studies mCherry mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 14; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) was formulated as a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) using the syringe pump method. The LNP was formulated at a 20:1 weight ratio of total lipid to modified mRNA with a final lipid molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (DLin-KC2-DMA:DSPC:Cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG). The mCherry formulation, listed in Table 52, was characterized by particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation.

Mice were sacrificed at 24 hrs after dosing. The liver and spleen from the mice administered with mCherry modified mRNA formulations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot, or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Histology of the liver showed uniform mCherry expression throughout the section, while untreated animals did not express mCherry. Western blots were also used to confirm mCherry expression in the treated animals, whereas mCherry was not detected in the untreated animals. Tubulin was used as a control marker and was detected in both treated and untreated mice, indicating that normal protein expression in hepatocytes was unaffected. FACS and IHC were also performed on the spleens of mCherry and untreated mice. All leukocyte cell populations were negative for mCherry expression by FACS analysis. By IHC, there were also no observable differences in the spleen in the spleen between mCherry treated and untreated mice. Example 30 Syringe Pump In Vivo Studies mCherry modified mRNA is formulated as a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) using the syringe pump method. The LNP is formulated at a 20:1 weight ratio of total lipid to modified mRNA with a final lipid molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (DLin-KC2-DMA:DSPC:Cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG). The mCherry formulation is characterized by particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation. The LNP formulation is administered to mice (n=5) intravenously at a modified mRNA dose of 10 or 100 ug. Mice are sacrificed at 24 hrs after dosing. The liver and spleen from the mice administered with mCherry modified mRNA formulations are analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot, and/or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Example 31 In Vitro and In Vivo Expression A. In Vitro Expression in Human Cells Using Lipidoid Formulations The ratio of mmRNA to lipidoid used to test for in vitro transfection is tested empirically at different lipidoid:mmRNA ratios. Previous work using siRNA and lipidoids have utilized 2.5:1, 5:1, 10:1, and 15:1 lipidoid:siRNA wt:wt ratios. Given the longer length of mmRNA relative to siRNA, a lower wt:wt ratio of lipidoid to mmRNA may be effective. In addition, for comparison mmRNA were also formulated using RNAIMAX™ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) or TRANSIT-mRNA (Mirus Bio, Madison, Wis.) cationic lipid delivery vehicles. The ability of lipidoid-formulated Luciferase (IVT cDNA sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site), green fluorescent protein (GFP) (IVT cDNA wild-type sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 17; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 18, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1), G-CSF (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1), and EPO mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) to express the desired protein product can be confirmed by luminescence for luciferase expression, flow cytometry for GFP expression, and by ELISA for G-CSF and Erythropoietin (EPO) secretion. B. In Vivo Expression Following Intravenous Injection Systemic intravenous administration of the formulations are created using various different lipidoids including, but not limited to, 98N12-5, C12-200, and MD1. Lipidoid formulations containing mmRNA are injected intravenously into animals. The expression of the modified mRNA (mmRNA)-encoded proteins are assessed in blood and/or other organs samples such as, but not limited to, the liver and spleen collected from the animal. Conducting single dose intravenous studies will also allow an assessment of the magnitude, dose responsiveness, and longevity of expression of the desired product. In one embodiment, lipidoid based formulations of 98N12-5, C12-200, MD1 and other lipidoids, are used to deliver luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), mCherry fluorescent protein, secreted alkaline phosphatase (sAP), human G-CSF, human Factor IX, or human Erythropoietin (EPO) mmRNA into the animal. After formulating mmRNA with a lipid, as described previously, animals are divided into groups to receive either a saline formulation, or a lipidoid-formulation which contains one of a different mmRNA selected from luciferase, GFP, mCherry, sAP, human G-CSF, human Factor IX, and human EPO. Prior to injection into the animal, mmRNA-containing lipidoid formulations are diluted in PBS. Animals are then administered a single dose of formulated mmRNA ranging from a dose of 10 mg/kg to doses as low as 1 ng/kg, with a preferred range to be 10 mg/kg to 100 ng/kg, where the dose of mmRNA depends on the animal body weight such as a 20 gram mouse receiving a maximum formulation of 0.2 ml (dosing is based no mmRNA per kg body weight). After the administration of the mmRNA-lipidoid formulation, serum, tissues, and/or tissue lysates are obtained and the level of the mmRNA-encoded product is determined at a single and/or a range of time intervals. The ability of lipidoid-formulated Luciferase, GFP, mCherry, sAP, G-CSF, Factor IX, and EPO mmRNA to express the desired protein product is confirmed by luminescence for the expression of Luciferase, flow cytometry for the expression of GFP and mCherry expression, by enzymatic activity for sAP, or by ELISA for the section of G-CSF, Factor IX and/or EPO. Further studies for a multi-dose regimen are also performed to determine the maximal expression of mmRNA, to evaluate the saturability of the mmRNA-driven expression (by giving a control and active mmRNA formulation in parallel or in sequence), and to determine the feasibility of repeat drug administration (by giving mmRNA in doses separated by weeks or months and then determining whether expression level is affected by factors such as immunogenicity). An assessment of the physiological function of proteins such as G-CSF and EPO are also determined through analyzing samples from the animal tested and detecting increases in granulocyte and red blood cell counts, respectively. Activity of an expressed protein product such as Factor IX, in animals can also be assessed through analysis of Factor IX enzymatic activity (such as an activated partial thromboplastin time assay) and effect of clotting times. C. In Vitro Expression Following Intramuscular and/or Subcutaneous Injection The use of lipidoid formulations to deliver oligonucleotides, including mRNA, via an intramuscular route or a subcutaneous route of injection needs to be evaluated as it has not been previously reported. Intramuscular and/or subcutaneous injection of mmRNA are evaluated to determine if mmRNA-containing lipidoid formulations are capable to produce both localized and systemic expression of a desired proteins. Lipidoid formulations of 98N12-5, C12-200, and MD1 containing mmRNA selected from luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), mCherry fluorescent protein, secreted alkaline phosphatase (sAP), human G-CSF, human factor IX, or human Erythropoietin (EPO) mmRNA are injected intramuscularly and/or subcutaneously into animals. The expression of mmRNA-encoded proteins are assessed both within the muscle or subcutaneous tissue and systemically in blood and other organs such as the liver and spleen. Single dose studies allow an assessment of the magnitude, dose responsiveness, and longevity of expression of the desired product. Animals are divided into groups to receive either a saline formulation or a formulation containing modified mRNA. Prior to injection mmRNA-containing lipidoid formulations are diluted in PBS. Animals are administered a single intramuscular dose of formulated mmRNA ranging from 50 mg/kg to doses as low as 1 ng/kg with a preferred range to be 10 mg/kg to 100 ng/kg. A maximum dose for intramuscular administration, for a mouse, is roughly 1 mg mmRNA or as low as 0.02 ng mmRNA for an intramuscular injection into the hind limb of the mouse. For subcutaneous administration, the animals are administered a single subcutaneous dose of formulated mmRNA ranging from 400 mg/kg to doses as low as 1 ng/kg with a preferred range to be 80 mg/kg to 100 ng/kg. A maximum dose for subcutaneous administration, for a mouse, is roughly 8 mg mmRNA or as low as 0.02 ng mmRNA. For a 20 gram mouse the volume of a single intramuscular injection is maximally 0.025 ml and a single subcutaneous injection is maximally 0.2 ml. The optimal dose of mmRNA administered is calculated from the body weight of the animal. At various points in time points following the administration of the mmRNA-lipidoid, serum, tissues, and tissue lysates is obtained and the level of the mmRNA-encoded product is determined. The ability of lipidoid-formulated luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), mCherry fluorescent protein, secreted alkaline phosphatase (sAP), human G-CSF, human factor IX, or human Erythropoietin (EPO) mmRNA to express the desired protein product is confirmed by luminescence for luciferase expression, flow cytometry for GFP and mCherry expression, by enzymatic activity for sAP, and by ELISA for G-CSF, Factor IX and Erythropoietin (EPO) secretion. Additional studies for a multi-dose regimen are also performed to determine the maximal expression using mmRNA, to evaluate the saturability of the mmRNA-driven expression (achieved by giving a control and active mmRNA formulation in parallel or in sequence), and to determine the feasibility of repeat drug administration (by giving mmRNA in doses separated by weeks or months and then determining whether expression level is affected by factors such as immunogenicity). Studies utilizing multiple subcutaneous or intramuscular injection sites at one time point, are also utilized to further increase mmRNA drug exposure and improve protein production. An assessment of the physiological function of proteins, such as GFP, mCherry, sAP, human G-CSF, human factor IX, and human EPO, are determined through analyzing samples from the tested animals and detecting a change in granulocyte and/or red blood cell counts. Activity of an expressed protein product such as Factor IX, in animals can also be assessed through analysis of Factor IX enzymatic activity (such as an activated partial thromboplastin time assay) and effect of clotting times. Example 32 In Vivo Delivery Using Lipoplexes A. Human EPO Modified RNA Lipoplex A formulation containing 100 μg of modified human erythropoietin (EPO) mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) (EPO; fully modified 5-methylcytosine; N1-methylpseudouridine) was lipoplexed with 30% by volume of RNAIMAX™ (Lipoplex-h-Epo-46; Generation 2 or Gen2) in 50-70 uL delivered intramuscularly to four C57/BL6 mice. Other groups consisted of mice receiving an injection of the lipoplexed modified luciferase mRNA (Lipoplex-luc) (IVT cDNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) which served as a control containing 100 μg of modified luciferase mRNA was lipoplexed with 30% by volume of RNAiMAX™ or mice receiving an injection of the formulation buffer as negative control at a dose volume of 65 ul. 13 hours after the intramuscular injection, serum was collected from each mouse to measure the amount of human EPO protein in the mouse serum by human EPO ELISA and the results are shown in Table 53.

Human G-CSF Modified RNA Lipoplex A formulation containing 100 μg of one of two versions of modified human G-CSF mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) (G-CSF fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine (G-CSF) or G-CSF fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methyl-pseudouridine (G-CSF-N1) lipoplexed with 30% by volume of RNAIMAX™ and delivered in 150 uL intramuscularly (I.M), in 150 uL subcutaneously (S.C) and in 225 uL intravenously (I.V) to C57/BL6 mice. Three control groups were administered either 100 μg of modified luciferase mRNA (IVT cDNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) intramuscularly (Luc-unsp I.M.) or 150 μg of modified luciferase mRNA intravenously (Luc-unsp I.V.) or 150 uL of the formulation buffer intramuscularly (Buffer I.M.). 6 hours after administration of a formulation, serum was collected from each mouse to measure the amount of human G-CSF protein in the mouse serum by human G-CSF ELISA and the results are shown in Table 54. These results demonstrate that both 5-methylcytosine/pseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine/N1-methylpseudouridine modified human G-CSF mRNA can result in specific human G-CSF protein expression in serum when delivered via I.V. or I.M. route of administration in a lipoplex formulation.

The results of the human G-CSF protein in mouse serum from the intramuscular administration and the subcutaneous administration results are shown in Table 55. These results demonstrate that 5-methylcytosine/pseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine/N1-methylpseudouridine modified human G-CSF mRNA can result in specific human G-CSF protein expression in serum when delivered via I.M. or S.C. route of administration whether in a saline formulation or in a lipoplex formulation. As shown in Table 55, 5-methylcytosine/N1-methylpseudouridine modified human G-CSF mRNA generally demonstrates increased human G-CSF protein production relative to 5-methylcytosine/pseudouridine modified human G-CSF mRNA.

A formulation buffer is also administered to a control group of mice either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The site of injection on the mice may be collected 17 hours post injection for sectioning to determine the cell type(s) responsible for producing protein. Intravitreal Administration A formulation containing 10 μg of either modified mCherry mRNA lipoplexed with RNAIMAX™, modified mCherry mRNA in a formulation buffer, modified luciferase mRNA lipoplexed with RNAMAX™, modified luciferase mRNA in a formulation buffer can be administered by intravitreal injection (IVT) in rats in a dose volume of 5 μl/eye. A formulation buffer is also administered by IVT to a control group of rats in a dose volume of 5 μl/eye. Eyes from treated rats can be collected after 18 hours post injection for sectioning and lysating to determine whether mmRNA can be effectively delivered in vivo to the eye and result in protein production, and to also determine the cell type(s) responsible for producing protein in vivo. Intranasal Administration A formulation containing 100 μg of either modified mCherry mRNA lipoplexed with 30% by volume of RNAIMAX™, modified mCherry mRNA in saline, modified luciferase mRNA lipoplexed with 30% by volume of RNAIMAX™ or modified luciferase mRNA in saline is delivered intranasally. A formulation buffer is also administered to a control group intranasally. Lungs may be collected about 13 hours post instillation for sectioning (for those receiving mCherry mRNA) or homogenization (for those receiving luciferase mRNA). These samples will be used to determine whether mmRNA can be effectively delivered in vivo to the lungs and result in protein production, and to also determine the cell type(s) responsible for producing protein in vivo. Example 33 In Vivo Delivery Using Varying Lipid Ratios Modified mRNA was delivered to C57/BL6 mice to evaluate varying lipid ratios and the resulting protein expression. Formulations of 100 μg modified human EPO mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) lipoplexed with 10%, 30% or 50% RNAIMAX™, 100 μg modified luciferase mRNA (IVT cDNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) lipoplexed with 10%, 30% or 50% RNAIMAX™ or a formulation buffer were administered intramuscularly to mice in a single 70 μl dose. Serum was collected 13 hours post injection to undergo a human EPO ELISA to determine the human EPO protein level in each mouse. The results of the human EPO ELISA, shown in Table 56, show that modified human EPO expressed in the muscle is secreted into the serum for each of the different percentage of RNAIMAX™.

Rats were intramuscularly injected with 50 μl of the modified human EPO mRNA (h-EPO), modified luciferase mRNA (Luc) (IVT cDNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) or the formulation buffer (F.Buffer) as described in the dosing chart Table 57. Mice were intramuscularly or subcutaneously injected with 50 μl of the modified human EPO mRNA (h-EPO), modified luciferase mRNA (Luc) or the formulation buffer (F.Buffer) as described in the dosing chart Table 58. 13 hours post injection blood was collected and serum was analyzed to determine the amount human EPO for each mouse or rat.

Rats were intramuscularly injected with 50 μl of the modified human EPO mRNA (h-EPO), modified luciferase mRNA (IVT cDNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) (Luc) or the formulation buffer (F.Buffer) as described in the dosing chart Table 59. The rats were bled 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after the intramuscular injection to determine the concentration of human EPO in serum at a given time.

Studies utilizing multiple subcutaneous or intramuscular injection sites at one time point were designed and performed to investigate ways to increase mmRNA drug exposure and improve protein production. In addition to detection of the expressed protein product, an assessment of the physiological function of proteins was also determined through analyzing samples from the animal tested. Surprisingly, it has been determined that split dosing of mmRNA produces greater protein production and phenotypic responses than those produced by single unit dosing or multi-dosing schemes. The design of a split dose experiment involved using human erythropoietin (EPO) mmRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) or luciferase mmRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) administered in buffer alone or formulated with 30% lipoplex (RNAIMAX™). The dosing vehicle (formulation buffer) consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM Na+-phosphate (1.4 mM monobasic sodium phosphate; 0.6 mM dibasic sodium phosphate), and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. The pH was adjusted using sodium hydroxide and the final solution was filter sterilized. The mmRNA was modified with 5meC at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site. mice per group were dosed intramuscularly (I.M.), intravenously (I.V.) or subcutaneously (S.C.) by the dosing chart outlined in Table 60. Serum was collected 13 hours post injection from all mice, tissue was collected from the site of injection from the intramuscular and subcutaneous group and the spleen, liver and kidneys were collected from the intravenous group. The results from the intramuscular group and the subcutaneous group results are shown in Table 61.

Formulation of Modified RNA reLNPs Solutions of synthesized lipid, 1,2-distearoyl-3-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Ala.), cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), and α-[3′-(1,2-dimyristoyl-3-propanoxy)-carboxamide-propyl]-ω-methoxy-polyoxyethylene (PEG-c-DOMG) (NOF, Bouwelven, Belgium) are prepared and stored at −20° C. The synthesized lipid is selected from DLin-DMA with an internal ester, DLin-DMA with a terminal ester, DLin-MC3-DMA-internal ester, and DLin-MC3-DMA with a terminal ester. The reLNPs are combined to yield a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 (reLNP:DSPC:Cholesterol:PEG-c-DOMG). Formulations of the reLNPs and modified mRNA are prepared by combining the lipid solution with the modified mRNA solution at total lipid to modified mRNA weight ratio of 10:1, 15:1, 20:1 and 30:1. B. Characterization of Formulations A Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) is used to determine the particle size, the polydispersity index (PDI) and the zeta potential of the modified mRNA nanoparticles in 1×PBS in determining particle size and 15 mM PBS in determining zeta potential. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy is used to determine the concentration of modified mRNA nanoparticle formulation. After mixing, the absorbance spectrum of the solution is recorded between 230 nm and 330 nm on a DU 800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, Calif.). The modified RNA concentration in the nanoparticle formulation is calculated based on the extinction coefficient of the modified RNA used in the formulation and on the difference between the absorbance at a wavelength of 260 nm and the baseline value at a wavelength of 330 nm. QUANT-IT™ RIBOGREEN® RNA assay (Invitrogen Corporation Carlsbad, Calif.) is used to evaluate the encapsulation of modified RNA by the nanoparticle. The samples are diluted, transferred to a polystyrene 96 well plate, then either a TE buffer or a 2% Triton X-100 solution is added. The plate is incubated and the RIBOGREEN® reagent is diluted in TE buffer, and of this solution is added to each well. The fluorescence intensity is measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Wallac Victor 1420 Multilablel Counter; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Mass.) The fluorescence values of the reagent blank are subtracted from each of the samples and the percentage of free modified RNA is determined by dividing the fluorescence intensity of the intact sample by the fluorescence value of the disrupted sample. C. In Vitro Incubation Human embryonic kidney epithelial (HEK293) and hepatocellular carcinoma epithelial (HepG2) cells (LGC standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany) are seeded on 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-one GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) and plates for HEK293 cells are precoated with collagen type 1. HEK293 are seeded at a density of about 30,000 and HepG2 are seeded at a density of about 35,000 cells per well in 100 μl cell culture medium. Formulations containing mCherry mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 7; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) are added directly after seeding the cells and incubated. The mCherry cDNA with the T7 promoter, 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and 3′ UTR used in in vitro transcription (IVT) is given in SEQ ID NO: 8. Cells are harvested by transferring the culture media supernatants to a 96-well Pro-Bind U-bottom plate (Beckton Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells are trypsinized with ½ volume Trypsin/EDTA (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany), pooled with respective supernatants and fixed by adding one volume PBS/2% FCS (both Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany)/0.5% formaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples are then submitted to a flow cytometer measurement with an excitation laser and a filter for PE-Texas Red in a LSRII cytometer (Beckton Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of all events and the standard deviation of four independent wells are presented in for samples analyzed. D. In Vivo Formulation Studies Mice are administered intravenously a single dose of a formulation containing a modified mRNA and a reLNP. The modified mRNA administered to the mice is selected from G-CSF (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1), Factor IX (mRNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) or mCherry (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 7; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1). The mice are injected with 100 ug, 10 ug or 1 ug of the formulated modified mRNA and are sacrificed 8 hours after they are administered the formulation. Serum from the mice administered formulations containing human G-CSF modified mRNA are measured by specific G-CSF ELISA and serum from mice administered human Factor IX modified RNA is analyzed by specific factor IX ELISA or chromogenic assay. The liver and spleen from the mice administered with mCherry modified mRNA are analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). As a control, a group of mice are not injected with any formulation and their serum and tissue are collected analyzed by ELISA, FACS and/or IHC. Example 38 In Vitro Transfection of VEGF-A Human vascular endothelial growth factor-isoform A (VEGF-A) modified mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 19; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) was transfected via reverse transfection in Human Keratinocyte cells in 24 multi-well plates. The VEGF-A cDNA with the T7 promoter, 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and 3′ UTR used in in vitro transcription (IVT) is given in SEQ ID NO: 20. Human Keratinocytes cells were grown in EPILIFE® medium with Supplement S7 from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) until they reached a confluence of 50-70%. The cells were transfected with 0, 46.875, 93.75, 187.5, 375, 750, and 1500 ng of modified mRNA (mmRNA) encoding VEGF-A which had been complexed with RNAIMAX™ from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.). The RNA:RNAIMAX™ complex was formed by first incubating the RNA with Supplement-free EPILIFE® media in a 5× volumetric dilution for 10 minutes at room temperature. In a second vial, RNAIMAX™ reagent was incubated with Supplement-free EPILIFE® Media in a 10× volumetric dilution for 10 minutes at room temperature. The RNA vial was then mixed with the RNAIMAX™ vial and incubated for 20-30 minutes at room temperature before being added to the cells in a drop-wise fashion. The fully optimized mRNA encoding VEGF-A (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 19; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) transfected with the Human Keratinocyte cells included modifications during translation such as natural nucleoside triphosphates (NTP), pseudouridine at each uridine site and 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine site (pseudo-U/5mC), and N1-methyl-pseudouridine at each uridine site and 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine site (N1-methyl-Pseudo-U/5mC). Cells were transfected with the mmRNA encoding VEGF-A and secreted VEGF-A concentration (pg/ml) in the culture medium was measured at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-transfection for each of the concentrations using an ELISA kit from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) following the manufacturers recommended instructions. These data, shown in Table 62, show that modified mRNA encoding VEGF-A is capable of being translated in Human Keratinocyte cells and that VEGF-A is transported out of the cells and released into the extracellular environment.

The results demonstrate that Factor IX protein was elevated in serum as measured 13 hours after administration. In this study, mice (N=5 for Factor IX, N=3 for Luciferase or Buffer controls) were intramuscularly injected with 50 μl of the Factor IX mmRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1), Luciferase (cDNA sequence for IVT shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) or the formulation buffer (F.Buffer) at 2×100 ug/mouse. The mice were bled at 13 hours after the intramuscular injection to determine the concentration of human the polypeptide in serum in pg/mL. The results revealed that administration of Factor IX mmRNA resulted in levels of 1600 pg/mL at 13 hours as compared to less than 100 pg/mL of Factor IX for either Luciferase or buffer control administration. Example 40 Multi-Site Administration Intramuscular and Subcutaneous Human G-CSF modified mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) modified as either Gen1 or Gen2 (5-methylcytosine (5mc) and a pseudouridine (ψ) modification, G-CSF-Gen1; or N1-5-methylcytosine (N1-5mc) and a ψ modification, G-CSF-Gen2) and formulated in formulation buffer were delivered to mice via intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) injection. Injection of four doses or 2×50 ug (two sites) daily for three days (24 hrs interval) was performed. The fourth dose was administered 6 hrs before blood collection and CBC analysis. Controls included Luciferase (cDNA sequence for IVT shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) or the formulation buffer (F.Buffer). The mice were bled at 72 hours after the first mRNA injection (6 hours after the last mRNA dose) to determine the effect of mRNA-encoded human G-CSF on the neutrophil count. The dosing regimen is shown in Table 63 as are the resulting neutrophil counts (thousands/uL). In Table 63, an asterisks (*) indicate statistical significance at p<0.05. For intramuscular administration, the data reveal a four fold increase in neutrophil count above control at day 3 for the Gen1 G-CSF mRNA and a two fold increase for the Gen2 G-CSF mmRNA. For subcutaneous administration, the data reveal a two fold increase in neutrophil count above control at day 3 for the Gen2 G-CSF mRNA. These data demonstrate that both 5-methylcytidine/pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine/N1-methylpseudouridine-modified mRNA can be biologically active, as evidenced by specific increases in blood neutrophil counts.

Neutrophils were measured at days 1, 5 and 8. Controls included non-specific mammalian RNA or the formulation buffer alone (F.Buffer). The mice were bled at days 1, 5 and 8 to determine the effect of mRNA-encoded human G-CSF to increase neutrophil count. The dosing regimen is shown in Table 64 as are the resulting neutrophil counts (thousands/uL; K/uL). For intravenous administration, the data reveal a four to five fold increase in neutrophil count above control at day 5 with G-CSF modified mRNA but not with unmodified G-CSF mRNA or non-specific controls. Blood count returned to baseline four days after the final injection. No other changes in leukocyte populations were observed. In Table 64, an asterisk (*) indicates statistical significance at p<0.001 compared to buffer. These data demonstrate that lipoplex-formulated 5-methylcytidine/pseudouridine-modified mRNA can be biologically active, when delivered through an I.V. route of administration as evidenced by specific increases in blood neutrophil counts. No other cell subsets were significantly altered. Unmodified G-CSF mRNA similarly administered showed no pharmacologic effect on neutrophil counts.

Controls included Luciferase (cDNA sequence for IVT, SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) or the formulation buffer (F.Buffer). The mice were bled at 13 hours after the injection to determine the concentration of the human polypeptide in serum in pg/mL (G-CSF groups measured human G-CSF in mouse serum and EPO groups measured human EPO in mouse serum).

The design of a single multi-dose experiment involved using human erythropoietin (EPO) mmRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) or G-CSF (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) administered in formulation buffer. The dosing vehicle (F. buffer) was used as a control. The EPO and G-CSF mmRNA were modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site. Animals (n=5), Sprague-Dawley rats, were injected IM (intramuscular) for the single unit dose of 100 ug (delivered to one thigh). For multi-dosing 6 doses of 100 ug (delivered to two thighs) were used for both EPO and G-CSF mmRNA. Control dosing involved use of buffer at a single dose. Human EPO blood levels were evaluated 13 hrs post injection. Human EPO protein was measured in rat serum 13 h post I.M. Five groups of rats were treated and evaluated.

These variants included the G-CSF constructs encoding either the wild-type N terminal secretory signal peptide sequence (MAGPATQSPMKLMALQLLLWHSALWTVQEA; SEQ ID NO: 21), no secretory signal peptide sequence, or secretory signal peptide sequences taken from other mRNAs. These included sequences where the wild type GCSF signal peptide sequence was replaced with the signal peptide sequence of either: human α-1-anti trypsin (AAT) (MMPSSVSWGILLLAGLCCLVPVSLA; SEQ ID NO: 22), human Factor IX (FIX) (MQRVNMIMAESPSLITICLLGYLLSAECTVFLDHENANKILNRPKR; SEQ ID NO: 23), human Prolactin (Prolac) (MKGSLLLLLVSNLLLCQSVAP; SEQ ID NO: 24), or human Albumin (Alb) (MKWVTFISLLFLFSSAYSRGVFRR; SEQ ID NO: 25). 250 ng of modified mRNA encoding each G-CSF variant was transfected into HEK293A (293A in the table), mouse myoblast (MM in the table) (C2C12, CRL-1772, ATCC) and rat myoblast (RM in the table) (L6 line, CRL-1458, ATCC) cell lines in a 24 well plate using 1 ul of Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), each well containing 300,000 cells. The supernatants were harvested after 24 hrs and the secreted G-CSF protein was analyzed by ELISA using the Human G-CSF ELISA kit (Life Technologies). The data shown in Table 68 reveal that cells transfected with G-CSF mmRNA encoding the Albumin signal peptide secrete at least 12 fold more G-CSF protein than its wild type counterpart.

For each donor, the blood was pooled and diluted to 70 mL with DPBS (SAFC Bioscience 59331C, lot 071M8408) and split evenly between two 50 mL conical tubes. 10 mL of Ficoll Paque (GE Healthcare 17-5442-03, lot 10074400) was gently dispensed below the blood layer. The tubes were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 minutes with low acceleration and braking. The tubes were removed and the buffy coat PBMC layers were gently transferred to a fresh 50 mL conical and washed with DPBS. The tubes were centrifuged at 1450 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and the PBMC pellets were resuspended and washed in 50 mL of DPBS. The tubes were centrifuged at 1250 rpm for 10 minutes. This wash step was repeated, and the PBMC pellets were resuspended in 19 mL of Optimem I (Gibco 11058, lot 1072088) and counted. The cell suspensions were adjusted to a concentration of 3.0×10^6 cells/mL live cells. These cells were then plated on five 96 well tissue culture treated round bottom plates (Costar 3799) per donor at 50 uL per well. Within 30 minutes, transfection mixtures were added to each well at a volume of 50 uL per well. After 4 hours post transfection, the media was supplemented with 10 uL of Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco 10082, lot 1012368) Transfection Preparation: mmRNA encoding human G-CSF (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) (containing either (1) natural NTPs, (2) 100% substitution with 5-methyl cytidine and pseudouridine, or (3) 100% substitution with 5-methyl cytidine and N1-methyl pseudouridine; mmRNA encoding luciferase (IVT cDNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) (containing either (1) natural NTPs or (2) 100% substitution with 5-methyl cytidine and pseudouridine) and TLR agonist R848 (Invivogen tlr1-r848) were diluted to 38.4 ng/uL in a final volume of 2500 uL Optimem I. Separately, 432 uL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen 11668-027, lot 1070962) was diluted with 13.1 mL Optimem I. In a 96 well plate nine aliquots of 135 uL of each mmRNA, positive control (R-848) or negative control (Optimem I) was added to 135 uL of the diluted Lipofectamine 2000. The plate containing the material to be transfected was incubated for 20 minutes. The transfection mixtures were then transferred to each of the human PBMC plates at 50 uL per well. The plates were then incubated at 37 C. At 2, 4, 8, 20, and 44 hours each plate was removed from the incubator, and the supernatants were frozen. After the last plate was removed, the supernatants were assayed using a human G-CSF ELISA kit (Invitrogen KHC2032) and human IFN-alpha ELISA kit (Thermo Scientific 41105-2). Each condition was done in duplicate. Results: The ability of unmodified and modified mRNA (mmRNAs) to produce the encoded protein was assessed (G-CSF production) over time as was the ability of the mRNA to trigger innate immune recognition as measured by interferon-alpha production. Use of in vitro PBMC cultures is an accepted way to measure the immunostimulatory potential of oligonucleotides (Robbins et al., Oligonucleotides 2009 19:89-102). Results were interpolated against the standard curve of each ELISA plate using a four parameter logistic curve fit. Shown in Tables 69 and 70 are the average from 2 separate PBMC donors of the G-CSF and IFN-alpha production over time as measured by specific ELISA. In the G-CSF ELISA, background signal from the Lipofectamine 2000 untreated condition was subtracted at each timepoint. The data demonstrated specific production of human G-CSF protein by human peripheral blood mononuclear is seen with G-CSF mRNA containing natural NTPs, 100% substitution with 5-methyl cytidine and pseudouridine, or 100% substitution with 5-methyl cytidine and N1-methyl pseudouridine. Production of G-CSF was significantly increased through the use of modified mRNA relative to unmodified mRNA, with the 5-methyl cytidine and N1-methyl pseudouridine containing G-CSF mmRNA showing the highest level of G-CSF production. With regards to innate immune recognition, unmodified mRNA resulted in substantial IFN-alpha production, while the modified mRNA largely prevented interferon-alpha production. G-CSF mRNA fully modified with 5-methyl cytidine and N1-methylpseudouridine did not significantly increase cytokines whereas G-CSF mRNA fully modified with 5-methyl cytidine and pseudouridine induced IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha and IP10. Many other cytokines were not affected by either modification.

Surprisingly, and not previously known, the effects manifested by the chemical modifications can be titrated when the amount of chemical modification is less than 100%. Previously, it was believed that full modification was necessary and sufficient to elicit the beneficial effects of the chemical modifications and that less than 100% modification of an mRNA had little effect. However, it has now been shown that the benefits of chemical modification can be derived using less than complete modification and that the effects are target, concentration and modification dependent. A. Modified RNA Transfected in PBMC 960 ng of G-CSF mRNA modified with 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and pseudouridine (pseudoU) or unmodified G-CSF mRNA was transfected with 0.8 uL of Lipofectamine 2000 into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from three normal blood donors (D1, D2, D3). The G-CSF mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) was completely modified with 5mC and pseudoU (100% modification), not modified with 5mC and pseudoU (0% modification) or was partially modified with 5mC and pseudoU so the mRNA would contain 50% modification, 25% modification, 10% modification, %5 modification, 1% modification or 0.1% modification. A control sample of Luciferase (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified 5meC and pseudoU) was also analyzed for G-CSF expression. For TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha control samples of Lipofectamine-2000, LPS, R-848, Luciferase (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified 5mC and pseudo), and P(I)P(C) were also analyzed. The supernatant was harvested and run by ELISA 22 hours after transfection to determine the protein expression. The expression of G-CSF is shown in Table 71 and the expression of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha is shown in Table 72.

Modified RNA Transfected in HEK293 Human embryonic kidney epithelial (HEK293) cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells per well in 100 ul cell culture medium. 250 ng of modified G-CSF mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) formulated with RNAiMAX™ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was added to a well. The G-CSF was completely modified with 5mC and pseudoU (100% modification), not modified with 5mC and pseudoU (0% modification) or was partially modified with 5mC and pseudoU so the mRNA would contain 75% modification, 50% modification or 25% modification. Control samples (AK 5/2, mCherry (SEQ ID NO: 7; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified 5mC and pseudoU) and untreated) were also analyzed. The half-life of G-CSF mRNA fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine is approximately 8-10 hours. The supernatants were harvested after 16 hours and the secreted G-CSF protein was analyzed by ELISA. Table 73 shows that the amount of chemical modification of G-CSF is titratable when the mRNA is not fully modified.

A formulation buffer used with all delivery methods contained 150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM calcium chloride, 2 mM Na+-phosphate which included 1.4 mM monobasic sodium phosphate and 0.6 mM of dibasic sodium phosphate, and 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was adjusted using sodium hydroxide to reach a final pH of 6.5 before being filtered and sterilized. A 1× concentration was used as the delivery buffer. To create the lipoplexed solution delivered to the mice, in one vial 50 μg of RNA was equilibrated for 10 minutes at room temperature in the delivery buffer and in a second vial 10 μl RNAiMAX™ was equilibrated for 10 minutes at room temperature in the delivery buffer. After equilibrium, the vials were combined and delivery buffer was added to reach a final volume of 100 μl which was then incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Luciferin was administered by intraperitoneal injection (IP) at 150 mg/kg to each mouse prior to imaging during the plateau phase of the luciferin exposure curve which was between 15 and 30 minutes. To create luciferin, 1 g of D-luciferin potassium or sodium salt was dissolved in 66.6 ml of distilled phosphate buffer solution (DPBS), not containing Mg2+ or Ca2+, to make a 15 mg/ml solution. The solution was gently mixed and passed through a 0.2 μm syringe filter, before being purged with nitrogen, aliquoted and frozen at −80° C. while being protected from light as much as possible. The solution was thawed using a waterbath if luciferin was not dissolved, gently mixed and kept on ice on the day of dosing. Whole body images were taken of each mouse 2, 8 and 24 hours after dosing. Tissue images and serum was collected from each mouse 24 hours after dosing. Mice administered doses intravenously had their liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, heart, peri-renal adipose tissue and thymus imaged. Mice administered doses intramuscularly or subcutaneously had their liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, peri-renal adipose tissue, and muscle at the injection site. From the whole body images the bioluminescence was measured in photon per second for each route of administration and dosing regimen. A. Intramuscular Administration Mice were intramuscularly (I.M.) administered either modified luciferase mRNA fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine (Naked-Luc), lipoplexed modified luciferase mRNA fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine (Lipoplex-luc) (IVT cDNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16, polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence, 5′cap, Cap1, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site), lipoplexed modified granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) (Lipoplex-Cytokine) or the formation buffer at a single dose of 50 μg of modified RNA in an injection volume of 50 μl for each formulation in the right hind limb and a single dose of 5 μg of modified RNA in an injection volume of 50 μl in the left hind limb. The bioluminescence average for the luciferase expression signals for each group at 2, 8 and 24 hours after dosing are shown in Table 74. The bioluminescence showed a positive signal at the injection site of the 5 μg and 50 μg modified RNA formulations containing and not containing lipoplex. TABLE 74 In vivo Biophotoic Imaging (I.M.

In addition to detection of the expressed protein product, an assessment of the physiological function of proteins was also determined through analyzing samples from the animal tested. Surprisingly, it has been determined that split dosing of mmRNA produces greater protein production and phenotypic responses than those produced by single unit dosing or multi-dosing schemes. The design of a single unit dose, multi-dose and split dose experiment involved using human erythropoietin (EPO) modified mRNA (mRNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 9; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) administered in buffer alone. The dosing vehicle (F. buffer) consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM Nat phosphate (1.4 mM monobasic sodium phosphate; 0.6 mM dibasic sodium phosphate), and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 6.5. The pH was adjusted using sodium hydroxide and the final solution was filter sterilized. The mmRNA was modified with 5meC at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site. Animals (n=5) were injected IM (intramuscular) for the single unit dose of 100 ug. For multi-dosing, two schedules were used, 3 doses of 100 ug and 6 doses of 100 ug. For the split dosing scheme, two schedules were used, 3 doses at 33.3 ug and 6 doses of 16.5 ug mmRNA. Control dosing involved use of buffer only at 6 doses. Control mmRNA involved the use of luciferase mmRNA (IVT cDNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 15; mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified 5meC at each cytosine and pseudouridine replacement at each uridine site) dosed 6 times at 100 ug. Blood and muscle tissue were evaluated 13 hrs post injection. Human EPO protein was measured in mouse serum 13 h post I.M. single, multi- or split dosing of the EPO mmRNA in buffer. Seven groups of mice (n=5 mice per group) were treated and evaluated. The results are shown in Table 77. TABLE 77 Split dose study Avg.

For example for treatment group 2 the value 0.28 or product (EPO) per unit drug (mmRNA) is divided by the single dose product per unit drug of 0.14. The result is 2. Likewise, for treatment group 4, the value 1.1 or product (EPO) per unit drug (mmRNA) is divided by the single dose product per unit drug of 0.14. The result is 7.9. Consequently, the dose splitting factor (DSF) may be used as an indicator of the efficacy of a split dose regimen. For any single administration of a total daily dose, the DSF should be equal to 1. Therefore any DSF greater than this value in a split dose regimen is an indication of increased efficacy. To determine the dose response trends, impact of injection site and impact of injection timing, studies are performed. In these studies, varied doses of 1 ug, 5 ug, 10 ug, 25 ug, 50 ug, and values in between are used to determine dose response outcomes. Split dosing for a 100 ug total dose includes three or six doses of 1.6 ug, 4.2 ug, 8.3 ug, 16.6 ug, or values and total doses equal to administration of the total dose selected. Injection sites are chosen from the limbs or any body surface presenting enough area suitable for injection. This may also include a selection of injection depth to target the dermis (Intradermal), epidermis (Epidermal), subcutaneous tissue (SC) or muscle (IM). Injection angle will vary based on targeted delivery site with injections targeting the intradermal site to be 10-15 degree angles from the plane of the surface of the skin, between 20-45 degrees from the plane of the surface of the skin for subcutaneous injections and angles of between 60-90 degrees for injections substantially into the muscle. Example 49 Quantification in Exosomes The quantity and localization of the mmRNA of the present invention can be determined by measuring the amounts (initial, timecourse, or residual basis) in isolated exosomes. In this study, since the mmRNA are typically codon-optimized and distinct in sequence from endogenous mRNA, the levels of mmRNA are quantitated as compared to endogenous levels of native or wild type mRNA by using the methods of Gibbings, PCT/IB2009/005878, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In these studies, the method is performed by first isolating exosomes or vesicles preferably from a bodily fluid of a patient previously treated with a modified mmRNA of the invention, then measuring, in said exosomes, the modified mmRNA levels by one of mRNA microarray, qRT-PCR, or other means for measuring RNA in the art including by suitable antibody or immunohistochemical methods.

C. Modified mRNA Translation Screen: G-CSF ELISA Keratinocytes are grown in EPILIFE medium with Supplement S7 from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) at a confluence of >70%. One set of keratinocytes were reverse transfected with 300 ng of the chemically modified mRNA (mmRNA) complexed with RNAIMAX™ from Invitrogen. Another set of keratinocytes are forward transfected with 300 ng modified mRNA complexed with RNAIMAX™ from Invitrogen. The modified mRNA: RNAIMAX™ complex is formed by first incubating the RNA with Supplement-free EPILIFE® media in a 5× volumetric dilution for 10 minutes at room temperature. In a second vial, RNAIMAX™ reagent was incubated with Supplement-free EPILIFE® Media in 10× volumetric dilution for 10 minutes at room temperature. The RNA vial was then mixed with the RNAIMAX™ vial and incubated for 20-30 minutes at room temperature before being added to the cells in a drop-wise fashion. Secreted human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) concentration in the culture medium is measured at 18 hours post-transfection for each of the chemically modified mRNA in triplicate. Secretion of Human G-CSF from transfected human keratinocytes is quantified using an ELISA kit from Invitrogen or R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.) following the manufacturers recommended instructions.

The modified mRNA:RNAIMAX™ complex is formed as described. Secreted human G-CSF concentration in the culture medium is measured at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-transfection for each concentration of each modified mRNA in triplicate. Secretion of human G-CSF from transfected human keratinocytes is quantified using an ELISA kit from Invitrogen or R&D Systems following the manufacturers recommended instructions. Example 51 Detection of a Cellular Innate Immune Response to Modified mRNA Using an ELISA Assay An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), Human Interferon-β (IFN-β) and Human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) secreted from in vitro-transfected Human Keratinocyte cells is tested for the detection of a cellular innate immune response. Keratinocytes are grown in EPILIFE® medium with Human Keratinocyte Growth Supplement in the absence of hydrocortisone from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.) at a confluence of >70%. Secreted TNF-α keratinocytes are reverse transfected with 0 ng, 93.75 ng, 187.5 ng, 375 ng, 750 ng, 1500 ng or 3000 ng of the chemically modified mRNA (mmRNA) complexed with RNAIMAX™ from Invitrogen as described in triplicate. Secreted TNF-α in the culture medium is measured 24 hours post-transfection for each of the chemically modified mRNA using an ELISA kit from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer protocols. Secreted IFN-β in the same culture medium is measured 24 hours post-transfection for each of the chemically modified mRNA using an ELISA kit from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer protocols. Secreted human G-CSF concentration in the same culture medium is measured at 24 hours post-transfection for each of the chemically modified mRNA. Secretion of human G-CSF from transfected human keratinocytes is quantified using an ELISA kit from Invitrogen or R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.) following the manufacturers recommended instructions. These data indicate which modified mRNA (mmRNA) are capable eliciting a reduced cellular innate immune response in comparison to natural and other chemically modified polynucleotides or reference compounds by measuring exemplary type 1 cytokines TNF-α and IFN-β. Example 52 Human Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) Modified mRNA-Induced Cell Proliferation Assay Human keratinocytes are grown in EPILIFE® medium with Supplement S7 from Invitrogen at a confluence of >70% in a 24-well collagen-coated TRANSWELL® (Corning, Lowell, Mass.) co-culture tissue culture plate. Keratinocytes are reverse transfected with 750 ng of the indicated chemically modified mRNA (mmRNA) complexed with RNAIMAX from Invitrogen as described in triplicate. The modified mRNA:RNAIMAX complex is formed as described. Keratinocyte media is exchanged 6-8 hours post-transfection. 42-hours post-transfection, the 24-well TRANSWELL® plate insert with a 0.4 μm-pore semi-permeable polyester membrane is placed into the human GCSF modified mRNA-transfected keratinocyte containing culture plate Human myeloblast cells, Kasumi-1 cells or KG-1 (0.2×105 cells), are seeded into the insert well and cell proliferation is quantified 42 hours post-co-culture initiation using the CyQuant Direct Cell Proliferation Assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) in a 100-120 μl volume in a 96-well plate. Modified mRNA-encoding human G-CSF-induced myeloblast cell proliferation is expressed as a percent cell proliferation normalized to untransfected keratinocyte/myeloblast co-culture control wells. Secreted human G-CSF concentration in both the keratinocyte and myeloblast insert co-culture wells is measured at 42 hours post-co-culture initiation for each modified mRNA in duplicate. Secretion of human G-CSF is quantified using an ELISA kit from Invitrogen following the manufacturer recommended instructions. Transfected human G-CSF modified mRNA in human keratinocyte feeder cells and untransfected human myeloblast cells are detected by RT-PCR. Total RNA from sample cells is extracted and lysed using RNEASY® kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) according to the manufacturer instructions. Extracted total RNA is submitted to RT-PCR for specific amplification of modified mRNA-G-CSF using PROTOSCRIPT® M-MuLV Taq RT-PCR kit (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.) according to the manufacturer instructions with human G-CSF-specific primers. RT-PCR products are visualized by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Example 53 Buffer Formulation Studies G-CSF modified mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with N1-pseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine) or Factor IX modified mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with N1-pseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine) in a buffer solution is administered intramuscularly to rats in an injection volume of 50 μl (n=5) at a modified mRNA dose of 200 ug per rat as described in Table 78. The modified mRNA is lyophilized in water for 1-2 days. It is then reconstituted in the buffers listed below to a target concentration of 6 mg/ml. Concentration is determined by OD 260. Samples are diluted to 4 mg/ml in the appropriate buffer before dosing. To precipitate the modified mRNA, 3M sodium acetate, pH 5.5 and pure ethanol are added at 1/10th the total volume and 4 times the total volume of modified mRNA, respectively. The material is placed at −80 C for a minimum of 1 hour. The material is then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4000 rpm, 4 C. The supernatant is removed and the pellet is centrifuged and washed 3× with 75% ethanol. Finally, the pellet is reconstituted with buffer to a target concentration of 6 mg/ml. Concentration is determined by OD 260. Samples are diluted to 4 mg/ml in the appropriate buffer before dosing. All samples are prepared by lyophilization unless noted below.

The G-CSF mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) was completely modified with 5mC and pseudoU (100% modification), not modified with 5mC and pseudoU (0% modification) or was partially modified with 5mC and pseudoU so the mRNA would contain 75% modification, 50% modification or 25% modification. A control sample of Luciferase (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified 5meC and pseudoU) was also analyzed for G-CSF expression. For TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha control samples of Lipofectamine-2000, LPS, R-848, Luciferase (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified 5mC and pseudo), and P(I)P(C) were also analyzed. The supernatant was harvested and run by ELISA 22 hours after transfection to determine the protein expression. The expression of G-CSF is shown in Table 83 and the expression of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha is shown in Table 84. The expression of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha may be a secondary effect from the transfection of the G-CSF mRNA. Tables 83 and 84 show that the amount of chemical modification of G-CSF, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is titratable when the mRNA is not fully modified and the titratable trend is not the same for each target. As mentioned above, using PBMC as an in vitro assay system it is possible to establish a correlation between translation (in this case G-CSF protein production) and cytokine production (in this case exemplified by IFN-alpha protein production). Better protein production is correlated with lower induction of innate immune activation pathway, and the percentage modification of a chemistry can be judged favorably based on this ratio (Table 85). As calculated from Tables 83 and 84 and shown in Table 85, full modification with 5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine shows a much better ratio of protein/cytokine production than without any modification (natural G-CSF mRNA) (100-fold for IFN-alpha and 27-fold for TNF-alpha). Partial modification shows a linear relationship with increasingly less modification resulting in a lower protein/cytokine ratio.

The G-CSF mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) was completely modified with 5mC and pseudoU (100% modification), not modified with 5mC and pseudoU (0% modification) or was partially modified with 5mC and pseudoU so the mRNA would contain 50% modification, 25% modification, 10% modification, %5 modification, 1% modification or 0.1% modification. A control sample of mCherry (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 7; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified 5meC and pseudouridine) and G-CSF fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine (Control G-CSF) was also analyzed for G-CSF expression. For tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) control samples of Lipofectamine-2000, LPS, R-848, Luciferase (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified 5mC and pseudo), and P(I)P(C) were also analyzed. The supernatant was harvested 6 hours and 18 hours after transfection and run by ELISA to determine the protein expression. The expression of G-CSF, IFN-alpha, and TNF-alpha for Donor 1 is shown in Table 86, Donor 2 is shown in Table 87 and Donor 3 is shown in Table 88. Full 100% modification with 5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine resulted in the most protein translation (G-CSF) and the least amount of cytokine produced across all three human PBMC donors. Decreasing amounts of modification results in more cytokine production (IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha), thus further highlighting the importance of fully modification to reduce cytokines and to improve protein translation (as evidenced here by G-CSF production).

Single Transfection Human primary foreskin fibroblasts (BJ fibroblasts) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (catalog #CRL-2522) and grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (ATCC, catalog #30-2003) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37° C., under 5% CO2. BJ fibroblasts were seeded on a 24-well plate at a density of 300,000 cells per well in 0.5 ml of culture medium. 250 ng of modified G-CSF mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 140 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine (Gen1) or fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methylpseudouridine (Gen2) having Cap0, Cap1 or no cap was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, catalog #11668-019), following manufacturer's protocol. Control samples of poly I:C (PIC), Lipofectamine 2000 (Lipo), natural luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) and natural G-CSF mRNA were also transfected. The cells were harvested after 18 hours, the total RNA was isolated and DNASE® treated using the RNeasy micro kit (catalog #74004) following the manufacturer's protocol. 100 ng of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (catalog #4368814) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was then analyzed for the expression of innate immune response genes by quantitative real time PCR using SybrGreen in a Biorad CFX 384 instrument following manufacturer's protocol. Table 89 shows the expression level of innate immune response transcripts relative to house-keeping gene HPRT (hypoxanthine phosphoribosytransferase) and is expressed as fold-induction relative to HPRT. In the table, the panel of standard metrics includes: RIG-I is retinoic acid inducible gene 1, IL6 is interleukin-6, OAS-1 is oligoadenylate synthetase 1, IFNb is interferon-beta, AIM2 is absent in melanoma-2, IFIT-1 is interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1, PKR is protein kinase R, TNFa is tumor necrosis factor alpha and IFNa is interferon alpha.

BJ fibroblasts were seeded on a 24-well plate at a density of 300,000 cells per well in 0.5 ml of culture medium. 250 ng of modified G-CSF mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 140 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) unmodified, fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine (Gen1) or fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methylpseudouridine (Gen2) was transfected daily for 5 days following manufacturer's protocol.

The results are shown in Table 90. Unmodified mRNA showed a cytokine response in interferon-beta (IFN-beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) after one day. mRNA modified with at least pseudouridine showed a cytokine response after 2-3 days whereas mRNA modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methylpseudouridine showed a reduced response after 3-5 days.

Blood is collected at 8 hours after dosing and using ELISA the protein levels of G-CSF and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) is determined by ELISA and are shown in Table 81. As shown in Table 91, unmodified, 5mc/pU, and 5mc/N1pU modified G-CSF mRNA resulted in human G-CSF expression in mouse serum. The uncapped 5mC/N1pU modified G-CSF mRNA showed no human G-CSF expression in serum, highlighting the importance of having a 5′cap structure for protein translation. As expected, no human G-CSF protein was expressed in the R848, 5% sucrose only, and untreated groups. Importantly, significant differences were seen in cytokine production as measured by mouse IFN-alpha in the serum. As expected, unmodified G-CSF mRNA demonstrated a robust cytokine response in vivo (greater than the R848 positive control). The 5mc/pU modified G-CSF mRNA did show a low but detectable cytokine response in vivo, while the 5mc/N1pU modified mRNA showed no detectable IFN-alpha in the serum (and same as vehicle or untreated animals). Also, the response of 5mc/N1pU modified mRNA was the same regardless of whether it was capped or not. These in vivo results reinforce the conclusion that 1) that unmodified mRNA produce a robust innate immune response, 2) that this is reduced, but not abolished, through 100% incorporation of 5mc/pU modification, and 3) that incorporation of 5mc/N1pU modifications results in no detectable cytokine response. Lastly, given that these injections are in 5% sucrose (which has no effect by itself), these result should accurately reflect the immunostimulatory potential of these modifications. From the data it is evident that N1pU modified molecules produce more protein while concomitantly having little or no effect on IFN-alpha expression. It is also evident that capping is required for protein production for this chemical modification. The Protein: Cytokine Ratio of 748 as compared to the PC Ratio for the unmodified mRNA (PC=9) means that this chemical modification is far superior as related to the effects or biological implications associated with IFN-alpha.

Rats were injected with 400 ug in 100 ul of G-CSF mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine (G-CSF Gen1), G-CSF mRNA fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methylpseudouridine (G-CSF Gen2) or Factor IX mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine (Factor IX Gen1) reconstituted from the lyophilized form in 5% sucrose. Blood was collected 8 hours after injection and the G-CSF protein level in serum was measured by ELISA. Table 92 shows the G-CSF protein levels in serum after 8 hours. These results demonstrate that both G-CSF Gen 1 and G-CSF Gen 2 modified mRNA can produce human G-CSF protein in a rat following a single intramuscular injection, and that human G-CSF protein production is improved when using Gen 2 chemistry over Gen 1 chemistry.

After the mRNA had been stored for 0 hours, 2 hours, 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 5 days and 14 days, the mRNA was analyzed by gel electrophoresis using a Bio-Rad EXPERION™ system. The modified, unmodified and lipoplexed G-CSF mRNA was also stored in RNASTABLE® (Biomatrica, Inc. San Diego, Calif.) at 40° C. or water at −80° C. or 40° C. for 35 days before being analyzed by gel electrophoresis. All mRNA samples without stabilizer were stable after 2 weeks after storage at 4° C. or −20° C. Modified G-CSF mRNA, with or without lipoplex, was more stable than unmodified G-CSF when stored at 25° C. (stable out to 5 days versus 48 hours), 37° C. (stable out to 24 hours versus 6 hours) and 50° C. (stable out to 6 hours versus 2 hours). Unmodified G-CSF mRNA, modified G-CSF mRNA with or without lipoplex tolerated 12 freeze/thaw cycles. mRNA samples stored in stabilizer at 40° C. showed similar stability to the mRNA samples stored in water at −80° C. after 35 days whereas the mRNA stored in water at 40° C. showed heavy degradation after 18 days. mRNA samples stored at 4° C., 25° C. and 37° C. were stored in 1×TE buffer or the formulation buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM calcium chloride, 2 mM phosphate, 0.5 mM EDTA at a pH of 6.5). The mRNA stored at 4° C. was stable to at least 60 days in both the TE and formulation buffer. At 25° C. the mRNA in formulation buffer was stable out to 14 days and the TE buffer was stable out to at least 6 days. Storage of mRNA in the formulation buffer at 37° C. was stable to 6 days compared to the TE buffer which was stable only until 4 days.

Luciferase mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine is formulated in DLin-MC3-DMA and administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously to rodents at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.005 mg/kg and/or 0.0005 mg/kg. The DLin-MC3-DMA formulations are analyzed prior to administration to determine the mean size and zeta potential. The rodents are imaged at 2 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 144 hours and 168 hours after dosing and the bioluminescence is measured in photon per second for each route of administration and formulation. Example 63 Expression of PLGA Formulated mRNA A. Synthesis and Characterization of Luciferase PLGA Microspheres Luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 140 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methyl pseudouridine, modified with 25% of uridine replaced with 2-thiouridine and 25% of cytosine replaced with 5-methylcytosine, fully modified with N1-methyl pseudouridine, or fully modified with pseudouridine was reconstituted in 1×TE buffer and then formulated in PLGA microspheres. PLGA microspheres were synthesized using the water/oil/water double emulsification methods known in the art using PLGA-ester cap (Lactel, Cat#B6010-2, inherent viscosity 0.55-0.75, 50:50 LA:GA), polyvinylalcohol (PVA) (Sigma, Cat#348406-25G, MW 13-23 k) dichloromethane and water. Briefly, 0.4 ml of mRNA in TE buffer at 4 mg/ml (W1) was added to 2 ml of PLGA dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (O1) at a concentration of 200 mg/ml of PLGA. The W1/O1 emulsion was homogenized (IKA Ultra-Turrax Homogenizer, T18) for 30 seconds at speed 5 (˜19,000 rpm). The W1/O1 emulsion was then added to 250 ml 1% PVA (W2) and homogenized for 1 minute at speed 5 (˜19,000 rpm). Formulations were left to stir for 3 hours, then passed through a 100 μm nylon mesh strainer (Fisherbrand Cell Strainer, Cat #22-363-549) to remove larger aggregates, and finally washed by centrifugation (10 min, 9,250 rpm, 4° C.). The supernatant was discarded and the PLGA pellets were resuspended in 5-10 ml of water, which was repeated 2×. After washing and resuspension with water, 100-200 μl of a PLGA microspheres sample was used to measure particle size of the formulations by laser diffraction (Malvern Mastersizer2000). The washed formulations were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized for 2-3 days. After lyophilization, ˜10 mg of PLGA MS were weighed out in 2 ml eppendorf tubes and deformulated by adding 1 ml of DCM and letting the samples shake for 2-6 hrs. The mRNA was extracted from the deformulated PLGA micropsheres by adding 0.5 ml of water and shaking the sample overnight. Unformulated luciferase mRNA in TE buffer (unformulated control) was spiked into DCM and went through the deformulation process (deformulation control) to be used as controls in the transfection assay. The encapsulation efficiency, weight percent loading and particle size are shown in Table 93. Encapsulation efficiency was calculated as mg of mRNA from deformulation of PLGA microspheres divided by the initial amount of mRNA added to the formulation. Weight percent loading in the formulation was calculated as mg of mRNA from deformulation of PLGA microspheres divided by the initial amount of PLGA added to the formulation.

Protein Expression of Modified mRNA Encapsulated in PLGA Microspheres The day before transfection, 20,000 HeLa cells (ATCC no. CCL-2; Manassas, Va.) were harvested by treatment with Trypsin-EDTA solution (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) and seeded in a total volume of 100 ul EMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FCS and 1× Glutamax) per well in a 96-well cell culture plate (Corning, Manassas, Va.). The cells were grown at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight. The next day, 83 ng of the deformulated luciferase mRNA PLGA microsphere samples, deformulated luciferase mRNA control (Deform control), or unformulated luciferase mRNA control (Unfomul control) was diluted in a 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.). Lipofectamine 2000 (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) was used as a transfection reagent and 0.2 ul was diluted in a 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, both solutions were combined and incubated an additional 15 min at room temperature. Then 20 ul of the combined solution was added to 100 ul of cell culture medium containing the HeLa cells. The plates were then incubated as described before. After a 18 to 22 hour incubation, cells expressing luciferase were lysed with 100 ul Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to manufacturer instructions. Aliquots of the lysates were transferred to white opaque polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning, Manassas, Va.) and combined with 100 ul complete luciferase assay solution (Promega, Madison, Wis.). The background signal of the plates without reagent was about 200 relative light units per well. The plate reader was a BioTek Synergy H1 (BioTek, Winooski, Vt.). Cells were harvested and the bioluminescence (in relative light units, RLU) for each sample is shown in Table 94. Transfection of these samples confirmed that the varied chemistries of luciferase mRNA is still able to express luciferase protein after PLGA microsphere formulation.

Serum-Free Media Human Factor IX mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 10; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) was transfected in serum-free media. The cell culture supernatant was collected and subjected to trypsin digestion before undergoing 2-dimensional HPLC separation of the peptides. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization was used to detect the peptides. 8 peptides were detected and 7 of the detected peptides are unique to Factor IX. These results indicate that the mRNA transfected in the serum-free media was able to express full-length Factor IX protein. B. Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293A Cells 250 ng of codon optimized Human Factor IX mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 10; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) was transfected into HEK 293A cells (150,000 cells/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 in DMEM in presence of 10% FBS. The transfection complexes were removed 3 hours after transfection. Cells were harvested at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after transfection. Total RNA was isolated and used for cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was subjected to analysis by quantitative Real-Time PCR using codon optimized Factor IX specific primer set. Human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransfersase 1 (HPRT) level was used for normalization. The data is plotted as a percent of detectable mRNA considering the mRNA level as 100% at the 3 hour time point. The half-life of Factor IX modified mRNA fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells is about 8-10 hours. Example 65 Saline Formulation Subcutaneous Administration Human G-CSF modified mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) and human EPO modified mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 9; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine), were formulated in saline and delivered to mice via intramuscular (IM) injection at a dose of 100 ug. Controls included Luciferase (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine)) or the formulation buffer (F.Buffer). The mice were bled at 13 hours after the injection to determine the concentration of the human polypeptide in serum in pg/mL. (G-CSF groups measured human G-CSF in mouse serum and EPO groups measured human EPO in mouse serum). The data are shown in Table 95. mRNA degrades rapidly in serum in the absence of formulation suggesting the best method to deliver mRNA to last longer in the system is by formulating the mRNA. As shown in Table 95, mRNA can be delivered subcutaneously using only a buffer formulation.

On the day prior to administration gentamicin ophthalmic ointment or solution was applied to both eyes twice. The gentamicin ophthalmic ointment or solution was also applied immediately following the injection and on the day following the injection. Prior to dosing, mydriatic drops (1% tropicamide and/or 2.5% phenylephrine) are applied to each eye. 18 hours post dosing the eyes receiving the dose of mCherry and delivery buffer are enucleated and each eye was separately placed in a tube containing 10 mL 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for overnight tissue fixation. The following day, eyes will be separately transferred to tubes containing 10 mL of 30% sucrose and stored at 21° C. until they were processed and sectioned. The slides prepared from different sections were evaluated under F-microscopy. Positive expression was seen in the slides prepared with the eyes administered mCherry modified mRNA and the control showed no expression. Example 68 In Vivo Cytokine Expression Study Mice were injected intramuscularly with 200 ug of G-CSF modified mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence) which was unmodified with a 5′cap, Cap1 (unmodified), fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine and a 5′cap, Cap1 (Gen1) or fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methylpseudouridine and a 5′cap, Cap1 (Gen2 cap) or no cap (Gen2 uncapped). Controls of R-848, 5% sucrose and untreated mice were also analyzed. After 8 hours serum was collected from the mice and analyzed for interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) expression.

The protein expression was detected by ELISA and the protein (pg/ml) is shown in Table 100.

CCL-2; Manassas, Va.) were harvested by treatment with Trypsin-EDTA solution (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) and seeded in a total volume of 100 ul EMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FCS and 1× Glutamax) per well in a 96-well cell culture plate (Corning, Manassas, Va.). The cells were grown at 37° C. in 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight. Next day, 37.5 ng or 75 ng of Green Fluorescent protein (GFP) modified RNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 18; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) with the chemical modification described in Table 101, were diluted in 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.). Lipofectamine 2000 (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) was used as transfection reagent and 0.2 ul were diluted in 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM. After 5 minutes of incubation at room temperature, both solutions were combined and incubated an additional 15 minute at room temperature. Then the 20 ul combined solution was added to the 100 ul cell culture medium containing the HeLa cells and incubated at room temperature. After a 18 to 22 hour incubation cells expressing luciferase were lysed with 100 ul of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to manufacturer instructions. Aliquots of the lysates were transferred to white opaque polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning, Manassas, Va.) and combined with 100 ul complete luciferase assay solution (Promega, Madison, Wis.). The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined for each chemistry and is shown in Table 101. These results demonstrate that GFP fully modified with N1-methylpseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine produces more protein in HeLa cells compared to the other chemistry. Additionally the higher dose of GFP administered to the cells resulted in the highest MFI value.

Conclusions From the analysis of the rats 7 days after administration with the modified mRNA, administration of high doses of mRNA do not result in adverse effects. Doses as high as 30 times the effective dose appear to be safe from this analysis. Histopathology showed only minimal inflammation at the site of injection and the site of injection showed only changes consistent with injection and nothing to suggest dose related issues. Additionally there was no chance in muscle enzymes to suggest there was muscle damage. Example 72 Storage Conditions for Modified RNA A. Organics To evaluate the ability of mRNA to withstand an organic environment, luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) was stored at room temperature in solutions of ethanol, methanol or dichloromethane at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Samples were collected at 1 hour, 6 hours and 1 day. The sample was diluted with water to 200 ng/ul and incubated overnight at room temperature in a fume hood to evaporate off the organic solvent. Control samples were completed in parallel with mRNA in water (Water control, organic). The mRNA was stable at room temperature for 1 day in each of the three solutions as determined by running samples on a bioanalyzer. B. Aqueous Solvent Luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with pseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine) was added to 3 different buffers and water to evaluate the effect of aqueous solvents on mRNA stability. mRNA was added to citrate buffer (pH3, 100 mM citric acid), phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4, 6.7 mM phosphate and 154 mM sodium chloride), TE buffer (pH 8, 10 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) or water (pH 5.5, water for injection (WFI)) at 1 mg/ml. Samples were collected at 1 hour, 6 hours and 1 day and diluted with water to a concentration of 200 ng/ul. Control samples were completed in parallel with mRNA in water (Water control, aqueous). The incubation of mRNA in the PBS buffer, TE buffer and water did not affect the mRNA integrity after 1 day. Samples incubated in citrate were not detectable by bioanalyzer. In additional studies to evaluate the citrate buffer, citrate buffer at a pH of 2, 3 and 4 each having 10 mM citrate and 1 mg/ml of luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with pseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine) were evaluated. At a pH of 2 precipitation was visually detected and mRNA was not detected by bioanalyzer below a pH of 4. When compared against phosphate buffer, mRNA was not detected in samples with low pH and precipitation was visible in phosphate buffer samples having a pH of 2. C. pH In order to study the effects of pH on the stability of mRNA, luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with pseudouridine and 5-methylcytosine) was stored at room temperature in aqueous buffers having a pH of 5.8, 6.5 or 7.2. Samples were collected at 1 hour, 1 day and 1 week after the mRNA was added to the pH sample. After collection the samples were incubated at 1 mg/ml concentration and then diluted to 200 ng/ul with water before freezing and characterizing by bioanalyzer. The mRNA was stable after 1 week of storage at room temperature in the pH range of 5.8-7.2 evaluated. D. Freeze/Thaw and Lyophilization To evaluate the effect of freeze/thaw cycles on mRNA stability, luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) in formulation buffer was subjected to numerous freeze/thaw cycles. mRNA was found to be stable for at least 18 cycles. In addition, luciferase mRNA (mRNA SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) was subjected to 3 rounds of lyophilization to test the stability of the mRNA. mRNA was added to water and samples were collected after each of the 3 rounds of lyophilization. The dried mRNA was diluted with water to reach a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The samples were stored frozen until bioanalyzer characterization at 200 ng/ul. Control samples were completed in parallel with mRNA and water formulations and followed the same freezing and thawing cycles. The mRNA was found to be stable after 3 cycles of lyophilization when analyzed by bioanalyzer characterization at 200 ng/ul. E. Centrifugation To evaluate the effects of centrifugation on mRNA integrity, luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) in water at 1 mg/ml was exposed to 10 cycles of 10 k RPM (13.3 k×g) for 10 minutes at 4° C. mRNA and water samples were stored at 4° C. as a control during centrifugation. After 10 cycles of centrifugation the mRNA was still stable when analyzed by bioanalyzer characterization at 200 ng/ul. F. In Vitro Transfection after Storage The day before transfection, 20,000 HeLa cells (ATCC no. CCL-2; Manassas, Va.) were harvested by treatment with Trypsin-EDTA solution (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) and seeded in a total volume of 100 ul EMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FCS and 1× Glutamax) per well in a 96-well cell culture plate (Corning, Manassas, Va.). The cells were grown at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight. The next day, 250 ng of luciferase mRNA from the formulations of the lyophilized, centrifuged, organic and aqueous solvent samples were diluted in a 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.). Lipofectamine 2000 (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) was used as a transfection reagent and 0.2 ul was diluted in a 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, both solutions were combined and incubated an additional 15 min at room temperature. Then 20 ul of the combined solution was added to 100 ul of cell culture medium containing the HeLa cells. The plates were then incubated as described before. After 18 h to 22 h incubation, cells expressing luciferase were lysed with 100 ul Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to manufacturer instructions. Aliquots of the lysates were transferred to white opaque polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning, Manassas, Va.) and combined with 100 ul complete luciferase assay solution (Promega, Madison, Wis.). The background signal of the plates without reagent was about 200 relative light units per well. The plate reader was a BioTek Synergy H1 (BioTek, Winooski, Vt.). Controls of mock transfection (transfection reagent alone), luciferase mRNA control in water, and untreated were also evaluated. Cells were harvested and the bioluminescence average (in relative light units, RLU) for each signal is shown in Table 109. Transfection of these samples confirmed that lyophilization, centrifugation, organic solvents and aqueous solvents except citrate buffer did not impact the activity of luciferase mRNA. Citrate buffer showed a reduced activity after transfection.

The mRNA solutions were prepared in water, 1× TE buffer at 4 mg/ml as indicated in Table 110, and added to either dichloromethane (DCM) or DCM containing 200 mg/ml of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) (Lactel, Cat#B6010-2, inherent viscosity 0.55-0.75, 50:50 LA:GA) to achieve a final mRNA concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. The solutions requiring homogenization were homogenized for 30 seconds at speed 5 (approximately 19,000 rpm) (IKA Ultra-Turrax Homogenizer, T18). The mRNA samples in water, dichloromethane and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were not recoverable (NR). All samples, except the NR samples, maintained integrity of the mRNA as determined by bioanalyzer (Bio-rad Experion). The day before transfection, 20,000 HeLa cells (ATCC no. CCL-2; Manassas, Va.) were harvested by treatment with Trypsin-EDTA solution (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) and seeded in a total volume of 100 ul EMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FCS and 1× Glutamax) per well in a 96-well cell culture plate (Corning, Manassas, Va.). The cells were grown at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight. The next day, 250 ng of luciferase mRNA from the recoverable samples was diluted in a 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.). Lipofectamine 2000 (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) was used as a transfection reagent and 0.2 ul was diluted in a 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM. After 5 minutes of incubation at room temperature, both solutions were combined and incubated an additional 15 minutes at room temperature. Then 20 ul of the combined solution was added to 100 ul of cell culture medium containing the HeLa cells. The plates were then incubated as described before. Controls luciferase mRNA (luciferase mRNA formulated in saline) (Control) and untreated cells (Untreat.) were also evaluated. Cells were harvested and the bioluminescence average (in photons/second) (biolum. (p/s)) for each signal is also shown in Table 110. The recoverable samples all showed activity of luciferase mRNA when analyzed. After 18 to 22 hour incubation, cells expressing luciferase were lysed with 100 ul Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to manufacturer instructions. Aliquots of the lysates were transferred to white opaque polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning, Manassas, Va.) and combined with 100 ul complete luciferase assay solution (Promega, Madison, Wis.).

PLGA microspheres were synthesized using the water/oil/water double emulsification methods known in the art using PLGA (Lactel, Cat# B6010-2, inherent viscosity 0.55-0.75, 50:50 LA:GA), polyvinylalcohol (PVA) (Sigma, Cat#348406-25G, MW 13-23 k) dichloromethane and water. Briefly, 0.2 to 0.6 ml of mRNA in water or TE buffer at a concentration of 2 to 6 mg/ml (W1) was added to 2 ml of PLGA dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (O1) at a concentration of 100 mg/ml of PLGA. The W1/O1 emulsion was homogenized (IKA Ultra-Turrax Homogenizer, T18) for 30 seconds at speed 5 (˜19,000 rpm). The W1/O1 emulsion was then added to 250 ml 1% PVA (W2) and homogenized for 1 minute at speed 5 (˜19,000 rpm). Formulations were left to stir for 3 hours, then passed through a 100 μm nylon mesh strainer (Fisherbrand Cell Strainer, Cat #22-363-549) to remove larger aggregates, and finally washed by centrifugation (10 min, 9,250 rpm, 4° C.). The supernatant was discarded and the PLGA pellets were resuspended in 5-10 ml of water, which was repeated 2×. The washed formulations were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized for 2-3 days. After lyophilization, ˜10 mg of PLGA MS were weighed out in 2 ml eppendorf tubes and deformulated by adding 1 ml of DCM and letting the samples shake for 2-6 hrs. mRNA was extracted from the deformulated PLGA micropsheres by adding 0.5 ml of water and shaking the sample overnight. Unformulated luciferase mRNA in water or TE buffer (deformulation controls) was spiked into DCM and went through the deformulation process to be used as controls in the transfection assay. The day before transfection, 20,000 HeLa cells (ATCC no. CCL-2; Manassas, Va.) were harvested by treatment with Trypsin-EDTA solution (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) and seeded in a total volume of 100 ul EMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FCS and 1× Glutamax) per well in a 96-well cell culture plate (Corning, Manassas, Va.). The cells were grown at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight. The next day, 100 ng of the deformulated luciferase mRNA samples was diluted in a 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.). Lipofectamine 2000 (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) was used as a transfection reagent and 0.2 ul was diluted in a 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM. After 5 minutes of incubation at room temperature, both solutions were combined and incubated an additional 15 minutes at room temperature. Then 20 ul of the combined solution was added to 100 ul of cell culture medium containing the HeLa cells. The plates were then incubated as described before. After 18 to 22 hour incubation, cells expressing luciferase were lysed with 100 ul Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to manufacturer instructions. Aliquots of the lysates were transferred to white opaque polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning, Manassas, Va.) and combined with 100 ul complete luciferase assay solution (Promega, Madison, Wis.). The background signal of the plates without reagent was about 200 relative light units per well. The plate reader was a BioTek Synergy H1 (BioTek, Winooski, Vt.). To determine the activity of the luciferase mRNA from each formulation, the relative light units (RLU) for each formulation was divided by the RLU of the appropriate mRNA deformulation control (mRNA in water or TE buffer). Table 111 shows the activity of the luciferase mRNA. The activity of the luciferase mRNA in the PLGA microsphere formulations (Form.) was substantially improved by formulating in TE buffer versus water.

CCL-2; Manassas, Va.) were harvested by treatment with Trypsin-EDTA solution (Life Technologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) and seeded in a total volume of 100 ul EMEM medium (supplemented with 10% FCS and 1× Glutamax) per well in a 96-well cell culture plate (Corning, Manassas, Va.). The cells were grown at 37° C. in 5% CO2 atmosphere overnight. The next day, 83 ng of Luciferase modified RNA (mRNA sequence shown SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 140 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1) with the chemical modification described in Table 112, were diluted in 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.). Lipofectamine 2000 (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, N.Y.) was used as transfection reagent and 0.2 ul were diluted in 10 ul final volume of OPTI-MEM. After 5 minutes of incubation at room temperature, both solutions were combined and incubated an additional 15 minute at room temperature. Then the 20 ul combined solution was added to the 100 ul cell culture medium containing the HeLa cells and incubated at room temperature. After 18 to 22 hours of incubation cells expressing luciferase were lysed with 100 ul of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, Wis.) according to manufacturer instructions. Aliquots of the lysates were transferred to white opaque polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning, Manassas, Va.) and combined with 100 ul complete luciferase assay solution (Promega, Madison, Wis.). The lysate volumes were adjusted or diluted until no more than 2 mio relative light units (RLU) per well were detected for the strongest signal producing samples and the RLUs for each chemistry tested are shown in Table 112. The plate reader was a BioTek Synergy H1 (BioTek, Winooski, Vt.). The background signal of the plates without reagent was about 200 relative light units per well.

The mice were imaged at 2 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours and 144 hours for intramuscular delivery and 2 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours and 120 hours for subcutaneous delivery. Twenty minutes prior to imaging, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a D-luciferin solution at 150 mg/kg. Animals were then anesthetized and images were acquired with an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (Perkin Elmer). Bioluminescence was measured as total flux (photons/second) of the entire mouse. The average total flux (photons/second) for intramuscular administration is shown in Table 113 and the average total flux (photons/second) for subcutaneous administration is shown in Table 114. The background signal was 3.79E+05 (p/s). The peak expression for intramuscular administration was seen between 24 and 48 hours for all chemistry and expression was still detected at 144 hours. For subcutaneous delivery the peak expression was seen at 2-8 hours and expression was detected at 72 hours.

Cupertino, Calif.) is loaded with the 0.2 ml of 1×PBS (pH 7.4) (PBS loaded pump) or 0.2 ml of luciferase modified mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 140 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methylpseudouridine) at 1 mg/ml in 1×PBS (pH 7.4) (Luciferase loaded pump) and incubated overnight in 1×PBS (pH 7.4) at 37° C. Balb-C mice (n=3) are implanted subcutaneously with either the PBS loaded pump or the luciferase loaded pump and imaged at 2 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. As a control a PBS loaded pump is implanted subcutaneously and the mice are injected subcutaneously with luciferase modified mRNA in 1×PBS (PBS loaded pump; SC Luciferase) or an osmotic pump is not implanted and the mice are injected subcutaneously with luciferase modified mRNA in 1×PBS (SC Luciferase).

Using a catheter connected to the external PBS loaded pump or the luciferase loaded pump Balb-C mice (n=3) are administered the formulation. The mice are imaged at 2 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. As a control an external PBS loaded pump is used and the mice are injected subcutaneously with luciferase modified mRNA in 1×PBS (PBS loaded pump; SC Luciferase) or the external pump is not used and the mice are only injected subcutaneously with luciferase modified mRNA in 1×PBS (SC Luciferase). Twenty minutes prior to imaging, mice are injected intraperitoneally with a D-luciferin solution at 150 mg/kg. Animals are then anesthetized and images are acquired with an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (Perkin Elmer). Bioluminescence is measured as total flux (photons/second) of the entire mouse.

Upon mixing, fibrinogen is converted to fibrin to form a fibrin clot in about 10 to 30 seconds. This clot can mimic the natural clotting mechanism of the body. Additionally a fibrin hydrogel is a three dimensional structure that can potentially be used in sustained release delivery. Currently, fibrin sealant is approved for application in hemostasis and sealing to replace conventional surgical techniques such as suture, ligature and cautery. The thrombin and fibrinogen components were loaded separately into a dual barreled syringe. Balb-C mice (n=3) were injected subcutaneously with 50 ul of fibrinogen, 50 ul of thrombin and they were also injected at the same site with modified luciferase mRNA (mRNA sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 140 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and N1-methylpseudouridine) (Tisseel+Luciferase), 50 ul of fibrinogen and 50 ul thrombin (Tisseel) or modified luciferase mRNA (Luciferase). The injection of fibrinogen and thrombin was done simultaneously using the dual-barreled syringe. The subcutaneous injection of luciferase was done 15 minutes after the fibrinogen/thrombin injection to allow the fibrin hydrogel to polymerize (Tisseel+Luciferase group). A control group of untreated mice were also evaluated. The mice were imaged at 5 hours and 24 hours. Twenty minutes prior to imaging, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a D-luciferin solution at 150 mg/kg. Animals were then anesthetized and images were acquired with an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (Perkin Elmer). Bioluminescence was measured as total flux (photons/second) of the entire mouse. The luciferase formulations are outlined in Table 117 and the average total flux (photons/second) is shown in Table 118. The fibrin sealant was found to not interfere with imaging and the injection of luciferase and Tisseel showed expression of luciferase. TABLE 117 Luciferase Formulations Conc Inj.

Synthesis of PLGA Microspheres Polylacticglycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres were synthesized using the water/oil/water double emulsification methods known in the art using PLGA-ester cap (Lactel, Cat#B6010-2, inherent viscosity 0.55-0.75, 50:50 LA:GA) or PLGA-acid cap (Lactel, Cat#B6013-2, inherent viscosity 0.55-0.75, 50:50 LA:GA), polyvinylalcohol (PVA) (Sigma, Cat#348406-25G, MW 13-23 k) dichloromethane and water. Briefly, 0.4 ml of mRNA in water (W1) at 4 mg/ml was added to 2 ml of PLGA dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (O1) at concentrations ranging from 50-200 mg/ml of PLGA. The W1/O1 emulsion was homogenized (IKA Ultra-Turrax Homogenizer, T18) for 30 seconds at speed 4 (˜15,000 rpm). The W1/O1 emulsion was then added to 250 ml of 1% PVA (W2) and homogenized for 1 minute at speed 5 (˜19,000 rpm). Formulations were left to stir for 3 hours, then passed through a 100 μm nylon mesh strainer (Fisherbrand Cell Strainer, Cat #22-363-549) to remove larger aggregates, and finally washed by centrifugation (10 min, 9,250 rpm, 4° C.). The supernatant was discarded and the PLGA pellets were resuspended in 5-10 ml of water, which was repeated 2×. The washed formulations were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized for 2-3 days. B. Decreasing Homogenization Speed or PLGA Concentration PLGA luciferase microspheres (luciferase mRNA shown in SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcysotine and pseudouridine) were made using the conditions described above with ester-capped PLGA. After washing and resuspension with water, 100-200 μl of a PLGA microspheres sample was used to measure particle size of the formulations by laser diffraction (Malvern Mastersizer2000). The particle size of the microspheres made by decreasing homogenization speed during the addition of the first emulsion to the second emulsion with a PLGA concentration of 200 mg/ml is shown in Table 141 and the particle size of the microspheres made by decreasing PLGA concentration in dichloromethane (DCM) is shown in Table 142 with a homogenization speed of 5 during the addition of the first emulsion to the second emulsion.

Release Study of Modified mRNA Encapsulated in PLGA Microspheres PLGA microspheres formulated with Luciferase modified RNA (SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) were deformulated and the integrity of the extracted modified RNA was determined by automated electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Experion). After lyophilization, ˜10 mg of PLGA MS were weighed out in 2 ml eppendorf tubes and deformulated by adding 1 ml of DCM and letting the samples shake for 2-6 hrs. mRNA was extracted from the deformulated PLGA micropsheres by adding 0.5 ml of water and shaking the sample overnight. Unformulated luciferase mRNA in water (Deform control) was spiked into DCM and went through the deformulation process to be used as a control. The extracted modified mRNA was compared against unformulated modified mRNA and the deformulation control in order to test the integrity of the encapsulated modified mRNA. The majority of modified RNA was intact for batch ID A, B, C, D, E, as compared to the deformulated control (Deform control) and the unformulated control (Unform control). D. Release Study of Modified mRNA Encapsulated in PLGA Microspheres PLGA micropsheres formulated with Luciferase modified RNA (SEQ ID NO: 16; polyA tail of approximately 160 nucleotides not shown in sequence; 5′cap, Cap1; fully modified with 5-methylcytosine and pseudouridine) were resuspended in TE buffer to a PLGA microsphere concentration of 80 mg/ml in duplicate or triplicate. After resuspension, samples were kept incubating and shaking at 37° C. during the course of the study. For each time point (0.04, 0.25, 1.2, 4, and 7 days), the tubes were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 0.25 ml of fresh TE buffer. To determine the amount of modified RNA released from the PLGA microspheres, the modified RNA concentration in the supernatant was determined by OD 260. The percent release, shown in Table 144, was calculated based on the total amount of modified RNA in each sample. The release rate of mRNA formulations can be tailored by altering the particle size, the PLGA concentration, and the acid versus ester-end cap.

Example 96 Directed SAR of Pseudouridine and N1-Methyl PseudoUridine With the recent focus on the pyrimidine nucleoside pseudouridine, a series of structure-activity studies were designed to investigate mRNA containing modifications to pseudouridine or N1-methyl-pseudourdine. The study was designed to explore the effect of chain length, increased lipophilicity, presence of ring structures, and alteration of hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions when modifications were made at the N1 position, C6 position, the 2-position, the 4-position and on the phosphate backbone. Stability is also investigated.
