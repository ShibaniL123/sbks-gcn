FLEXIBLE ARTICULATED DEVICE FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates methods and devices for enabling movement of a working end of a laryngeal microsurgical device, BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In laryngoscopy surgical procedures, an elongate shaft of a. surgical device is inserted through the mouth to position a distal end of the shaft at a surgical site. These kind of procedures are usually performed with rigid shafts thai are less suitable to accommodate the tortuous pathway of the body lumen. These tools can be used to engage and or treat tissue in a number of ways to achieve a therapeutic effect. Current laryngoscopy devices do not utilize articulating effectors to provide the user with more control over the orientation of the working end of the instrument. Integration of the controls for articulating, as well as actuating, tend be complicated by the size constraints of the relatively small pathway through which they have to be inserted. Generally, the control motions are all transferred through the shaft as longitudinal translations, which sometimes can interfere with the control of the shaft, A number of articulating medical instruments and methods are known in the art. For example: U.S Pat. No. 8,308,738 describes methods and devices provided for controlling movement of a working end of a surgical device, and in particular for perform ing various surgical procedures using an instrument having an end effector that can be articulated relative to an elongate shaft of the device. In certain embodiments, the end effector can also optionally rotate relative to the elongate shaft of the device, and/or the shaft can rotate relative to a handle of the device. While these instruments are rigid and relatively easy to control, complications arise with current devices purported to be able to be used for multiple actions. Accordingly, there remains a need for improved methods and devices for controlling movement of a working end of a laryngoscopy surgical device.

A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention has application in laryngoscopy procedures. FIGs. la-b illustrates one explanatory embodiment of an insertion portion 1.00 of an either manually and/or mechanically articulating flexible device. The insertion portion 1.00 is preferably configured to be inserted into a patient's body, and it has rigid and flexible portions. As shown, the insertion portion 100 generally comprises a hollow flexible elongate shaft Hi) coupled to a distal end 1.10b thereof by a three-bar linkage/clevis part 130, ending with a working end or end effector 120. While the end effector 120 can have various configurations, in the illustrated embodiment the end effector 120 is in the form of scissors having opposed jaws that are pi.vota.lly coupled to one another. The three-bar linkage/clevis 1.30 allows the end effector .120 to be oriented at an angle relative to a longitudinal axis L of the elongate shaft 1.10. The device is also configured to allow the end effector 120 to rotate relative to and about the longitudinal axis L of the elongate shaft 110. An actuation wire 180 goes through the hollowed coiled shaft, via the clevis, to the end effector. FIG.2 illustrates one detailed, explanatory embodiment. The three-bar linkage is composed by 4 distinct parts pivotally linked to each, other: the coiled shaft 140, the second link 150, the end effector base 160 and the clevis 170. Rotation of the end effector is allowed by the coiled shaft 140, which is accommodated within the elongated flexible hollowed shaft 110. The distal end of the coiled shaft 140 is pivotally coupled to the clevis 1.70. So when the coiled shaft rotates, also the whole end (comprising of the clevis, the three-bar linkage and the end effector) turn as well. Each link can have a variety of configurations, but in an exemplary embodiment the first link is the coiled shaft 140. The second link 150 have a generally elongate shape and the third link. 160 is in the form, of an elongate rod or bar. The coiled shaft 1.40, is coupled in its distal end 140b to an adaptor 1.41. Adaptor 141 is coupled by a pin to a proximal end of the second link 150a. The distal end 150b of the second link 150 is coupled by a pin to a proximal end 160a of the effector base .1 0. The distal end 1.10b of the flexible shaft 110 is coupled to a rotating adaptor 1 1 1. which is successively coupled to the proximal end 170a of the clevis 170. The distal end of the clevis 170b is coupled by a pin to the proximal end 160a of the base of the end effector 160. The actuation wire 180 is accommodated within the coiled shaft .140 into the clevis 170, being separated from the second link 150 by the guide 172 (in FIG.3). From there, the distal end 180b of the actuation wire 180 goes into the end effector 160, in which different types of tools can be configured, as shown in FIGs.la-b 120. The particular location, at which the base of the end effector 160 mates to the second link 150 and the clevis 170, is p votally mated at a location thai will allow the base of the en effector 160 to articulate relative to the coil system 140, This occurs when the coil system 140 is retracted. F G.3 Illustrates the configuration of the clevis 170. In the upper level of the clevis there is a slit 171 in which the second link 150 can move when die coil shaft 140 is being retracted. Before the distal part of the clevis there is a guide 172 that is responsible for separating the zone where the actuation wire passes 174 and the zone where the second link 150 moves. On the distal part of the clevis there axe the slots 173 for the insertion of the connecting pins between the clevis 170 and the effector 160. The guide 172 is configured having, by at least a section of a shape characterized as a concaved -parabolic nozzle-like form. Exemplary diagram 175, is an idealized version of such a nozzle-like form. It is herein acknowledged that the guide section may be configured in variations of the coneaved-parabolic nozzle-like form. The nozzle-like shape is configured for guidance of the actuation wire and facilitates longitudinal motion of the wire but prevents side to side motion of same. FIGA illustrates a possible configuration of the second link 150. Usually, the second link in a three-bar linkage is made of a single, elongated piece, which is pin connected to the other links. The novel configuration of the second link comprises the division of the second link 150 into three distinct parts 150.1. 150.2, 150.3, connected to each other by pins. This configuration enables a higher articulation angle of the end effector when needed. As indicated above, the embodiment disclosed herein for enabling movement of a working end of a surgical device is used in a variety of laryngoscopy surgical procedures. In one exemplary laryngoscopy procedure, a surgical device comprising three-bar-linkage retraction mechanism., in which said mechanism comprises a distal element 160, a link 150 and a flexible elongated shaft 110 provided proximally to the three link bar, wherein the link is interconnected to the shaft, by mean of a rigid clevis 170. Further comprising the device a flexible coiled rotation-enabling shaft 140 that is accommodated within the main flexible shaft 1.10 and part of its distal end is accommodated within the clevis 1.70. An actuation wire 180 accommodated within the coiled shaft 140 extends through the clevis 170, via the guide 172, into a part of the end effector 160. Reference is now made to FIG.5 which is an illustration of the method of operating the device. The method comprises steps of: Articulation a. Retraction of coiled shaft 140, within clevis 170; b. Retraction of adaptor 141 by coiled shaft 140; c. Second link 150 is pulled back by adaptor 141; d. Effector 160 is pulled up by second link 150, enabled by interconnection with clevis 170; Rotation a. Rotation of coiled shaft 140, within main shaft l !0(not shown); b. Rotation of adaptor 141 by coiled shaft 140: c. Second link 150 is rotated by adaptor 141; d. Effector 1.60 is rotated by second link 150; e. Second link 150 rotates clevis 170, which is enabled to rotate by rotating adaptor 1 11 (not shown); Actuation a. Retraction of actuation wire 180 activates the end effector mechanism.; Three degrees of freedom a. Actuation wire 180 is retracted within the coiled shaft 140; b. Actuation wire 180 is guided through the clevis by guide 172; c. Guide 172 avoids interaction between actuation wire 180 and arti c illation mecharn srn Retraction of the coil shaft is translated along a longitudinal axis of the elongate shaft to cause a three-bar linkage to laterally articulate the end effector in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the elongate shaft to allow the end effector to be angularly oriented relative to the elongate shaft. Actuation of the device is achieved by the actuation wire which, thanks to the guide in the clevis, is not affected and does not affect the rotation and articulation. in order to achieve stabilization of the flexible shaft during all the possible actions (rotation,, actuation, articulation) a rigid clevis is positioned at the distal end of the flexible shaft. The actuation wire passes through the clevis via a specific track created by the guide, separating it from the three-bar linkage, when actuation is desired. Also, for the same reason, actuation is not disturbed when articulation is in play. The clevis is connected to the main shaft by a turning adaptor which enables the rotation of the clevis when the coiled shaft is in action. Once the end effector is positioned as desired, the end effector can be used to perform a surgical procedure. in light of the above, the advantages of the new configuration of the present invention include: usage of a flexible shaft that enables three degrees of freedom in an independent matter: rotation, actuation and articulation.
