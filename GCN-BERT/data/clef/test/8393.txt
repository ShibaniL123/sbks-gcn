SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR LOW POWER THERMAL CYCLING BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] Nucleic acid amplification methods permit selected amplification and identification of nucleic acids of interest from a complex mixture, such as a biological sample. Nucleic acid of interest can be amplified via amplification methods known in the art, such as thermal cycling based approaches including polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During or following amplification of the nucleic acid of interest, the products of amplification can be detected and results of the detection interpreted by an end user. Traditional nucleic acid amplification and detection methods typically involve a thermal cycling apparatus that requires a high voltage power input. Real-time PCR techniques involve the use of a detector that can detect a signal from a sample undergoing nucleic acid amplification in real-time. The combined thermal cycling and detection require a degree of power input that limits the use of the thermal cycler. [0002] Point-of-care (POC) testing has the potential to improve the detection and management of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings with poor laboratory infrastructure, or in remote areas where there are delays in the receipt of laboratory results and potential complications to following up with patients. However, many challenges face performing nucleic acid amplification in POC settings. For instance, if a high voltage power input is needed to perform real-time PCR, the thermal cycler will have limited portability. For example, batteries may be quickly drained using such traditional systems. Similarly, the power sources that can be used to power such devices are limited, thus preventing full use of a thermal cycler in different environments and situations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0003] A need exists for improved systems and methods for low power thermal cycling. Such low power thermal cycling may permit thermal cycling apparatuses to be portable and operable in different situations. For example, the thermal cycling apparatuses may be taken out into the field or into portions of the country where regular power sources are not readily available. The use of low voltage power may also permit the thermal cycler to be charged in transit or be charged by power sources that may otherwise not be able to accommodate traditional thermal cycling devices. These features can greatly improve the ability to perform thermal cycling in different point-of-care (POC) settings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0045] While preferable embodiments of the invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. [0046] The invention provides systems and methods for low power thermal cycling. Various aspects of the invention described herein may be applied to any of the particular applications set forth below or for any other types of nucleic acid amplification systems. The invention may be applied as a standalone system or method, or as part of an integrated sample processing system. It shall be understood that different aspects of the invention can be appreciated individually, collectively, or in combination with each other. [0047] A device for conducting nucleic acid amplification may be provided. The device may include a thermal cycler capable of causing one or more samples to undergo multiple thermal cycles. The multiple thermal cycles may cause a nucleic acid of interest to be amplified in the samples, using any thermal cycling based approach (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). The device may also include a detector configured to detect an optical signal from the sample. The detector may detect the signal while the reaction is in progress without removing the sample from the device. The signal may be related to the amount of amplified nucleic acid of interest in the sample. The device may be capable of conducting real-time PCR using the thermal cycler and the detector. [0048] The nucleic acid amplification device may be configured to operate at a low voltage power. For example, the device may be configured to operate with no more than a total of about 12 V of electricity, or any other low voltage value described elsewhere herein. Both the thermal cycler and the detector may be powered using a total of no more than 12 V. The device may have a power connector to connect the device to a power source. In some instances, the power source may be a low power source that provides no more than 12 V of power. Optionally, the power source may be a charging port in a vehicle. The power source may be a vehicle battery that may provide low voltage power to the device. [0049] Optionally, the device may have an energy storage unit, such as a battery pack. The battery pack may be on-board the device or may be connected to the device. The battery pack may be charged using a low voltage power source, such as a 12 V power source. The battery pack may be used to power the device, such as the thermal cycler and the detector of the device, using no more than 12 V, or any other low voltage value. [0050] A portable configuration may be provided for the device. In some instances, the thermal cycler may have a small configuration. For example, the device may be no more than about 12 cm tall. The device may have a length of no more than 16 cm. In some instances, the device may weigh no more than about 2 kg. [0051] The device may be deployed to a user location. This may permit the device to be used in various point-of-care (POC) situations. A vehicle may be used to provide power to a device. Providing power to a device may include directly powering one or more components of the device or charging the device. The device may be charged or powered using a vehicle while the vehicle is in operation. The vehicle is considered in operation so long as its ignition is not completely turned off. In some embodiment, the device may be charged or powered while a vehicle is in transit with the device on-board. The device may be used at the POC location to receive a sample. The device may conduct nucleic acid amplification at the POC location, or while in transit. This may advantageously permit a device to be used at locations that may otherwise not be equipped to permit operation of the device. Thus, nucleic acid amplification results can be achieved much more rapidly by reducing the time it may take a sample to be provided to a device, and to receive the results back from the device. [0052] FIG. 1A shows an example of a device for conducting a nucleic acid amplification reaction in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. A device 100 for conducting nucleic acid amplification may include a thermal cycler 110 and a detector 120. The thermal cycler may be configured to accept a sample 130. [0053] The thermal cycler 110 may be capable of receiving the sample 130 which may comprise a target nucleic acid. The sample may also include an agent that detects amplified target nucleic acid (e.g., a detectable nucleic acid binding agent). The sample may also include other reagents for conducting a nucleic acid amplification. Depending on the nature of the target nucleic acid that is to be amplified, other reagents may include reverse transcriptase for conducting reverse-transcriptase coupled PCT, dNTPs, Mg2+ ion. [0054] The sample 130 may be a biological sample. The biological sample may be taken from a subject. For example, the sample may be taken from a living subject directly. In some embodiments, the biological sample may include breath, blood, urine, feces, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid and sweat. Any suitable biological sample that comprises nucleic acid may be obtained from a subject. A biological sample may be solid matter (e.g., biological tissue) or may be a fluid (e.g., a biological fluid). In general, a biological fluid can include any fluid associated with living organisms. Non- limiting examples of a biological sample include blood (or components of blood - e.g., white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets) obtained from any anatomical location (e.g., tissue, circulatory system, bone marrow) of a subject, cells obtained from any anatomical location of a subject, skin, heart, lung, kidney, breath, bone marrow, stool, semen, vaginal fluid, interstitial fluids derived from tumorous tissue, breast, pancreas, cerebral spinal fluid, tissue, throat swab, biopsy, placental fluid, amniotic fluid, liver, muscle, smooth muscle, bladder, gall bladder, colon, intestine, brain, cavity fluids, sputum, pus, micropiota, meconium, breast milk, prostate, esophagus, thyroid, serum, saliva, urine, gastric and digestive fluid, tears, ocular fluids, sweat, mucus, earwax, oil, glandular secretions, spinal fluid, hair, fingernails, skin cells, plasma, nasal swab or nasopharyngeal wash, spinal fluid, cord blood, emphatic fluids, and/or other excretions or body tissues. [0055] A subject may be a living subject or a dead subject. The subject may be a human or an animal. In some examples, the subject may be mammal. Examples of subjects may include, but are not limited to simians, avines, canines, felines, equines, bovines, ovines, porcines, delphines, rodents (e.g., mice, rats), or insects. [0056] A biological sample may be obtained from a subject by any means known in the art. Non- limiting examples of means to obtain a biological sample directly from a subject include accessing the circulatory system (e.g., intravenously or intra-arterially via a syringe or other needle), collecting a secreted biological sample (e.g., feces, urine, sputum, saliva, etc.), surgically (e.g., biopsy), swabbing (e.g., buccal swab, oropharyngeal swab), pipetting, and breathing. Moreover, a biological sample may be obtained from any anatomical part of a subject where a desired biological sample is located. [0057] A biological sample obtained directly from a subject may generally refer to a biological sample that has not been further processed after being obtained from the subject, with the exception of any means used to collect the biological sample from the subject for further processing. For example, blood is obtained directly from a subject by accessing the subject's circulatory system, removing the blood from the subject (e.g., via a needle), and entering the removed blood into a receptacle. The receptacle may comprise reagents (e.g., anti-coagulants) such that the blood sample is useful for further analysis. In another example, a swab may be used to access epithelial cells on an oropharyngeal surface of the subject. After obtaining the biological sample from the subject, the swab containing the biological sample can be contacted with a fluid (e.g., a buffer) to collect the biological fluid from the swab. Alternatively, pre-processing may occur on the biological sample prior to being provided to the device. [0058] In some embodiments, a biological sample has not been purified when provided in a reaction vessel. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid of a biological sample has not been extracted when the biological sample is provided to a reaction vessel. For example, the RNA or DNA in a biological sample may not be extracted from the biological sample when providing the biological sample to a reaction vessel. Moreover, in some embodiments, a target nucleic acid (e.g., a target RNA or target DNA) present in a biological sample may not be concentrated prior to providing the biological sample to a reaction vessel. Alternatively, dilution or concentration of the sample may occur prior to being provided to a device. [0059] The sample 130 may have a target nucleic acid to be amplified. The target nucleic acid may be amplified to generate an amplified product. A target nucleic acid may be a target RNA or a target DNA. In cases where the target nucleic acid is a target RNA, the target RNA may be any type of RNA. In some embodiments, the target RNA is viral RNA. In some embodiments, the viral RNA may be pathogenic to the subject. Non-limiting examples of pathogenic viral RNA include human immunodeficiency virus I (HIV I), human immunodeficiency virus Π (HIV Π), orthomyxoviruses, influenza viruses (e.g., H1N1, H3N2, H5N1), hepevirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, hepatitis E, hepatitis G, Epstein-Barr virus, mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, SARS, West Nile Fever, polio, and measles. [0060] In cases where the target nucleic acid is a target DNA, the target DNA may be any type of DNA. In some embodiments, the target DNA is viral DNA. In some embodiments, the viral DNA may be pathogenic to the subject. Non-limiting examples of DNA viruses include herpes simplex virus, smallpox, and chickenpox. In some cases, a target DNA may be a bacterial DNA. The bacterial DNA may be from a bacterium pathogenic to the subject such as, for example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis - a bacterium known to cause tuberculosis. [0061] The sample 130 may also include an agent that detects amplified target nucleic acid. The agent may be a reporter agent that can yield a detectable signal whose presence or absence is indicative of the presence of an amplified product. The intensity of the detectable signal may be proportional to the amount of amplified product. For example, the detectable signal may be directly linearly proportional, exponentially proportional, reversely proportional, or have any other type of proportional relationship to the amount of amplified product. In some cases, where amplified product is generated of a different type of nucleic acid than the target nucleic acid initially amplified, the intensity of the detectable signal may be proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid initially amplified. For example, in the case of amplifying a target RNA via parallel reverse transcription and amplification of the DNA obtained from reverse transcription, reagents necessary for both reactions may also comprise a reporter agent may yield a detectable signal that is indicative of the presence of the amplified DNA product and/or the target RNA amplified. The intensity of the detectable signal may be proportional to the amount of the amplified DNA product and/or the original target RNA amplified. The use of a reporter agent also enables real-time amplification methods, including real-time PCR for DNA amplification. [0062] Reporter agents may be linked with nucleic acids, including amplified products, by covalent or non-covalent means. Non-limiting examples of non-covalent means include ionic interactions, Van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, reporter agents may bind to initial reactants and changes in reporter agent levels may be used to detect amplified product. In some embodiments, reporter agents may only be detectable (or non-detectable) as nucleic acid amplification progresses. In some embodiments, an optically-active dye (e.g., a fluorescent dye) may be used as may be used as a reporter agent. An agent for detecting amplified target nucleic acid may be a nucleic acid binding dye. The dye may be a DNA-intercalating dye. Non-limiting examples of dyes include Eva green, SYBR green, SYBR blue, DAPI, propidium iodine, Hoeste, SYBR gold, ethidium bromide, acridines, proflavine, acridine orange, acriflavine, fluorcoumanin, ellipticine, daunomycin, chloroquine, distamycin D, chromomycin, homidium, mithramycin, ruthenium polypyridyls, anthramycin, phenanthridines and acridines, ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, hexidium iodide, dihydroethidium, ethidium homodimer-1 and -2, ethidium monoazide, and ACMA, Hoechst 33258, Hoechst 33342, Hoechst 34580, DAPI, acridine orange, 7-AAD, actinomycin D, LDS751 , hydroxystilbamidine, SYTOX Blue, SYTOX Green, SYTOX Orange, POPO-1, POPO-3, YOYO-1, YOYO-3, TOTO-1, TOTO-3, JOJO-1, LOLO-1 , BOBO-1, BOBO-3, PO-PRO-1, PO-PRO-3, BO-PRO-1, BO-PRO-3, TO-PRO-1 , TO-PRO-3, TO-PRO-5, JO-PRO-1, LO-PRO-1 , YO-PRO-1, YO-PRO-3, PicoGreen, OliGreen, RiboGreen, SYBR Gold, SYBR Green I, SYBR Green II, SYBR DX, SYTO-40, -41 , -42, -43, -44, - 45 (blue), SYTO-13, -16, -24, -21, -23, -12, -11 , -20, -22, -15, -14, -25 (green), SYTO-81, -80, -82, - 83, -84, -85 (orange), SYTO-64, -17, -59, -61 , -62, -60, -63 (red), fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), rhodamine, tetramethyl rhodamine, R-phycoerythrin, Cy-2, Cy-3, Cy-3.5, Cy-5, Cy5.5, , Cy-7, Texas Red, Phar-Red, allophycocyanin (APC), Sybr Green I, Sybr Green Π, Sybr Gold, CellTracker Green, 7-AAD, ethidium homodimer I, ethidium homodimer Π, ethidium homodimer ΠΙ, ethidium bromide, umbelliferone, eosin, green fluorescent protein, erythrosin, coumarin, methyl coumarin, pyrene, malachite green, stilbene, lucifer yellow, cascade blue, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride, fluorescent lanthanide complexes such as those including europium and terbium, carboxy tetrachloro fluorescein, 5 and/or 6-carboxy fluorescein (FAM), 5- (or 6-) iodoacetamidofluorescein, 5-{[2(and 3)-5-(Acetylmercapto)-succinyl]amino} fluorescein (SAMSA-fluorescein), lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride, 5 and/or 6 carboxy rhodamine (ROX), 7-amino-methyl-coumarin, 7- Amino-4-methylcoumarin-3 -acetic acid (AMCA), BODIPY fluorophores, 8-methoxypyrene-l ,3,6- trisulfonic acid trisodium salt, 3,6-Disulfonate-4-amino-naphthalimide, phycobiliproteins, AlexaFluor 350, 405, 430, 488, 532, 546, 555, 568, 594, 610, 633, 635, 647, 660, 680, 700, 750, and 790 dyes, DyLight 350, 405, 488, 550, 594, 633, 650, 680, 755, and 800 dyes, or other fluorophores. [0063] In some instances, a reporter agent may be a sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe that can be optically active when hybridized with an amplified product. Due to sequence-specific binding of the probe to the amplified product, use of oligonucleotide probes can increase specificity and sensitivity of detection. A probe may be linked to any of the optically-active reporter agents (e.g., dyes) described herein and may also include a quencher capable of blocking the optical activity of an associated dye. Non-limiting examples of probes that may be useful used as reporter agents include TaqMan probes, TaqMan Tamara probes, TaqMan MGB probes, or Lion probes. [0064] A reporter agent may be an RNA oliognucleotide probe that may include an optically-active dye (e.g., fluorescent dye) and a quencher positioned adjacently on the probe. The close proximity of the dye with the quencher can block the optical activity of the dye. The probe may bind to a target sequence to be amplified. Upon the breakdown of the probe with the exonuclease activity of a DNA polymerase during amplification, the quencher and dye are separated, and the free dye regains its optical activity that can subsequently be detected. [0065] Optionally, a reporter agent may be a molecular beacon. A molecular beacon may include, for example, a quencher linked at one end of an oligonucleotide in a hairpin conformation. At the other end of the oligonucleotide is an optically active dye, such as, for example, a fluorescent dye. In the hairpin configuration, the optically-active dye and quencher are brought in close enough proximity such that the quencher is capable of blocking the optical activity of the dye. Upon hybridizing with amplified product, however, the oligonucleotide assumes a linear conformation and hybridizes with a target sequence on the amplified product. Linearization of the oligonucleotide results in separation of the optically-active dye and quencher, such that the optical activity is restored and can be detected. The sequence specificity of the molecular beacon for a target sequence on the amplified product can improve specificity and sensitivity of detection. [0066] In some embodiments, a reporter agent may be a radioactive species. Non-limiting examples of radioactive species include 14C, 1231, 1241, 1251, 131I, Tc99m, 35S, or 3H. [0067] In some embodiments, a reporter agent may be an enzyme that is capable of generating a detectable signal. Detectable signal may be produced by activity of the enzyme with its substrate or a particular substrate in the case the enzyme has multiple substrates. Non-limiting examples of enzymes that may be used as reporter agents include alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, P-galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, acetylcholinesterase, and luciferase. [0068] The sample 130 may be provided with reagents necessary for nucleic acid amplification within the device. In some instances, a reagent may comprise one or more of the following: (i) a reverse transcriptase, (ii) a DNA polymerase, and (iii) a primer set for the target nucleic acid (e.g., RNA). Some examples of reagents may include a commercially available pre-mixture (e.g., Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR or One-Step RT-qPCR kit) comprising reverse transcriptases (e.g., Sensiscript and Omniscript transcriptases), a DNA Polymerase (e.g., HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase), and dNTPs. [0069] In some instances, the sample 130 may be provided within a sample container, such as a reaction vessel. Any components of the sample including the target nucleic acid, agent that detects amplified target nucleic acid, and/or reagents for nucleic acid amplification may be provided within the reaction vessel to obtain a reaction mixture. Any suitable reaction vessel may be used. In some embodiments, a reaction vessel comprises a body that can include an interior surface, an exterior surface, an open end, and an opposing closed end. In some embodiments, a reaction vessel may comprise a cap. The cap may be configured to contact the body at its open end, such that when contact is made the open end of the reaction vessel is closed. In some cases, the cap is permanently associated with the reaction vessel such that it remains attached to the reaction vessel in open and closed configurations. In some cases, the cap is removable, such that when the reaction vessel is open, the cap is separated from the reaction vessel. In some embodiments, a reaction vessel may be sealed, optionally hermetically sealed. The reaction vessel may be fluid-tight. [0070] A reaction vessel may be of varied size, shape, weight, and configuration. In some examples, a reaction vessel may be round or oval tubular shaped. In some embodiments, a reaction vessel may be rectangular, square, diamond, circular, elliptical, or triangular shaped. A reaction vessel may be regularly shaped or irregularly shaped. In some embodiments, the closed end of a reaction vessel may have a tapered, rounded, or flat surface. For example, a flat cap, rounded, cap, or tapered cap may be provided.

The reaction vessel may be configured to contain more than any of the values described herein. The reaction vessel may have a volume configured to contain no more than a volume falling into a range between two of the values described herein. [0072] The reaction vessel may be less than or equal to about 15 mm, 21.5 mm, 21.8 mm, or 22 mm tall. The reaction vessel may have a height of less than or equal to about 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, 5mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, 9 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, 13 mm, 14 mm, 15 mm, 16 mm, 17 mm, 18 mm, 19 mm, 20 mm, 21 mm, 22 mm, 23 mm, 24 mm, 25 mm, 27 mm, 30 mm, 35 mm, 40 mm, 45 mm, 50 mm, 55 mm, 60 mm, or 70 mm. The reaction vessel may have a height greater than any of the values described herein. The reaction vessel may have a height falling into a range between any two of the values described herein. [0073] The reaction vessel may have a cross-sectional area of no more than 0.001 mm2, 0.005 mm2, 0.01 mm2, 0.03 mm2, 0.05 mm2, 0.1 mm2, 0.12 mm2, 0.15 mm2, 0.2 mm2, 0.3 mm2, 0.4 mm2, 0.5 mm2, 0.6 mm2, 0.7 mm2, 0.8 mm2, 0.9 mm2, 1 mm2, 1.1 mm2, 1.2 mm2, 1.3 mm2, 1.5 mm2, 1.7 mm2, 2 mm2, 2.2 mm2, 2.5 mm2, 3 mm2, 3.5 mm2, 4 mm2, 4.5 mm2, 5 mm2, 6 mm2, 7 mm2, 8 mm2, 9 mm2, 10 mm2, 12 mm2, 15 mm2, 17 mm2, 20 mm2, 22 mm2, 25 mm2, 30 mm2, 35 mm2, 40 mm2, or 50 mm2. The reaction vessel may have a cross -sectional area less than any of the values described herein. The reaction vessel may have a cross-sectional area falling into a range between any two of the values described herein. [0074] Reaction vessels may be constructed of any suitable material with non-limiting examples of such materials that include glasses, metals, plastics, and combinations thereof. Reaction vessels can be made from optically transparent or translucent materials that may permit an optical signal from within the reaction vessel to leave the reaction vessel. The reaction vessels may be made from a material that may or may not filter an optical signal exiting the reaction vessel. In some instances, the reaction vessels may be formed from a clear material that may permit a detector to view the interior of the reaction vessels. In some instances, the interior of the reaction vessels may be imaged. Alternatively, an amount of optical signal exiting the reaction vessel may be detected and measured. [0075] A thermal cycler may be capable of receiving a reaction vessel. The reaction vessels may be removably provided to the thermal cycler. The reaction vessels may be inserted within a device or taken out of the device. The reaction vessels may be placed onto a supporting component of the thermal cycler or taken off the supporting component. [0076] In alternative embodiments, the sample may be loaded directly into the device without requiring a separate reaction vessel. In some instances, reaction vessels or receptacles may be directly built-into the device. [0077] The thermal cycler 110 may accept the reaction vessel having the sample therein, or may directly receive the sample. The thermal cycler may be capable of alternatingly heating and cooling the sample. Multiple cycles of heating and cooling may be provided. Any temperature profile may be provided for the various heating and cooling cycles. [0078] The thermal cycler may utilize conduction, convection, and/or radiation to heat and/or cool the samples. In one example, a heating block may be provided that may directly contact the sample, or may contact a sample container that contains the sample. In some instances, electricity may be used to resistively heat a heating/cooling system of the thermal cycler. Other techniques, such as induction heating may be used to control the heating/cooling system of the thermal cycler. In some instances Peltier devices may be used to heat or cool the samples in the thermal cycler. [0079] Any type of nucleic acid amplification reaction known in the art may be used to amplify a target nucleic acid and generate an amplified product. Moreover, amplification of a nucleic acid may linear, exponential, or a combination thereof. Amplification may be emulsion based or may be non-emulsion based. Non-limiting examples of nucleic acid amplification methods include reverse transcription, primer extension, polymerase chain reaction, ligase chain reaction, helicase-dependent amplification, asymmetric amplification, rolling circle amplification, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA). In some embodiments, the amplified product may be DNA. In cases where a target RNA is amplified, DNA can be obtained by reverse transcription of the RNA and subsequent amplification of the DNA can be used to generate an amplified DNA product. The amplified DNA product may be indicative of the presence of the target RNA in the biological sample. In cases where DNA is amplified, any DNA amplification method known in the art may be employed. Non- limiting examples of DNA amplification methods include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), variants of PCR (e.g., real-time PCR, allele-specific PCR, assembly PCR, asymmetric PCR, digital PCR, emulsion PCR, dial-out PCR, helicase-dependent PCR, nested PCR, hot start PCR, inverse PCR, methylation-specific PCR, miniprimer PCR, multiplex PCR, nested PCR, overlap-extension PCR, thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, touchdown PCR), and ligase chain reaction (LCR). In some cases, DNA amplification is linear. In some cases, DNA amplification is exponential. In some cases, DNA amplification is achieved with nested PCR, which can improve sensitivity of detecting amplified DNA products. [0080] Nucleic acid amplification reactions described herein may be conducted in parallel, in some implementations. Parallel amplification reactions may be amplification reactions that can occur in the same reaction vessel and at the same time. Parallel nucleic acid amplification reactions may be conducted, for example, by including reagents necessary for each nucleic acid amplification reaction in a reaction vessel to obtain a reaction mixture and subjecting the reaction mixture to conditions necessary for each nucleic amplification reaction. For example, reverse transcription amplification and DNA amplification may be conducted in parallel, by providing reagents necessary for both amplification methods in a reaction vessel to form to obtain a reaction mixture and subjecting the reaction mixture to conditions suitable for conducting both amplification reactions. DNA generated from reverse transcription of the RNA may be amplified in parallel to generate an amplified DNA product. Any suitable number of nucleic acid amplification reactions may be conducted in parallel. In some cases, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more nucleic acid amplification reactions are conducted in parallel. [0081] Time may elapse while nucleic acid amplification reactions are occurring. A detector 120 of the device 100 may be capable of detecting a signal during the time while the nucleic acid amplification reaction is occurring. The detector may be capable of detecting the signal without removing the sample 130 from the device. [0082] In various aspects, the detector 120 may detect amplified product (e.g., amplified DNA product, amplified RNA product). Detection of amplified product, including amplified DNA, may be accomplished with any suitable detection method known in the art. The particular type of detection method used may depend, for example, on the particular amplified product, the type of reaction vessel used for amplification, other reagents in a reaction mixture, whether or not a reporter agent was included in a reaction mixture, and if a reporter agent was used, the particular type of reporter agent use. Non-limiting examples of detection methods include optical detection, spectroscopic detection, electrostatic detection, electrochemical detection, and the like. Optical detection methods include, but are not limited to, fluorimetry and UV-vis light absorbance. Spectroscopic detection methods include, but are not limited to, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. Electrostatic detection methods include, but are not limited to, gel based techniques, such as, for example, gel electrophoresis. Electrochemical detection methods include, but are not limited to, electrochemical detection of amplified product after high-performance liquid chromatography separation of the amplified products. [0083] The detector 120 may be capable of detecting an optical signal from the sample 130. The optical signal may be a fluorescent or other luminescent signal from the sample. The optical signal may be generated by the sample in response to a stimulation light provided to the sample. A stimulation light may be provided by a light source. The light source may be within the device 100. In some instances, light may be absorbed by the sample, and the sample may emit light. The emitted light may be at the same or different wavelength from the emitted light. In some instances, the optical signal may be a reflection of light from the light source. Alternatively, light may be shined through the sample, and the detector may be capable of detecting the light that passes through the sample. [0084] In some embodiments, information regarding the presence of and/or an amount of amplified product (e.g., amplified DNA product) may be outputted to a recipient. Information regarding amplified product may be outputted via any suitable means known in the art. Such information may be provided in real-time while the nucleic-acid amplification is underway. In other instances, the information may be provided once the nucleic acid amplification has been completed. In some instances, some data may be provided in real-time while other data may be presented once the amplification is completed. [0085] In some embodiments, such information may be provided verbally to a recipient. In some embodiments, such information may be provided in a report. A report may include any number of desired elements, with non-limiting examples that include information regarding the subject (e.g., sex, age, race, health status, etc.) raw data, processed data (e.g. graphical displays (e.g., figures, charts, data tables, data summaries), determined cycle threshold values, calculation of starting amount of target polynucleotide), conclusions about the presence of the target nucleic acid, diagnosis information, prognosis information, disease information, and the like, and combinations thereof. The report may be provided as a printed report (e.g., a hard copy) or may be provided as an electronic report. In some embodiments, including cases where an electronic report is provided, such information may be outputted via an electronic display, such as a monitor or television, a screen operatively linked with a unit used to obtain the amplified product, a tablet computer screen, a mobile device screen, and the like. Both printed and electronic reports may be stored in files or in databases, respectively, such that they are accessible for comparison with future reports. [0086] Moreover, a report may be transmitted to the recipient at a local or remote location using any suitable communication medium including, for example, a network connection, a wireless connection, or an internet connection. In some embodiments, a report can be sent to a recipient's device, such as a personal computer, phone, tablet, or other device. The report may be viewed online, saved on the recipient's device, or printed. A report can also be transmitted by any other suitable means for transmitting information, with non-limiting examples that include mailing a hardcopy report for reception and/or for review by a recipient. [0087] Moreover, such information may be outputted to various types of recipients. Non-limiting examples of such recipients include the subject from which the biological sample was obtained, a physician, a physician treating the subject, a clinical monitor for a clinical trial, a nurse, a researcher, a laboratory technician, a representative of a pharmaceutical company, a health care company, a biotechnology company, a hospital, a human aid organization, a health care manager, an electronic system (e.g., one or more computers and/or one or more computer servers storing, for example, a subject's medical records), a public health worker, other medical personnel, and other medical facilities. [0088] The device 100 that may include the thermal cycler 110 and detector 120 may include a housing. The housing may partially or completely enclose components of the device. The housing may surround components of the device laterally and/or on the top and bottom. The housing may optionally be a rigid structure. For example, the housing may contain the thermal cycler therein. Optionally, the detector may also be contained within the housing. In other implementations, the detector may be outside the housing of the device. The detector may be an integral part of the device. Alternatively, the detector may be removable or separable from the device. [0089] An optical path 140 may be provided between the sample 130 and the detector 120. A signal from the sample may reach the detector via the optical path. An optical signal from a sample may traverse the optical path to reach the detector. The optical path may include direct line-of-sight between the sample and the detector. In some instances, one or more optical elements may be provided between the sample and the detector. Examples of optical elements may include lenses, mirrors, prisms, diffusers, concentrators, filters, dichroics, optical fibers, or any other type of optical elements. [0090] Optionally, the optical path 140 may be provided entirely within a housing of the device 100. The housing may optically isolate the optical path from the surrounding environment. For example, the housing may be light-tight so that little or no interfering optical signals may be provided within the housing that may interfere with the optical path. Light from outside the housing may not be capable of entering the interior of the housing. This may advantageously reduce inaccuracies in the optical signal detected by the detector 120. [0091] The optical path 140 may remain while the nucleic acid amplification is occurring. The detector may be able to continuously or periodically detect signals from the ample while the nucleic acid amplification is occurring via the optical path. [0092] In some instances, a low voltage may be used to power the device 100. For example, 12 V or less may be used to power the device. The low voltage may be used to power the detector and the thermal cycler. [0093] FIG. IB shows another example of a device for conducting a nucleic acid amplification reaction in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The device 100 may include a thermal cycler 110 and a detector 120. The thermal cycler may be capable of receiving a plurality of samples 130a-d. Optical paths 140a-d may be provided between the samples and the detector. [0094] In some embodiments, a plurality of samples 130a-d may be provided to the thermal cycler. The thermal cycler may be capable of receiving a plurality of samples. The thermal cycler may be capable of receiving the number of samples loaded therein, or may be capable of receiving more than the samples loaded therein. The thermal cycler may have sites capable of receiving samples, and the sites may or may not all be filled. For example, the thermal cycler may be capable of receiving 8 samples, but may have 8 or fewer, 7 or fewer, 6 or fewer, 5 or fewer, 4 or fewer, 3 or fewer, 2 or fewer, 1 sample, or no samples loaded thereon. The samples may be provided within reaction vessels that may be accepted by the thermal cycler. Alternatively, the sample may be directly provided to the thermal cycler without the reaction vessels, or may be loaded on reaction vessels built into the thermal cycler. [0095] The thermal cycler 110 may have one or more wells. The wells may be configured to accept a reaction vessel or sample directly. The wells may be indentations on a support structure. In some instances, the support structure may be a heating/cooling block. For example, the wells may be formed directly into the heating unit itself. The reaction vessels may be inserted into the wells and may directly contact the heating unit. The reaction vessels and samples therein may experience conductive heating and cooling. [0096] A reaction vessel can be part of an array of reaction vessels. An array of reaction vessels may be particularly useful for automating methods and/or simultaneously processing multiple samples 130a-d. For example, a reaction vessel may be a well of a microwell plate comprised of a number of wells. In another example, a reaction vessel may be held in a well of a thermal block of a thermocycler, wherein the block of the thermal cycle comprises multiple wells each capable of receiving a sample vessel. An array comprised of reaction vessels may comprise any appropriate number of reaction vessels. For example, an array may comprise at least about 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 35, 48, 96, 144, 384, or more reaction vessels. A reaction vessel part of an array of reaction vessels may also be individually addressable by a fluid handling device, such that the fluid handling device can correctly identify a reaction vessel and dispense appropriate fluid materials into the reaction vessel. Fluid handling devices may be useful in automating the addition of fluid materials to reaction vessels. [0097] The reaction vessels may be individually movable relative to one another. The reaction vessels may be individually removable from the thermal cycler 110. Alternatively, reaction vessels may be connected to one another. In some instances, groups or strips of reaction vessels may be provided that may be collectively moved relative to other groups or strips of reaction vessels. [0098] As discussed, multiple samples 130a-d may be provided to the thermal cycler. The thermal cycler may simultaneously heat and cool the samples within the thermal cycler. Each of the samples may be controlled along the same temperature profile. Alternatively, different profiles may be provided for different samples. In some instances, the temperature profiles of the samples may be individually controllable, or controllable on a group by group or zone by zone basis. The thermal cycler may include a heating/cooling block that may have the same temperature throughout. Alternatively, a temperature gradient may be provided on the heating/cooling block. Different samples may be placed at different positions along the temperature gradient to yield different thermal cycling temperature profiles. [0099] Each sample 130a-d may provide a signal that may be detectable by one or more detectors 120. Any description herein of a detector may apply to a single detector or multiple detectors. For example, if eight samples are provided, a single detector may detect signals from all eight samples, each sample may have its own detector (yielding a total of eight detectors), or multiple samples may be detected by a single detector, wherein multiple detectors may be provided overall. The detector may be capable of receiving optical signals from the samples during nucleic acid amplification of the samples. The detector may receive the optical signals simultaneously. The detector may receive optical signals from the samples continuously or on a periodic basis. In some instances, the detector may sequentially receive signals from the samples on a sequential or step-through basis. [00100] A plurality of optical pathways 140a-d may be provided. In some instances, individualized optical pathways may be provided between the samples 130a-d and the detector 120. The optical pathways may preferably not interfere with one another. In some instances, the optical pathways may be optically isolated from one another. As previously described, optical pathways may include a line-of-sight between the samples and the detector. In one example, a single imaging device, such as a camera, may image the samples simultaneously. In other examples, optical pathways may include optical elements. For example, separate fiber optic pathways may be provided between each sample and the detector. The multiplexing of the samples and optical detectors may permit the device to load and amplify nucleic acid from multiple samples simultaneously. [00101] Alternatively, a single optical pathway may be provided between a plurality of samples 130a-d and the detector 120. [00102] In some instances, a low voltage may be used to power the device 100. For example, 12 V or less may be used to power the device. The low voltage may be used to power the detector and the thermal cycler. [00103] FIG. 2 shows samples that may be provided within sample containers supported by a device in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The sample containers may be reaction vessels 210a, 210b. The reaction vessels may be supported by a supporting device 200. The supporting device may have one or more indentations into which the reaction vessels may be inserted. The indentations may be wells. The reaction vessels may contain samples 220a, 220b therein. Optical signals 230a, 230b may be emitted from the sample and may leave the reaction vessels. [00104] The supporting device may have one or more indentations built therein. The support device may be a heating and cooling device. Any description of heating herein may also apply to both heating and cooling. In some instances, the support device may be heated using resistive conductive heating. In some instances, the support device may be Peltier device that may be capable of heating and cooling the sample therein. The support device may be a solid block or may include cavities, passageways, indentations, or other features. The support device may be formed from a metallic material. In some instances, the support device may be formed from a material of high thermal conductivity. The support device itself may be a heater, or may be in thermal communication with a heater. For example, the support device may be a thermally conductive block positioned on top of a heating block. [00105] The support device may have any number of indentations therein. For example, the support device may include greater than or equal to about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 35, 40, 48, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 96, 100, 120, 144, 150, 200, 250, 300, 384, 400, 500, 700, 1000, 1536, 2000 indentations. The support device may include fewer than or equal to about any of the number indentations described herein. In some instances, the number of indentations may fall in a range between any two of the values of described herein. The indentations may be sized and/or shaped to accept one or more reaction vessels 210a, 210b. The outer surface of the reaction vessels may contact interior surfaces of the indentation. The contact may be substantially flush so that the majority of the outer surface area of the reaction vessel contacts the indentation. This may improve thermal contact between the sample contained therein and a heating and cooling element. [00106] The reaction vessels 210a, 210b may have any characteristic or dimension as described elsewhere herein. In some instances, all reaction vessels loaded into the thermal cycler may have the same characteristics. Otherwise, different types of reaction vessels may be loaded thereon. The support may be capable of accepting a single type of reaction vessel or multiple types of reaction vessels. The indentations on the support may all be filled with reaction vessels. Alternatively, one or more empty indentation may remain. A user may have an option of loading the reaction vessels thereon at the user's discretion. [00107] The reaction vessels 210a, 210b may contain a sample 220a, 220b therein. The sample may have any characteristics as described elsewhere herein. The sample may be a reaction mixture that may include a target nucleic acid. The sample may also include a reporter agent and/or any other types of reagents needed for nucleic acid amplification. The samples within the reaction vessels may be from the same subject or from different subjects. The samples may be from the same type of subject (e.g., human or same type of animal) or from different types of subjects. The samples may be the same type of sample or may be different types of samples. For example, they may be different types of biological samples and/or collected from different portions of one or more subjects. The same amount of sample may be provided or varying amounts of sample may be provided. [00108] Optical signals 230a, 230b may be provided from the sample 220a, 220b. The optical signals may leave the reaction vessels 210a, 210b. In some instances, the optical signals may leave via a top of the reaction vessel. In other instances, the optical signals may leave via a bottom or side of the reaction vessel. In some instances, optical elements may be built into the support that may aid in permitting optical signals to escape. [00109] A low voltage may be used to for thermal cycling. In some embodiment, the low voltage may be less than or equal to about 60 V, 50 V, 48 V, 40 V, 30 V, 24 V, 20 V, 18 V, 16 V, 15 V, 14 V, 13 V, 12V, 11 V, 10V, 9 V, 8V, 7 V, 6 V, 5 V, 4 V, 3 V, 2 V, or 1 V to perform the thermal cycling. In some instances, the a low voltage of less than or equal to about 50 V, 40 V, 30 V, 24 V, 20 V, 18 V, 16 V, 15 V, 14 V, 13 V, 12V, 1 1 V, 10V, 9 V, 8V, 7 V, 6 V, 5 V, 4 V, 3 V, 2 V, or 1 V may be used to perform the combination of thermal cycling and detecting. [00110] In some instances, a low degree of power may be used for thermal cycling, or the combination of thermal cycling and detecting. For instance, about 84 W may be used to perform the thermal cycling and detecting. In some instances, a low power may be less than or equal to about 250 W, 200 W, 150 W, 130 W, 120 W, 110 W, 100 W, 90 W, 85 W, 84 W, 83 W, 80 W, 75 W, 70 W, 65 W, 60 W, 55 W, 50 W, 45 W, 40 W, 35 W, 30 W, 25 W, 20 W, 15 W, 10 W, 5 W, 1 W, 500 mW, 100 mW, 50 mW, 10 mW, 5 mW, or 1 mW. The amount of power used to operate the device may be less than or equal to any of the values described herein. Alternatively, the amount of power used to operate the device may be greater than equal to any of the values described herein. The amount of power used to operate the device may fall into a range between any two of the values described herein. The amount of power used to operate the thermal cycler and detector may have a total less than any of the values described herein. The amount of power used to operate the thermal cycler and detector may have a total greater than any of the values described herein. The amount of power used to operate the thermal cycler and detector may fall into a range between any two of the values described herein. [00111] FIG. 3 shows an example of a thermal cycle in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The thermal cycles may include healing and cooling of a sample. For example, there may be temperature for template denaturing, a temperature for primer annealing, and a temperature for DNA synthesis. The thermal cycler of the device may control the temperature to heat and cool to these temperatures. Temperature measurements are provided by way of example only and are not limiting. Similarly, amounts of time are provided by way of example only and are not limiting. [00112] The thermal cycler may cause the sample to undergo any number of thermal cycles. The nucleic acid amplification may occur over the course of the multiple cycles. Examples of thermal cycling processes are provided as follows, and are not limiting. Any type of thermal cycling technique known in the art may be employed by the device. [00113] In any of the various aspects, primer sets directed to a target nucleic acid may be utilized to conduct nucleic acid amplification reaction. Primer sets generally comprise one or more primers. For example, a primer set may comprise about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more primers. In some cases, a primer set or may comprise primers directed to different amplified products or different nucleic acid amplification reactions. For example, a primer set may comprise a first primer necessary to generate a first strand of nucleic acid product that is complementary to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid and a second primer complementary to the nucleic acid strand product necessary to generate a second strand of nucleic acid product that is complementary to at least a portion of the first strand of nucleic acid product. [00114] For example, a primer set may be directed to a target RNA. The primer set may comprise a first primer that can be used to generate a first strand of nucleic acid product that is complementary to at least a portion the target RNA. In the case of a reverse transcription reaction, the first strand of nucleic acid product may be DNA. The primer set may also comprise a second primer that can be used to generate a second strand of nucleic acid product that is complementary to at least a portion of the first strand of nucleic acid product. In the case of a reverse transcription reaction conducted in parallel with DNA amplification, the second strand of nucleic acid product may be a strand of nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) product that is complementary to a strand of DNA generated from an RNA template. [00115] Where desired, any suitable number of primer sets may be used. For example, about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more primer sets may be used. Where multiple primer sets are used, one or more primer sets may each correspond to a particular nucleic acid amplification reaction or amplified product. [00116] In some embodiments, a DNA polymerase is used. Any suitable DNA polymerase may be used, including commercially available DNA polymerases. A DNA polymerase generally refers to an enzyme that is capable of incorporating nucleotides to a strand of DNA in a template bound fashion. Non-limiting examples of DNA polymerases include Taq polymerase, Tth polymerase, Tli polymerase, Pfu polymerase, VENT polymerase, DEEPVENT polymerase, EX-Taq polymerase, LA-Taq polymerase, Expand polymerases, Sso polymerase, Poc polymerase, Pab polymerase, Mth polymerase, Pho polymerase, ES4 polymerase, Tru polymerase, Tac polymerase, Tne polymerase, Tma polymerase, Tih polymerase, Tfi polymerase, Platinum Taq polymerases, Hi- Fi polymerase, Tbr polymerase, Tfl polymerase, Pfutubo polymerase, Pyrobest polymerase, Pwo polymerase, KOD polymerase, Bst polymerase, Sac polymerase, Klenow fragment, and variants, modified products and derivatives thereof. For certain Hot Start Polymerase, a denaturation step at 94°C -95°C for 2 minutes to 10 minutes may be required, which may change the thermal profile based on different polymerases. [00117] A reverse transcriptase is used may be used in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Any suitable reverse transcriptase may be used. A reverse transcriptase generally refers to an enzyme that is capable of incorporating nucleotides to a strand of DNA, when bound to an RNA template. Non-limiting examples of reverse transcriptases include HTV-1 reverse transcriptase, M-MLV reverse transcriptase, AMV reverse transcriptase, telomerase reverse transcriptase, and variants, modified products and derivatives thereof. [00118] In various aspects, primer extension reactions are utilized to generate amplified product. Primer extension reactions generally comprise a cycle of incubating a reaction mixture at a denaturation temperature for a denaturation duration and incubating a reaction mixture at an elongation temperature for an elongation duration. [00119] Denaturation temperatures may vary depending upon, for example, the particular biological sample analyzed, the particular source of target nucleic acid (e.g., viral particle, bacteria) in the biological sample, the reagents used, and/or the desired reaction conditions. For example, a denaturation temperature may be from about 80°C to about 110°C. In some examples, a denaturation temperature may be from about 90°C to about 100°C. In some examples, a denaturation temperature may be from about 90°C to about 97°C. In some examples, a denaturation temperature may be from about 92°C to about 95 °C. In still other examples, a denaturation temperature may be about 80°, 81°C, 82°C, 83°C, 84°C, 85°C, 86°C, 87°C, 88°C, 89°C, 90°C, 91°C, 92°C, 93°C, 94°C, 95°C, 96°C, 97°C, 98°C, 99°C, or 100°C. [00120] Denaturation durations may vary depending upon, for example, the particular biological sample analyzed, the particular source of target nucleic acid (e.g., viral particle, bacteria) in the biological sample, the reagents used, and/or the desired reaction conditions. For example, a denaturation duration may be less than or equal to 300 seconds, 240 seconds, 180 seconds, 120 seconds, 90 seconds, 60 seconds, 55 seconds, 50 seconds, 45 seconds, 40 seconds, 35 seconds, 30 seconds, 25 seconds, 20 seconds, 15 seconds, 10 seconds, 5 seconds, 2 seconds, or 1 second. For example, a denaturation duration may be no more than 120 seconds, 90 seconds, 60 seconds, 55 seconds, 50 seconds, 45 seconds, 40 seconds, 35 seconds, 30 seconds, 25 seconds, 20 seconds, 15 seconds, 10 seconds, 5 seconds, 2 seconds, or 1 second. [00121] Elongation temperatures may vary depending upon, for example, the particular biological sample analyzed, the particular source of target nucleic acid (e.g., viral particle, bacteria) in the biological sample, the reagents used, and/or the desired reaction conditions. For example, an elongation temperature may be from about 30°C to about 80°C. In some examples, an elongation temperature may be from about 35°C to about 72°C. In some examples, an elongation temperature may be from about 45°C to about 65°C. In some examples, an elongation temperature may be from about 35°C to about 65°C. In some examples, an elongation temperature may be from about 40°C to about 60°C. In some examples, an elongation temperature may be from about 50°C to about 60°C. In still other examples, an elongation temperature may be about 35°, 36°C, 37°C, 38°C, 39°C, 40°C, 41 °C, 42°C, 43°C, 44°C, 45°C, 46°C, 47°C, 48°C, 49°C, 50°C, 51°C, 52°C, 53°C, 54°C, 55°C, 56°C, 57°C, 58°C, 59°C, 60°C, 61 °C, 62°C, 63°C, 64°C, 65°C, 66°C, 67°C, 68°C, 69°C, 70°C, 71 °C, 72°C, 73°C, 74°C, 75°C, 76°C, 77°C, 78°C, 79°C, or 80°C. [00122] Elongation durations may vary depending upon, for example, the particular biological sample analyzed, the particular source of target nucleic acid (e.g., viral particle, bacteria) in the biological sample, the reagents used, and/or the desired reaction conditions. For example, an elongation duration may be less than or equal to 300 seconds, 240 seconds, 180 seconds, 120 seconds, 90 seconds, 60 seconds, 55 seconds, 50 seconds, 45 seconds, 40 seconds, 35 seconds, 30 seconds, 25 seconds, 20 seconds, 15 seconds, 10 seconds, 5 seconds, 2 seconds, or 1 second. For example, an elongation duration may be no more than 120 seconds, 90 seconds, 60 seconds, 55 seconds, 50 seconds, 45 seconds, 40 seconds, 35 seconds, 30 seconds, 25 seconds, 20 seconds, 15 seconds, 10 seconds, 5 seconds, 2 seconds, or 1 second. [00123] In any of the various aspects, multiple cycles of a primer extension reaction can be conducted. Any suitable number of cycles may be conducted. For example, the number of cycles conducted may be less than about 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, or 5 cycles. The number of cycles conducted may depend upon, for example, the number of cycles (e.g., cycle threshold value (Ct)) necessary to obtain a detectable amplified product (e.g., a detectable amount of amplified DNA product that is indicative of the presence of a target RNA in a biological sample). For example, the number of cycles necessary to obtain a detectable amplified product (e.g., a detectable amount of DNA product that is indicative of the presence of a target RNA in a biological sample) may be less than about or about 100 cycles, 75 cycles, 70 cycles, 65 cycles, 60 cycles, 55 cycles, 50 cycles, 40 cycles, 35 cycles, 30 cycles, 25 cycles, 20 cycles, 15 cycles, 10 cycles, or 5 cycles. Moreover, in some embodiments, a detectable amount of an amplifiable product (e.g., a detectable amount of DNA product that is indicative of the presence of a target RNA in a biological sample) may be obtained at a cycle threshold value (Ct) of less than 100, 75, 70, 65, 60, 55, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, or 5. [00124] The time for which amplification yields a detectable amount of amplified product indicative of the presence of a target nucleic acid amplified can vary depending upon the biological sample from which the target nucleic acid was obtained, the particular nucleic acid amplification reactions to be conducted, and the particular number of cycles of amplification reaction desired. For example, amplification of a target nucleic acid may yield a detectable amount of amplified product indicative to the presence of the target nucleic acid at time period of 120 minutes or less; 90 minutes or less; 60 minutes or less; 50 minutes or less; 45 minutes or less; 40 minutes or less; 35 minutes or less; 30 minutes or less; 25 minutes or less; 20 minutes or less; 15 minutes or less; 10 minutes or less; or 5 minutes or less. [00125] In some embodiments, amplification of a target RNA may yield a detectable amount of amplified DNA product indicative to the presence of the target RNA at time period of 120 minutes or less; 90 minutes or less; 60 minutes or less; 50 minutes or less; 45 minutes or less; 40 minutes or less; 35 minutes or less; 30 minutes or less; 25 minutes or less; 20 minutes or less; 15 minutes or less; 10 minutes or less; or 5 minutes or less. [00126] In some embodiments, a reaction mixture may be subjected to a plurality of series of primer extension reactions. An individual series of the plurality may comprise multiple cycles of a particular primer extension reaction, characterized, for example, by particular denaturation and elongation conditions as described elsewhere herein. Generally, each individual series differs from at least one other individual series in the plurality with respect to, for example, a denaturation condition and/or elongation condition. An individual series may differ from another individual series in a plurality of series, for example, with respect to any one, two, three, or all four of denaturing temperature, denaturing duration, elongation temperature, and elongation duration. Moreover, a plurality of series may comprise any number of individual series such as, for example, at least about or about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more individual series. [00127] For example, a plurality of series of primer extension reactions may comprise a first series and a second series. The first series, for example, may comprise more than ten cycles of a primer extension reaction, where each cycle of the first series comprises (i) incubating a reaction mixture at about 92°C to about 95°C for no more than 30 seconds followed by (ii) incubating the reaction mixture at about 35°C to about 65°C for no more than about one minute. The second series, for example, may comprise more than ten cycles of a primer extension reaction, where each cycle of the second series comprises (i) incubating the reaction mixture at about 92°C to about 95 °C for no more than 30 seconds followed by (ii) incubating the reaction mixture at about 40°C to about 60°C for no more than about 1 minute. In this particular example, the first and second series differ in their elongation temperature condition. The example, however, is not meant to be limiting as any combination of different elongation and denaturing conditions could be used. [00128] In some embodiments, the ramping time (i.e., the time the thermal cycler takes to transition from one temperature to another) and/or ramping rate can be important factors in amplification. For example, the temperature and time for which amplification yields a detectable amount of amplified product indicative of the presence of a target nucleic acid can vary depending upon the ramping rate and/or ramping time. The ramping rate can impact the temperature(s) and time(s) used for amplification. [00129] Optionally, the ramping time and/or ramping rate can be different between cycles. In some situations, however, the ramping time and/or ramping rate between cycles can be the same. The ramping time and/or ramping rate can be adjusted based on the sample(s) that are being processed. [00130] In some situations, the ramping time between different temperatures can be determined, for example, based on the nature of the sample and the reaction conditions. The exact temperature and incubation time can also be determined based on the nature of the sample and the reaction conditions. In some embodiments, a single sample can be processed (e.g., subjected to amplification conditions) multiple times using multiple thermal cycles, with each thermal cycle differing for example by the ramping time, temperature, and/or incubation time. The best or optimum thermal cycle can then be chosen for that particular sample. This provides a robust and efficient method of tailoring the thermal cycles to the specific sample or combination of samples being tested. [00131] In some embodiments, a target nucleic acid may be subjected to a denaturing condition prior to initiation of a primer extension reaction. In the case of a plurality of series of primer extension reactions, the target nucleic acid may be subjected to a denaturing condition prior to executing the plurality of series or may be subjected to a denaturing condition between series of the plurality. For example, the target nucleic acid may be subjected to a denaturing condition between a first series and a second series of a plurality of series. Non-limiting examples of such denaturing conditions include a denaturing temperature profile (e.g., one or more denaturing temperatures) and a denaturing agent. [00132] An advantage of conducting a plurality of series of primer extension reaction may be that, when compared to a single series of primer extension reactions under comparable denaturing and elongation conditions, the plurality of series approach yields a detectable amount of amplified product that is indicative of the presence of a target nucleic acid in a biological sample with a lower cycle threshold value. Use of a plurality of series of primer extension reactions may reduce such cycle threshold values by at least about or about 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% when compared to a single series under comparable denaturing and elongation conditions. [00133] In some embodiments, a biological sample may be preheated prior to conducting a primer extension reaction. The temperature (e.g., a preheating temperature) at which and duration (e.g., a preheating duration) for which a biological sample is preheated may vary depending upon, for example, the particular biological sample being analyzed. In some examples, a biological sample may be preheated for no more than about 60 minutes, 50 minutes, 40 minutes, 30 minutes, 25 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 9 minutes, 8 minutes, 7 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, 1 minute, 45 seconds, 30 seconds, 20 seconds, 15 seconds, 10 seconds, or 5 seconds. In some examples, a biological sample may be preheated at a temperature from about 80°C to about 110°C. In some examples, a biological sample may be preheated at a temperature from about 90°C to about 100°C. In some examples, a biological sample may be preheated at a temperature from about 90°C to about 97°C. In some examples, a biological sample may be preheated at a temperature from about 92°C to about 95°C. In still other examples, a biological sample may be preheated at a temperature of about 80°, 81°C, 82°C, 83°C, 84°C, 85°C, 86°C, 87°C, 88°C, 89°C, 90°C, 91 °C, 92°C, 93°C, 94°C, 95°C, 96°C, 97°C, 98°C, 99°C, or 100°C. [00134] In any of the various aspects, the time required to complete the elements of a method may vary depending upon the particular steps of the method. For example, an amount of time for completing the elements of a method may be from about 5 minutes to about 120 minutes. In other examples, an amount of time for completing the elements of a method may be from about 5 minutes to about 60 minutes. In other examples, an amount of time for completing the elements of a method may be from about 5 minutes to about 30 minutes. In other examples, an amount of time for completing the elements of a method may be less than or equal to 120 minutes, less than or equal to 90 minutes, less than or equal to 75 minutes, less than or equal to 60 minutes, less than or equal to 45 minutes, less than or equal to 40 minutes, less than or equal to 35 minutes, less than or equal to 30 minutes, less than or equal to 25 minutes, less than or equal to 20 minutes, less than or equal to 15 minutes, less than or equal to 10 minutes, or less than or equal to 5 minutes. [00135] The automated thermal cycler may be capable of controlling a temperature of a sample precisely to achieve a desired temperature profile. The automated thermal cycler may be capable of controlling the temperature to within about plus or minus 5 degrees C, 4 Degrees C, 3 degrees C, 2 degrees C, 1.2 degrees C, 1 degree C, 0.7 degrees C, 0.5 degrees C, 0.3 degrees C, 0.1 degrees C, 0.05 degrees C, 0.01 degrees C, 0.005 degrees C, or 0.001 degrees C. The automated thermal cycler may advantageously be capable of providing high quality temperature control while operating at a low voltage and/or low power. The automated thermal cycler may be advantageously capable of delivering high quality temperature control while having small dimensions. In some instances, heat blocks may be used. Liquid metal heat blocks may be an example of heat blocks that may be used. A heating system using thermally conductive fluid may optionally be used. Alternatively, no thermally conductive fluid may be used. In some instances, a high density of heating and/or cooling elements may be provided for a heat block. [00136] Detection of signals from the sample undergoing amplification may occur throughout the process. The detection may occur continuously or at one or more points during the amplification process. The sample may emit optical signals throughout the process. The optical signals may be related to the amount of amplified target nucleic acid in the sample. [00137] FIG. 4 shows an example of a device and a display in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The device 400 may be used to conduct nucleic acid amplification of a target nucleic acid in a sample. The sample may be loaded into the device. A thermal cycler of the device may alternating heat and cool the sample. The device may include a detector that may be capable of detecting signals relating to the amplification of the target nucleic acid in the sample in real-time. [00138] Optionally, data relating to the detected signals may be displayed in real-time. For example, data relating to the progress of the nucleic acid amplification and/or results of the nucleic acid amplification may be displayed while amplification is occurring. In some instances, a display 410 may be built-into the device. For example, the display may be provided on a housing of the device. Any description of a display may apply to any type of output module. The display may include a visual display, as well as optional audio or tactile output of information. The display may show information on a screen or other type of user interface (UI). For example, a screen may be built into the device. [00139] In other instances, the data may be shown on a separate display device 420. The separate display device may communicate with the device 400. In some instances, communications may occur via a connection 430. The connection may be a hard-wired connection or a wireless connection. Direct communications may occur between the device and the display device. For example, Bluetooth, infra-red communications, radio, WiFi, or other direct communications may occur. In other instances, indirect communications may occur between the device and the display device. For examples, communications may occur over a network, such as a local area network (LAN), or wide area network (WAN) such as the Internet. In some instances, telecommunications networks may be used (e.g., cellular phone networks, data networks). In some examples, 3G or 4G networks may be used for communications. One or more intermediate devices, such as relay devices (e.g., towers) or router, may be used in communications. Alternatively, no intermediate devices may be used. [00140] A device 400 may have an input module that receives a user request to amplify a target nucleic acid (e.g., target RNA, target DNA) present in a biological sample obtained direct from a subject. Any suitable module capable of accepting such a user request may be used. The input module may comprise, for example, a device that comprises one or more processors. The input module may be built into the device. The input module may be integrated into a housing of the device or accessible from outside the housing. [00141] Alternatively, the input module may be separate or separable from the device. The input module may communicate with the device over a connection, such as those described elsewhere herein. Non-limiting examples of devices that comprise processors include a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a tablet computer (e.g., Apple® iPad, Samsung® Galaxy Tab), a cell phone, a smart phone (e.g., Apple® iPhone, Android® enabled phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a video-game console, a television, a music playback device (e.g., Apple® iPod), a video playback device, a pager, and a calculator. Processors may be associated with one or more controllers, calculation units, and/or other units of a computer system, or implanted in firmware as desired. If implemented in software, the routines (or programs) may be stored in any computer readable memory such as in RAM, ROM, flash memory, a magnetic disk, a laser disk, or other storage medium. Likewise, this software may be delivered to a device via any known delivery method including, for example, over a communication channel such as a telephone line, the internet, a local intranet, a wireless connection, etc., or via a transportable medium, such as a computer readable disk, flash drive, etc. The various steps may be implemented as various blocks, operations, tools, modules or techniques which, in turn, may be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof. When implemented in hardware, some or all of the blocks, operations, techniques, etc. may be implemented in, for example, a custom integrated circuit (IC), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable logic array (FPGA), a programmable logic array (PLA), etc. [00142] In some embodiments, the input module is configured to receive a user request to perform amplification of the target nucleic acid. The input module may receive the user request directly (e.g. by way of an input device such as a keyboard, mouse, or touch screen operated by the user) or indirectly (e.g. through a wired or wireless connection, including over the internet). Via output electronics, the input module may provide the user's request to the amplification module. In some embodiments, an input module may include a user interface (UI), such as a graphical user interface (GUI), that is configured to enable a user provide a request to amplify the target nucleic acid. A GUI can include textual, graphical and/or audio components. A GUI can be provided on an electronic display, including the display of a device comprising a computer processor. Such a display may include a resistive or capacitive touch screen. [00143] Non-limiting examples of users include the subject from which the biological sample was obtained, medical personnel, clinicians (e.g., doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians), laboratory personnel (e.g., hospital laboratory technicians, research scientists, pharmaceutical scientists), a clinical monitor for a clinical trial, or others in the health care industry. [00144] As previously described, the system comprises an output module operatively connected to the amplification module. In some embodiments the output module may comprise a device with a processor as described above for the input module. The output module may include input devices as described herein and/or may comprise input electronics for communication with the amplification module. In some embodiments, the output module may be an electronic display, such as a display 410 on a nucleic acid amplification device or a separate display device 420. In some cases, the electronic display may comprise a UI. In some embodiments, the output module is a communication interface operatively coupled to a computer network such as, for example, the internet. In some embodiments, the output module may transmit information to a recipient at a local or remote location using any suitable communication medium, including a computer network, a wireless network, a local intranet, or the internet. In some embodiments, the output module is capable of analyzing data received from the amplification module. The output module may analyze information in real-time while amplification is occurring. Some data may be analyzed after the amplification has been completed. In some cases, the output module includes a report generator capable of generating a report and transmitting the report to a recipient, wherein the report contains any information regarding the amount and/or presence of amplified product as described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, the output module may transmit information automatically in response to information received from the amplification module, such as in the form of raw data or data analysis performed by software included in the amplification module. Alternatively, the output module may transmit information after receiving instructions from a user. Information transmitted by the output module may be viewed electronically or printed from a printer. [00145] One or more of the input module, amplification module, and output module may be contained within the same device or may comprise one or more of the same components. For example, an amplification module may also comprise an input module, an output module, or both. In other examples, a device comprising a processor may be included in both the input module and the output module. A user may use the device to request that a target nucleic acid be amplified and may also be used as a means to transmit information regarding amplified product to a recipient. In some cases, a device comprising a processor may be included in all three modules, such that the device comprising a processor may also be used to control, provide instructions to, and receive information back from instrumentation (e.g., a thermal cycler, a detector, a fluid handling device) included in the amplification module or any other module. [00146] In some instances, low voltage may be used to power the device. Low voltage may be used to power the amplification module and detector. In some instances, low voltage may be used to power the amplification module, detector and output module. Optionally, low voltage may be used to power the input module, amplification module, detector, and output module. Low voltage may be used to power any one or more of the input module, amplification module, detector, and output module. Low voltage as described herein may refer to 12 V or less, or any other voltage values as described elsewhere herein. For example, a total of 12 V or less (or any other voltage value described elsewhere herein) may be used to power the simultaneous use of the amplification module, detector and output module, wherein the detector may detect amplification in real-time, and the output module may optionally show results of detected amplification in real-time. [00147] FIG. 5 shows an example of power being provided to a device that includes a battery in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. A device may include a thermal cycler 510 and detector 520 as described elsewhere herein. The device may also be operably linked to an energy storage device 530. [00148] The energy storage device 530 may be a battery pack. The battery pack may be a portable battery pack. The battery pack may comprise one or more batteries. The batteries may be an electrochemical energy storage device. For example, the battery pack may include a single or multiple battery cells. The battery may be a lithium-based battery, such as a lithium ion battery. The battery may have any chemistry, including but not limited to lead acid batteries, valve regulated lead acid batteries (e.g., gel batteries, absorbed glass mat batteries), nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries, nickel-zinc (NiZn) batteries, nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, or lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. [00149] The energy storage device 530 may be part of the device 500. In one example, the energy storage device may be provided within a housing of the device. The energy storage device may be removable from the device or may be an integral part of the device. In some instances, the energy storage device may be placed within the housing of the device and/or removed from within the housing of the device. Energy storage devices may be swapped or exchanged. In some instances, the energy storage devices may be rechargeable. The energy storage devices may be rechargeable while within the device, or may be removed to be recharged. [00150] In another example, the energy storage device may be directly attached to the device but not within the housing of the device. For example, an external attachment and/or connection may be provided. The energy storage device may directly contact the device housing. The energy storage device may be attached to the device and into place via one or more connector or mechanical fastener. The energy storage device may be separably attached to the device. For example, the energy storage may be attached and detached from the device. Energy storage devices may be swapped. The energy storage device may be rechargeable. The energy storage devices may be rechargeable while attached to the device, or may be separated to be recharged. [00151] The energy storage device may be electrically connected to the device via one or more connector. For example, the connector may be a wire, cable, or other conductive pathway. Optionally, the connector may be a flexible conductive pathway. For example, the energy storage device may be plugged into the device or vice versa. The energy storage device and the device may be separable from one another. Different energy storage devices may be swapped for the device. For example, the device may plug into different energy storage devices. The energy storage device may be rechargeable. The energy storage devices may be rechargeable while electrically connected to the device, or may be separated to be recharged. A physical electrical connection may be provided between the energy storage device and the device. Alternatively, the energy storage device may wirelessly power the device. [00152] The energy storage device may use low voltage to power the device. For example, the energy storage device may provide no more than 12 V or other voltage values described elsewhere herein to power the device. The storage device may use no more than a total of 12 V (or any other voltage value described elsewhere herein) to power the thermal cycler and the detector of the device. Optionally, other components of the device (e.g., input module, output module, light source, processors), may also be powered using no more than a total of 12 V. [00153] The energy storage device may receive a low voltage power when charging the device. For example, no more than 12 V, or other voltage values described elsewhere herein, may be used to charge the energy storage device. The energy storage device may optionally output energy at the same voltage as it receives. [00154] In some instances, when energy is coming in from an external power source, the device may be powered directly from the external power source. In another example, even when energy is coming in from an external power source, the device may be powered through the energy storage device, and the external power source may be used to charge the energy storage device. In some instances, the energy coming in from the external power source may be used to power the device when the energy storage unit is fully charged. [00155] As previously described any low voltage power may be used to power the device. Similarly, any low voltage power may be used to charge the energy storage device. Any reference to low voltage may include a voltage of 50 V or less, 40 V, or less, 35 V, or less, 30 V, or less, 25 V or less, 24 V or less, 22 V or less, 20 V or less, 19 V or less, 18 V or less, 17 V or less, 16 V or less, 15 V or less, 14 V or less, 13.5 V or less, 13 V or les, 12.5 V or less, 12 V or less, 11.5 V or less, 11 V or less, 10.5 V or less, 10 V or less, 9.5 V or less, 9 V or less, 8 V or less, 7 V or less, 6 V or less, 5 V or less, 4 V or less, 3 V or less, 2 V or less, 1 V or less, 500 mV or less, 200 mV or les, 100 mV or less, 50 mV or less, 10 mV or less, 5 mV or less, or 1 mV or less. [00156] The device may be capable of operating at low power. Any combination of components may be capable of operating at low power. For example, the thermal cycler and the detector may be capable of operating at a combined low power.

In some instances, one or more set of protocols may be used to govern whether the power flowing to the device is used to directly operate the device or charge an energy storage device that may be used to power the device. In some instances, both actions may simultaneously occur. [00226] FIG. 12A shows an example of a connection between a device and a charging port in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The device 1200 may be connected to a charging port 1210 via a power connector 1220. The power connector may include a plug that may fit into the charging port. The device may come equipped with a power connector that may be configured to directly connect to the charging port. The power connector may include one or more prongs, pins, indentations, or conductive surfaces. [00227] The charging port may be capable of providing low voltage power to the device to permit operation of the device. The charging port may be on-board the vehicle. The charging port may be any off-grid charging port. The charging port may be powered by a vehicle battery. The charging port may be any other type of charging port electrically connected to any type of external power source as described elsewhere herein. [00228] FIG. 12B shows an example of a connection between a device and a charging point via an adaptor in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The device 1200 may be connected to a charging port 1210 via a power connector 1220 and an adaptor 1230. The power connector may not directly fit into the charging port, or may not be configured to regulate the power coming from the charging port for operation of the vehicle. The adaptor may provide one or more of these functions. The adaptor may be provided between the power connector of the device and the charging port. [00229] The adaptor may be configured to physically fit into the charging port. The adaptor may be configured to mechanically and/or electrically connect to the charging port. The power connector may be not be capable of directly mechanically and/or electrically connecting to the charging port. In some instances, the adaptor may or may not provide some power regulation or conversion when providing power to the power connector. For example, the adaptor may convert DC to AC. In another example, the adaptor may modify or regulate voltage and/or current from the charging port to the power connector. [00230] Any description herein of connecting the device to the charging port may or may not include the use of one or more adaptors. [00231] A nucleic acid amplification device may be deployed with aid of one or more vehicles. The nucleic acid amplification device may be a portable device that can be carried within a vehicle. The vehicle may provide power to the nucleic acid amplification device at a low voltage power, such as 12 V or other voltage values described elsewhere herein. The power provided to the device may be used to charge an energy storage unit of the device and/or directly power one or more other component of the device. The power may be provided to the device via a charging port while the vehicle is turned on. The power may be provided to the device while the vehicle is stationary or while the vehicle is in motion. The device may thus advantageously be deployed to multiple locations. These may include remote locations that may otherwise not have the power sources capable of powering the device. These may include remote locations where rolling blackouts may occur so reliable access to power may not be provided. [00232] The nucleic acid amplification device may receive a sample a location. The device may conduct nucleic acid amplification at the location or while the device is in transit to another location. The nucleic acid amplification device may receive the sample while the device is outside the vehicle, or may receive the sample while the device is within the vehicle. The device may receive the sample while the vehicle is stationary or in motion. [00233] The device may be connected to a charging port of the vehicle while it is in operation. Alternatively, the device may be disconnected from a charging port of the vehicle while it is in operation. The device may have an energy storage unit that may store energy while the device is connected to the vehicle. When the device is disconnected from the vehicle, the energy storage unit may be used to power the device. This may permit the device to be charged while in transit to a location. The device may then be taken out of the vehicle and used to conduct nucleic acid amplifications at the location using the stored energy. If the device depletes the charge of the energy storage unit, the device may be re-connected to the vehicle to power the device and/or charge the energy storage unit. Thus, as long as a vehicle is available, a ready power source may be provided for the device. This may advantageously couple transport of a device to a remote location with powering the device at any location to which it has been transported. [00234] Any description herein of a vehicle may also apply to any other type of power source, such as those described elsewhere herein. [00235] FIG. 13 shows an example of a method of deploying a device in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. One or more different locations A, B, C, D may be provided. The locations may or may not be remote from one another. Infrastructure such as roads (or paved roads) may or may not exist between the various locations. [00236] In one or more of the locations A, a facility 1410 may be provided. The facility may have a structure, such as one or more walls and/or a ceiling. The facility may or may not be a laboratory facility deigned to conduct analysis of biological samples. The facility may or may not be powered by an external power source. The facility may or may not be powered by-the-grid (e.g., via a power utility). In some instances, a device 1400a useful for conducting nucleic acid amplification may be provided at the facility. The device may be powered through the facility. A power source of the facility may be used to power the device. This may or may not be a low voltage power source. A user may be provided to operate the device. [00237] In some instances, samples may be provided from subjects that are in the proximity of the device. For example, samples from subjects at or near location A may be provided. In other instances, samples may be provided from subjects that are at other locations. The remote samples may be sent from the other locations to the facility. In some instances, this may delay results getting back to the subjects or individuals at the other locations. [00238] A vehicle 1420b may be sent to another location B. The vehicle may have a device 1400b for conducting nucleic acid amplification. The device may optionally be electrically connected to the vehicle while the vehicle is in operation. The device may be powered and/or charged by the vehicle when the vehicle is in operation. The device may be powered and/or charged by the vehicle while the vehicle is in motion (e.g., from location A to location B). Permitting a device to be charged while the vehicle is in transit may permit the device to be at a substantially charged state when the device arrives at the destination B. In some instances, the device may be used at the destination to perform nucleic acid amplification at the location. The device may be powered by the vehicle at the location. For example, a car or other type of vehicle may be turned on and used to power a device while the device is running the nucleic acid amplification at the location. Alternatively, the device may operate at the location using an energy storage device that has already been charged. The energy storage device may have been charged while the device was in transit. Charging the device while the device is in transmit may advantageously provide greater flexibility that may allow the vehicle to transported from one location to another. The locations need not have grid power sources, or the use of the device need not rely on grid power sources. Furthermore, the device may be charged to a ready-to-use state while in transit which may save time when the device arrives at a destination. [00239] In some instances, one or more subjects may provide a sample at a destination B. The nucleic acid amplification may occur at the destination. POC testing may permit the results to be provided at the destination. In some instances, real-time PCR or detection may occur, which may permit results to provided in real-time or instantaneously to subjects at the location. This may permit the nucleic acid amplification device to be brought to otherwise remote locations and allow testing that may provide much faster results than other situations. This may be advantageous for disease prognosis and/or treatment. This may also aid in the detection and prevention of spreading infectious diseases. [00240] In some instances, the testing may occur at the destination location. In some instances, the samples may be collected and/or loaded into the device at the destination location C. The device 1400c may be used to perform nucleic acid amplification on the sample at the destination location. The results may be delivered at the destination location. In other implementations, a vehicle 1420c may receive the device and depart the destination location. The vehicle may be on its way to another location A, such as a lab or facility. The device may be capable of performing nucleic acid amplification in the vehicle while the vehicle is in operation. The device may be capable of performing nucleic acid amplification while the vehicle is in transit. The device may be powered by the vehicle to perform the nucleic acid amplification. In some instances, after the samples have been loaded into the device at a location C, the vehicle may make its way to another location. The amplification may occur and/or be completed while the vehicle is in transit. This may save time in getting the device to another location where it may be needed. The results may be detected with aid of an on-board detector. The results may be relayed to a user of the device in realtime. The results may be relayed back to the location C from which the samples were collected. In some instances, the results may be relayed to a facility 1410 which may perform additional analysis. [00241] Powering the device using the vehicle, and permitting nucleic acid amplification and detection while the device is in the vehicle en route may provide greater flexibility and time saving measures. The vehicle transit time may be used, rather than being 'down time.' This may aid in maximizing or improving the use of the device when the device is deployed to different locations. [00242] In some instances, a device 1400d may be transported to a destination D with aid of a vehicle 1420d. The vehicle may be capable of being powered and/or charged using the vehicle. The device may be used at the destination. A sample may be collected at the destination from a subject. The device may perform a nucleic acid amplification of the sample at the destination and/or en route from the destination to another location. The device may be powered using the vehicle while performing the nucleic acid amplification. The device may be powered using another power source while performing the nucleic acid amplification. For example, the other power source may be another off-grid power source, or an on-grid power source. In some instances, the device may be powered using an energy storage device while performing the nucleic acid amplification. The energy storage device may have been charged using the vehicle or another source. The device may perform nucleic acid amplification within a vehicle. The vehicle may be in operation while the nucleic acid amplification is occurring. The vehicle may or may not be in transit while the nucleic acid amplification is occurring. Real-time detection may be occurring while the nucleic acid amplification is occurring. [00243] Any of the devices 1400a, 1400b, 1400c, 1400d may have any characteristics of the devices as described elsewhere herein. For example, any of the devices may include a thermal cycler and a detector. The detector may be capable of performing real-time monitoring of the nucleic acid amplification. The device may be capable of operating on low voltage power. For example, the devices may be capable of operating at 12 V or less, or any other voltage level described elsewhere herein. [00244] In some embodiments, a carrying container may be provided for the devices described elsewhere herein. For example, the carrying container may be a suitcase or any other type of container. The carrying container may be configured to hold one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or more nucleic acid amplification devices. The carrying container may be capable of being lifted by a human being. The carrying container may be capable of being carried by a human being using one hand. In some instances, the carrying container may be a suitcase with one or two handles. A human being may be able to lift a suitcase by holding a handle. In other implementations, any number of handles may be provided. [00245] The carrying container may have any dimensions. In some instances, one or more of a length, width, height, diagonal, and/or diameter of a carrying container may be less than or equal to about 1 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, 20 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm, 35 cm, 40 cm, 45 cm, 50 cm, 55 cm, 60 cm, 65 cm, 70 cm, 75 cm, 80 cm, 85 cm, 90 cm, 95 cm, 100 cm, 110 cm, 120 cm, or 150 cm. Alternatively, one or more dimensions of the carrying container may be greater than or equal to any of the dimensions described herein. One or more dimensions of the carrying container may fall into a range between any two of the values described herein. [00246] The carrying container may enclose one or more of the devices. In some instances, the devices may be partially or entirely enclosed within the carrying container. The carrying container may optionally have one or more compartments into which the devices may be inserted. For example, a plurality of devices or other components may be carried within a suitcase. The suitcase may have multiple compartments that may partially or completely isolate the devices or other components from one another. For example, separate compartments may be provided for one or more nucleic acid amplification devices. The compartments may be sized and/or shaped to accommodate the nucleic acid amplification devices and prevent them from moving around. [00247] The carrying container may also hold one or more battery packs therein. The battery packs may include battery packs that can be used to power the nucleic acid amplification devices. The battery packs may be stored within the carrying container with one or more devices. The battery packs and/or devices may be separated from one another. In some instances, one or more compartments may be provided within the suitcase to separate the battery packs from one another and/or from one or more devices. A carrying case may be provided with a compartment for the device and a compartment for the battery pack. Each compartment may be sized and/or shaped to accommodate their respective component. Components may or may not be swappable between different compartments. [00248] In some embodiments, a battery pack may be provided at a bottom portion of the carrying container. The battery pack may be provided along any edge, side, or surface of the carrying container. A plug-in component from a battery pack may be exposed. For example, when the carrying container is closed, the plug-in component from the battery pack may be exposed. Alternatively, plug-in component may be exposed only when the carrying container is opened. A device may be plugged into the plug-in component of the battery pack for the battery pack to be able to power the device. In one example, the device may be removed from the carrying container and then plugged into a battery pack that is also removed from the carrying container. In another example, the device may be removed from the carrying container and plugged into a battery pack that remains within the carrying container (when the carrying container is opened or is closed). In another example, the device and the battery pack may remain within the carrying container and may be electrically connected to one another. [00249] The carrying container may be able to accommodate any other components. For example, the suitcase may hold small equipment for sample processing and sample storage. For example, the suitcase may hold a dry bath and/or a centrifuge. Each of the components may be stored in separate compartments in the suitcase or may be stored together. [00250] In some embodiments, the compartments of the carrying container may be formed from or lined with a resilient material. The material may cushion the components (which may include the device and/or battery back therein) which may help protect the components. The carrying container may be formed from a rigid or hard exterior. Alternatively, the exterior may be resilient or soft. [00251] The carrying container may aid in transport of the device and associated components. The carrying container may enable the device, battery pack, and/or any other components to be easily transported together. Rather than needing to carry and keep track of separate components, the carrying container may simplify transport of the various components. Since the device may be deployed to remote areas, the carrying container may facilitate the transport and help protect the device and components. [00252] It should be understood from the foregoing that, while particular implementations have been illustrated and described, various modifications can be made thereto and are contemplated herein. It is also not intended that the invention be limited by the specific examples provided within the specification.
