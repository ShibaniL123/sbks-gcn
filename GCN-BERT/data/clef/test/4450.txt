TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to cosmetic pigments, their production method, and cosmetics containing the cosmetic pigments, which cosmetic pigments are suitable to be contained in makeup products such as foundations, eyeshadow and lipsticks or basic skin care such as sunscreen products, emulsions and creams. BACKGROUND ART Conventionally, pigments whose surfaces are coated with various types of compounds have been used as pigments to be contained in makeup products such as foundations, eyeshadow and blushers or basic skin care such as sunscreen products, emulsions and creams with a view to improve waterproofness and avoid coming off of makeup or to improve feeling of the pigments and so forth. Here, coating pigment surfaces with a silicone compound or a fluorine compound has been known as a means of improving the waterproofness (see Patent Documents 1 and 2). Cosmetic pigments whose surfaces are coated with the silicone compound or fluorine compound excel in avoiding coming off of makeup and contribute to long-lasting makeup because waterproofness is imparted to them. However, there are some problems that they give a dried out and less moist feeling owing to the compounds, and skin adhesion becomes poor because they have less affinity to a biological body. Meanwhile, coating pigment surfaces with collagen has been known as a means of improving feeling of the pigments (see Patent Document 3). However, since the collagen is an animal protein, there is a limit in the use of it, which is a problem. Recently, due to the increasing popularity of natural products among consumers, cosmetics using compounds derived from natural products are greatly desired, and development of cosmetics which are human-body friendly having good skin adhesion and which provide good feeling are strongly desired. Surfactants (biosurfactants) such as glucolipids are said to have great biodegradability and low toxicity and they are environmentally-friendly. Therefore, applying them to a food industry, cosmetic industry, drug industry, chemical industry, environmental field etc. has been considered. However, existing biosurfactants have poor hydrophobicity, so that they are not suitable for cosmetic pigments. Meanwhile, although mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL) has been known, for use in skin care, as having curative properties against skin roughness because it can easily form a lamellar structure, there has been no report that it is used as cosmetic pigments. PRIOR LITERATURES [Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-119741 [Patent Document 2] Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-2524 [Patent Document 3] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. Sho 61-69710 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention The present invention is made in view of the above problems and an object of the present invention is to provide cosmetic pigments that are human-body friendly with good skin adhesion and that provide good feeling, their production method, and cosmetics containing such cosmetic pigments which provide fresh and enriched feeling accordingly. Means of Solving the Problems In order to achieve the above object, the present invention tries to obtain novel functional pigments and cosmetics by coating pigment surfaces with mannosylerythritol lipid, i.e., glucolipids produced by yeasts etc., that is derived from olive oil and the like. In summary, the first invention is directed to cosmetic pigments whose surfaces are coated with mannosylerythritol lipid, which is glucolipids, consisting of mannose, sugar alcohol and a fatty acid as shown in the general expression (1) below: (Note: In the general expression, R1 and R2 denote aliphatic acyl group with carbon numbers 6 through 20, which can be either same or different. R3 and R4 denote hydrogen or acetyl group, which can be either same or different. n denotes an integer in the range of 2 to 4.) The second invention is directed to a method of producing the cosmetic pigments characterized in that the pigment surfaces are coated with mannosylerythritol lipid shown in the above general expression (1) by dissolving or dispersing mannosylerythritol lipid in an organic solvent, agitatedly mixing the compound liquid with the pigments, then removing the organic solvent. The third invention is directed to cosmetics containing the cosmetic pigments according to the first invention. In the fourth invention, cosmetics according to the third invention are either one of powder foundations, water-in-oil foundations, water-in-oil sunscreens or lip primers. Effect of the Invention Since mannosylerythritol lipid according to the first and second inventions is derived from natural products such as olive oil and soy oil, it is safe to a human body. In addition, since mannosylerythritol lipid for coating the surfaces of the pigments is an amphipathic compound having both hydrophobicity deriving from lipid property and hydrophilicity deriving from a property of sugar, it has a structure similar to a ceramide that constitutes the sebum membrane of a human. Although conventional biosurfactants are not suitable for cosmetic pigments as they have poor hydrophobicity, mannosylerythritol lipid according to the present invention can provide pigments with water-resistant property so that the conventional problem can be solved. Cosmetic pigments with good skin adhesion which also provide fresh and enriched feeling and excel in stability of such effects can be thus obtained. Also, since the cosmetics according to the third and fourth inventions contain the cosmetic pigments according to the first invention, they have excellent skin adhesion and skin affinity and ensure the high-safeness. In addition, thanks to the hydrophobicity effect deriving from the lipid property, it becomes possible to provide the pigments with the water-resistant property, which contributes to long-lasting makeup. Furthermore, because of a moisturizing effect of the hydrophilicity deriving from the property of sugar, cosmetics with fresh and enriched feeling can be obtained. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Next, concrete description of preferred embodiments of the cosmetic pigments, their production method and cosmetics containing the cosmetic pigments according to the present invention will be made. Mannosylerythritol lipid (often referred to hereinafter as “MEL”) in the present invention is glucolipids consisting of mannose, sugar alcohol and a fatty acid as shown in the general expression (1) below: (Note: In the general expression, R1 and R2 denote aliphatic acyl group with carbon numbers 6 through 20, which can be either same or different. R3 and R4 denote hydrogen or acetyl group, which can be either same or different. n denotes an integer in the range of 2 to 4.) MEL is a material found from Ustilago nuda and Shizonella melanogramma. Later, it is known that MEL can be produced by yeasts such as Candida yeast that is an itaconic acid producing mutated strain, Candida antarctia (currently called as Pseudozyma antarctica), and Kurtzmanomyces yeast. There are various kinds of MELs according to presence or absence of the acetyl group added to the mannose residues R3, R4 in the above general expression (1); kinds of sugar alcohol that are glycosidically-bound to the mannose; or isomeric forms of the sugar alcohol. Mannosylerythritol lipids that are suitable for the present invention are as follows: MEL-A having a structure shown in the below general expression (2); MEL-B having a structure shown in the below general expressions (3) or (4); MEL-C having a structure shown in the below general expression (5) and MEL-D having a structure shown in the below general expressions (6) or (7). Among them, the MEL-A produced by Pseudozyma antarctica having the structure shown in the general expression (2) and the MEL-B produced by Pseudozyma tsukubaensis having the structure shown in the general expression (4) are particularly suitable. The general expressions (2), (3), (5) and (6) below have 4-O-β-O-mannopyranosyl-(2S,3R)-erythritol structure. Meanwhile, a term “inverted” is used for distinguishing MELs in which an optical isomer exists. In the present invention, compounds having 4-O-β-D-mannopyranosyl-meso (2R,3S)-erythritol structure are inverted as shown in the below general expressions (4) and (7). (Substituent groups R1 and R2 in the general expressions (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) denote aliphatic acyl group with carbon numbers 6 through 20, which can be either same or different.) Although one of the aforementioned MEL-A to MEL-D may be used as a mannosylerythritol lipid, two types or more of mannosylerythritol lipids may be used in combination. As pigments to be coated with the glucolipids that is shown in the above general expression (1), various, existing known pigments may be used regardless of their forms (spherical, bar-like, needle-like, plate-like, infinite, scale-like, spindle-shaped etc.), particle sizes (haze particles, fine particles, as small as pigment class etc.), or particle structures (porous, imperforate etc.).

Manufacturing Embodiment 1 Embodiment of Manufacturing MEL-A, MEL-B and MEL-C To obtain an inoculum, one loop of colonies of Pseudozyma antarctica NBRC 10736 (obtained from: NITE Biological Resource Center) is inoculated in a seed medium (20 ml/500 ml Sakaguchi flask). It is then cultivated overnight at 30 degrees Celsius. The culture medium thus obtained is used as an inoculum. The composition of the seed medium is 4 W/V % Glucose, 0.3 W/V % NaNO3, 0.02 W/V % MgSO4.7H2O, 0.02 W/V % KH2PO4, and 0.1 W/V % yeast extract. 75 ml of the above inoculum is inoculated in 1.5 L (5-litter Jar) of a production medium and culturing is done under the following condition: 30 degrees Celsius, 300 rpm (stirrer rotation) and 0.5 L/min (Air), using a 5-litter Jar. The composition of the production medium is 3 W/V % soy oil, 0.02 W/V % MgSO4.7H2O, 0.02 W/V % KH2PO4, and 0.1 W/V % yeast extract. 250 ml of the culture medium is subjected to centrifugation (6500 rpm, 30 min) to remove supernatant and collect a deposition (yeast cells). Added to the deposition is 50 ml of ethyl acetate. After enough stirring, centrifugation (8500 rpm, 30 min) is conducted to obtain supernatant and a deposition. The supernatant is concentrated by an evaporator. It is then eluted with chloroform-acetone (1:0), chloroform-acetone (9:1), chloroform-acetone (1:1), chloroform-acetone (3:7), chloroform-acetone (0:1) by use of silica gel to yield MEL-A, MEL-B and MEL-C fractions. MEL-A, MEL-B and MEL-C contained in the purified fractions respectively has the structure of the above-mentioned general expression (2), general expression (3) and general expression (5). Although soy oil is used in the above method, MELs can be obtained by the similar method using olive oil. Manufacturing Embodiment 2 Embodiment of Manufacturing Inverted MEL-B 0.2 ml of a frozen stock of Pseudozyma tsukubaensis is inoculated in 20 ml of YM culture medium (1 W/V % glucose, 0.3 W/V % yeast extract, 0.5 W/V % polypeptone, 0.3 W/V % malt extract, pH5.6) in a 500-ml Sakaguchi flask. It is then cultivated overnight at 26 degrees Celsius with 180 rpm to obtain mother inoculum. 0.2 ml of the mother inoculum is again inoculated in 20 ml of YM culture medium in a 500-ml Sakaguchi flask, which is then cultivated overnight at 26 degrees Celsius with 180 rpm to obtain an inoculum. 20 ml of the inoculum is inoculated in 2 L of YM culture medium containing 15 W/V % olive oil in a 5-litter Jar. It is then cultivated for eight days at 26 degrees Celsius with 300 rpm (¼VVM, 0.5 L·air/min). The culture medium is subjected to centrifugation (7900 rpm, 60 min, 4 degrees Celsius) to separate yeast cells (including MEL-B) from supernatant. 80 ml of ethyl acetate is added to each of the yeast fractions, which is then stirred vertically so that the yeast cells are suspended sufficiently. After that, it is subjected to centrifugation (7900 rpm, 30 min, 4 degrees Celsius). Added to the obtained supernatant is saturated brine in equal amount, which is then stirred to obtain an ethyl acetate layer. A proper amount of anhydrous sodium sulphate is added to the ethyl acetate layer and it is left to stand for 30 minutes and evaporated to obtain a crude product of MEL-B. The crude product of MEL-B is eluted with hexane-acetone (5:1), hexane-acetone (1:1) by use of silica gel column to yield a purified MEL-B fraction. MEL-B contained in this purified fraction has the structure of the above-mentioned general expression (4). Although olive oil is used in the above method, MELs can be obtained by the similar method using soy oil. Manufacturing Embodiment 3 Embodiment of Manufacturing MEL-C 0.2 ml of a frozen stock of Pseudozyma hubeiensis is inoculated in 20 ml of YM culture medium in a 500-ml Sakaguchi flask.

It is then cultivated for eight days at 26 degrees Celsius with 300 rpm (¼VVM, 0.5 L·air/min). The culture medium is subjected to centrifugation (7900 rpm, 60 min, 4 degrees Celsius) to separate yeast cells (including MEL-C) from supernatant. 80 ml of ethyl acetate is added to each of the yeast fractions, which is then stirred vertically so that the yeast cells are suspended sufficiently. After that, it is subjected to centrifugation (7900 rpm, 30 min, 4 degrees Celsius). Added to the obtained supernatant is saturated brine in equal amount, which is then stirred to obtain an ethyl acetate layer. A proper amount of anhydrous sodium sulphate is added to the ethyl acetate layer and it is left to stand for 30 minutes and evaporated to obtain a crude product of MEL-C. The crude product of MEL-C is eluted with heptane-ethyl acetate (1:1), heptane-ethyl acetate (1:2), heptane-ethyl acetate (1:3) by use of silica gel column to yield a purified MEL-C fraction. MEL-C contained in this purified fraction has the structure of the above-mentioned general expression (5).

After reaction, it is extracted and concentrated with ethyl acetate, and a product is isolated with ethyl acetate:methanol (10:1) by use of 20 g of silica gel to obtain 100 mg of a colorless oil product. MEL-D contained in this purified fraction has the structure of the above-mentioned general expression (6). Manufacturing Embodiment 6 Embodiment of Manufacturing Inverted MEL-D Using 1 g of inverted MEL-B manufactured in the above Embodiment 2, a reaction is caused in a same fashion as in the Manufacturing Embodiment 5. After that purification is conducted to obtain 95 mg of a colorless oil product. Inverted MEL-D contained in this purified fraction has the structure of the above-mentioned general expression (7). Manufacturing Embodiment 7 Embodiment of Manufacturing Mannosylerythritol Lipid-Coated Titanium Oxide After 1000 g of titanium oxide is put in a Henschel mixer, a drop of a solution in which 10.3 g of MEL-A (solid content 98.2 percent by mass of product) is dissolved in 125 g of isopropyl alcohol is mixed so that the titanium oxide is well mixed with it. Thereafter, heating and decompression are applied in the Henschel mixer to remove the ethanol. Pigment powder is taken out from the mixer, crushed and subjected to heat treatment. The titanium oxide is thus obtained whose surface is coated with 1 percent by mass of glucolipids derived from olive oil which comprises fatty acid, mannose and erythritol. By similar processes, sericite, talc, mica, red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide and black iron oxide are each subjected to the surface coating treatment to prepare respective samples. Surface coating treatments using MEL-B, inverted MEL-B, MEL-C, MEL-D and inverted MEL-D are also conducted in the same way to prepare samples.

They evaluated the specimens with respect to moisturizing feeling, skin adhesion and impression from use in a questionnaire format in such a way that 0 point is given if an evaluation is bad, 5 point is given if an evaluation is good. Evaluation result is obtained by taking the average point given by the subjects. Therefore, the higher the point is, the higher evaluation the specimens get. For evaluating temporal stability of the specimens, they are put into ordinary cosmetic containers and stored for three months at 40 degrees Celsius under natural living light. The condition is evaluated visually by the following criteria: ⊚: The condition remains the same. ◯: Some separation occurred. x: Separation occurred. The evaluation result is shown in the table 2 below: TABLE 2 Mois- Impres- Treatment turinzing Skin sion Temporal type feeling adhesion from use stability Example 7 MEL-A 4.8 4.8 4.5 ⊚ Example 8 MEL-B 5 4.8 4.9 ⊚ Example 9 Inverted 5 4.8 4.9 ⊚ MEL-B Example 10 MEL-C 4.8 4.6 4.6 ◯ Example 11 MEL-D 4 4.8 4.9 ⊚ Example 12 Inverted 4.1 4.2 4.8 ⊚ MEL-D Comparative Untreated 1.6 1.3 1 X Example 2 Comparative Silicone- 1 2 0.6 X Example 3 treated As obvious from the table 2, the water-in-oil foundations which use surface coated pigments (cosmetic pigments) of the present invention excel in all of the moisturizing feeling, skin adhesion and impression from use. They also excel in the temporal stability. The specimens in the comparative examples separated in two layers because they do not contain a surfactant, and they are inferior in all of the moisturizing feeling, skin adhesion, impression from use and temporal stability. Since the water-in-oil foundations obtained in the examples 7 to 12 excel in skin barrier function and water retention capacity, they provide skins with freshness and moisture.
