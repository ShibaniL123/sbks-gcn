(N-(8-((3,4,6-O-triacetyl-2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-β-D-galactopyranosyl)oxy)-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl)-3-(((4,4',4″-trimethoxytrityl)oxy)methyl)azetidin-3-yl)methyl (2-cyanoethyl) diisopropylphosphoramidite 14k
Compound 10k (0.675 g, 0.73 mmol) and 2-cyanoethyl N,N,N',N'-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite (0.286 g, 0.95 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (15 mL), and the mixture was shaken with flame-dried molecular sieves 4 Å for 1 h. This was cooled to −10° C., 1H-tetrazole (0.45M, 0.365 mmol, 0.81 mL) in acetonitrile was added, and the mixture was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was quenched with triethylamine (0.5 mL) and was diluted with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The product was extracted with DCM, and the organic extract was dried over Na2SO4 and was evaporated to dryness. The crude product was purified on a silica gel column (5% Et3N, 20-80% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to yield 14k (0.692 g, 84.2%) as a white solid foam.
