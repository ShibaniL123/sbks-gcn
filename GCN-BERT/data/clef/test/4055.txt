Comparative Example 9: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monomesylate
2-propanol solution (27.11 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (2.97 g: 23.5 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and mesylic acid (2.28 g: 23.7 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monomesylate (4.46 g: 20.1 mmol, yield=85%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 156° C.
