The compounds according to the present invention have an affinity for the p75NTR neurotrophin receptor. Neurotrophins belong to a family of proteins of which the biological effect is in particular cell survival and differentiation. The p75NTR receptor, which is the receptor for all neurotrophins, is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the tumoral necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (W.J. Friedman and L.A. Greene, Exp. Cell. Res., 1999,253, 131-142). The p75NTR receptor is expressed in several cell types, and several biological functions have been attributed to said receptor: firstly, modulation of the affinity of neurotrophins for receptor tyrosine kinases (trk); secondly, in the absence of trk, induction of a signal for cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, the neurotrophin precursors, proneurotrophins, are capable of binding to p75NTR with a high affinity, and are considered to be powerful inducers of p75NTR-dependent apoptosis in neurons and certain cell lines. At the level of the central nervous system, many studies show that apoptosis is involved in several pathological conditions, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and prion diseases. p75NTR is also known to be overexpressed in various types of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Longo F.M. et al., Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2007; 4: 503-506; Lowry K.S. et al., Amyotroph. Lateral. Scler. Other. Motor. Neuron. Disord. 2001; 2:127-34). Results suggest that p75NTR may play a predominant role in the mechanisms resulting in post-ischaemic apoptotic neuron death (Ρ.Ρ. Roux et al., J. Neurosci., 1999, 19, 6887- 6896). Results (V. Della-Bianca et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276: 38929-33), (S. Rabizadeh et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1994,91, 10703-10706) support the hypothesis that p75NTR plays an important role in neuron death induced by the infectious prion protein (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) or by beta-amyloid protein (Alzheimer’s disease). The p75NTR receptor is also associated with the Nogo receptor and involved in the signalling of the inhibitory effects of these myelin proteins with respect to axon growth. As a result, the p75NTR receptor plays a major role in the regulation of neuronal plasticity and in neuron-glia interactions and thus represents a therapeutic target of choice for promoting nerve regeneration. Beyond the nervous system and neurodegenerative diseases, it has been suggested that p75NTR could play a role in cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and myocardial ischaemia (M.L. Bochaton-Pialat et al., Am. J. Pathol., 1995,146, 1-6; Η. Perlman, Circulation, 1997, 95, 981-987). Recent studies show an increase in the expression of p75NTR and of neurotrophins, and massive apoptosis in atherosclerosis lesions. Several studies also suggest that p75NTR is an inflammation mediator (Rihl Μ. et al., Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2005; 64(11): 1542-9; Raychaudhuri S.P. et al., Prog. Brain. Res. 2004; 146: 433-7, Tokuoka S. et al., Br.J. Pharmacol. 2001, 134: 1580-1586). p75NTR is also described as playing an important role in inflammatory pain. Specifically, nerve damage appears to selectively increase the expression and the axonal transport of p75NTR, implicated in the induction of neuropathic pain. Furthermore, the use of a p75NTR-specific antibody or of oligodeoxynucleotide antisense capable of blocking the activity of the receptor in vivo appears to be capable of reversing neuropathic pain (heat and cold hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia) induced in rats after lesion of the L5 spinal nerve (Obata Κ. et al., J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11974-11986). An anti-p75NTR neutralizing antibody considerably reduces inflammatory pain induced by the injection of an adjuvant into the plantar arch in mice, and also in a model of sciatic nerve crush in mice (Watanabe Τ. et al., J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 3566-357; Fukui Υ. et al. J Orthop Res. 2010; 28(3): 279-83). The expression of p75NTR is also described in chronic pancreatitis, with implication in the apoptotic process of the exocrine and endocrine pancreas (Zhu Ζ. et al., Dig. Dis. Sci. 2003; 48 (4): 717-25). Other reports have also described the importance of p75NTR in the development of hepatic fibrosis (Kendall T.J. et al., Hepatology. 2009; 49 (3): 901-10). p75NTR also plays an essential role in tumour biology. Many compounds are known to interact with the trkA/NGF/p75NTR system or to have an NGF-type (nerve growth factor) activity. Thus, patent application WO 00/59893 describes substituted pyrimidine derivatives which have an NGF-type activity and/or which increase the activity of NGF on PC12 cells.

In the subsequent text, the term “protective group Pg” is intended to mean a group which makes it possible, firstly, to protect a reactive function such as a hydroxyl or an amine during a synthesis and, secondly, to regenerate the intact reactive function at the end of synthesis. Examples of protective groups and also methods of protection and of deprotection are given in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Green et al., 2nd Edition (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York). In accordance with the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) are prepared according to the process which follows. More specifically, the process for preparing the compounds of general formula (I) in which R, R1, X, Χ1, Χ2, Υ, W, R2, m and η are as defined above for formula (I) comprises the reaction of a compound of formula (II): in which R, R1, X, Χ1, Χ2, Υ, m and η are defined as in general formula (I) and Hal represents a halogen atom, for example chlorine; and of a compound of general formula (III): H-W-R2 (HI) in which W and R2 are defined as in general formula (I), according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example in the presence of a base, in a solvent as described in WO 03/104225. Thus, by way of base, mention may be made of organic bases such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylamine, diisopropylethylamine (DPEA) or Νmethylmorpholine or alkali metal carbonates or bicarbonates such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate and in the absence or in the presence of an alkali metal iodide such as potassium iodide or sodium iodide. The reaction is carried out in a solvent such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), Νmethylpyrrolidinone, toluene or propan-2-ol, and at a temperature between ambient temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent. The “ambient temperature” is intended to mean a temperature between 5 and 25°C. By way of example, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of sodium bicarbonate and of sodium iodide in a solvent such as DMF. These reactions can also be carried out in a microwave reactor. In the compounds of general formula (I) thus obtained, R, R1, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 can be modified by treatments commonly used by those skilled in the art, for instance by hydrolysis of an ester group so as to give a carboxylic group or of a cyano so as to obtain a tetrazole group. Generally, the acid addition salts of the compounds of general formula (I) can be obtained by addition of the appropriate acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or oxalic acid. The compounds of formula (III), optionally in the form of salts, can be prepared from the corresponding compounds of the formula (VIII): Pg-W-R2 (VIM) in which W and R2 are as defined in formula (I) and Pg represents a protective group for a nitrogen atom of W. Preferably, Pg is a benzyl group and the deprotection is carried out according to conventional methods well known to those skilled in the art, for example by catalytic hydrogenation on Pd/C or by treatment with chloroformates followed by hydrolysis in an acid medium. The compounds of formula (VIII) can be prepared from the compounds of formula (VI): Pg-W-H (VI) and (VII): Hal-R2 (VII) in which Pg, W and R2 are defined as above and Hal represents a halogen atom, preferably chlorine. This reaction is generally carried out under the same conditions as the reaction for preparing the compounds of formula (I) from the compounds of formulae (II) and (III). Alternatively, the compounds of formula (VIII) can be prepared by the Buchwald coupling method in the presence of a palladium catalyst and of an opportunely chosen phosphine, using, as solvent, inert solvents such as toluene or xylene, at a temperature between ambient temperature and 110°C. In the compounds of general formula (VIII) thus obtained, R7 and R8 can be modified by treatments commonly used by those skilled in the art, for instance the synthesis of an oxadiazole group from a cyano group, or else by Suzuki couplings as described in the scheme below.

Cell culture: The SH-SY-5Y strain (human neuroblastoma) is cultured conventionally in a DMEM culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) (Gibco BRL, France) containing FCS (5%) (foetal calf serum) (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and glutamine (4 mM) in culture flasks coated with collagen (Becton Dickinson, France). The SK-N-BE parent strain (human neuroblastoma) and the Β℮ρ 75 clone, stably expressing the whole form of the human p75NTR receptor (SK-N-BE Β℮ρ 75) are cultured conventionally in an RPMI culture medium containing FCS (5%), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) and glutamine (4 mM). For the SK-N-BE Β℮ρ 75 cells, hygromycin (200 μΐ/20 ml of medium) is added as selection agent. Study of the dimerization of the p75NTR receptor independently of its ligand. The p75NTR receptor dimerization study is carried out on a cell suspension of the SK-N-BE Β℮ρ 75 strain. The cells (2.5 χ 104 cells/well) are placed in wells (96-well plate) for 24 h, and then preincubated for 1 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of the compounds according to the invention. Supernatant is then added, this supernatant being derived from the culture of ΗΕΚ293 human cells of renal origin expressing, after 48 h of transfection, and secreting a soluble form of the p75NTR receptor (extracellular part of the receptor) coupled to an alkaline phosphatase, at the final concentration of 10 ηΜ. The quantification of the specific binding of the soluble p75NTR receptor to the receptor present on SK-N-BE Β℮ρ 75 cells is determined by measuring the alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity after incubation of the cells for 1 hour at 37°C in the presence of the supernatant. After filtration and transfer of the filters into 24-well plates, the alkaline phosphatase activity is determined by adding CDP-Star chemiluminescent substrate (ready-to-use, Roche). The concentrations inhibiting 50%(CI50) of the dimerization of the p75NTR receptor, of the compounds according to the invention, are low and range from 10"6 to 10" 11M. For example, compounds No. 9, 11, 19 and 24 showed an IC50 of 0.73 ηΜ, 1.9 ηΜ, 14 ηΜ and 1.55 ηΜ, respectively. Measurement of apoptosis The cells (human neuroblastoma strains SH-SY-5Y and SK-N-BE Β℮ρ 75) are placed in 35 mm diameter Petri dishes (Biocoat collagen I, (105 cells/well)) in an appropriate culture medium containing 5% of FCS, for 24 h. The culture medium is then removed, the cells are rinsed with PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate buffered saline), and then either fresh medium containing 5% of FCS or medium containing NGF (at the concentration of 10 ng/ml), or beta-amyloid peptide (Αβ1-40) (at the concentration of 10 μΜ) is added, this being in the presence or absence of the compounds according to the invention. The degrees of apoptosis are measured 48 hours after the treatments in the case of the SH-SY-5Y strain, and 24 hours after in the case of the SK-N-BE Β℮ρ 75 strain, by quantification of the DNA fragment-associated cytoplasmic histones (cell death detection ELISA, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). The degrees of apoptosis are expressed as amount of oligonucleosomes/105 cells. Each value corresponds to the mean of 9 experimental points distributed over 3 independent experiments. The compounds of formula (I) exhibit an inhibitory activity on NGF-induced apoptosis, with IC50 values which range from 10"6 to 10"11M. For example, compounds No. 9 and 11 showed an IC50 of 0.72 ηΜ and 4.46 ηΜ, respectively. Thus, the binding of the compounds according to the invention to the p75NTR receptor results, on the one hand, at the biochemical level, in the inhibition of the dimerization of the receptor induced by neurotrophins, or independently of the ligand, and, on the other hand, at the cellular level, in the inhibition of the proapoptotic effect mediated by the p75NTR receptor. Thus, according to one of the subjects of the present invention, the compounds of formula (I) exhibit a very advantageous activity of inhibition of the dimerization of the p75NTR receptor, independently of its ligand. The compounds according to the invention can therefore be used for the preparation of medicaments, in particular of medicaments for use in preventing or treating any pathological condition where the p75NTR receptor is involved, more particularly those indicated hereinafter. The compounds according to the invention can also be used for preventing or treating any pathological condition where the p75NTR receptor is involved, more particularly those indicated hereinafter. Thus, according to another of its aspects, a subject of the invention is medicaments which comprise a compound of formula (I), or an addition salt of the latter with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Thus, the compounds according to the invention can be used, in humans or in animals, in the treatment or prevention of various p75NTR-dependent conditions, such as central and peripheral neurodegenerative diseases, for instance senile dementia, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s chorea, Down’s syndrome, prion diseases, amnesia, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis; cardiovascular conditions, for instance post-ischaemic cardiac damage, cardiomyopathies, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac ischaemia, cerebral infarction; peripheral neuropathies (of diabetic, traumatic or iatrogenic origin); damage to the optic nerve and to the retina (retinal pigment degeneration, glaucoma); retinal ischaemia; macular degeneration; spinal cord traumas and cranial traumas; atherosclerosis; stenoses; cicatrization disorders; alopecia.
