Intermediate 9: 1,6-Diamino-2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate
Step A: 6-Chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-amine. Nine separate sealed tubes, each containing a mixture of 2,6-dichloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (10.0g, 46.3 mmol) and ammonium hydroxide (91 g, 100 mL, 2600 mmol) were stirred at 100Â° C. for 12 h. After cooling to rt, the contents of all of the sealed tubes were combined and the solvents were concentrated in vacuo. Purification of the (FCC, SiO2; 5-20% EtOAc/petroleum ether) afforded the title compound as a colorless oil (57 g, 66%), which solidified upon standing.
