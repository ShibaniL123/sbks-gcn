Preparation of Compound XI
To a 250 mL, three necks, round bottom flask, equipped with the stir bar, thermocouple and nitrogen sweep, was charged 5.0 g of 4-isobutoxybenzonitrile (FW: 175.23, 28.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), 9.37 g of cesium carbonate (FW: 325.82, 28.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), followed by 50 mL (10 vol.) of DMSO and 5 mL (1 vol.) of DI water. After heating to 95° C., 4.9 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (FW: 34, 48.5 mmol, 1.7 equiv.) was charged in 20 minutes. HPLC analysis indicated the reaction completed instantly after charging. The batch was cooled down to room temperature and diluted with 100 mL of DI water (20 vol.). The product precipitated, and collected by vacuum filtration. The filter cake was washed with 50 mL of DI water (10 vol), and dried in the Buchner funnel with nitrogen sweep for 1 hour before transferring into vacuum oven, drying at 80° C. under full house vacuum for 20 hours. This afforded 5.147 g of 4-isobutoxybenzamide as a white solid, representing a 93.6% yield in 99.8 A % purity.
