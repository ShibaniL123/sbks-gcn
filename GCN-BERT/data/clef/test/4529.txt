CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional patent application No. 61/576,649, filed Dec. 16, 2011. The content of the above-noted patent application is hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the detailed description hereof. FIELD This specification relates to a process for preparation of 3-((2S,5S)-4-methylene-5-(3-oxopropyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)propanol derivatives and intermediates useful thereof. BACKGROUND Halinchondrin analogs have been disclosed as having anti-cancer and antimitotic activity (U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,865, incorporated herein by reference). In particular, Halichondrin B has been reported as a potent anticancer agent that was first isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai (U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,865; WO 2005/118565 A1 and WO 2009/124237 A1, all incorporated herein by reference). 2,5-disubstituted (2S,5S)-3-methylene-tetrahydrofurans, such as the compound of formula 7a, can be an important building block for the synthesis of the halichondrin natural products and derivatives, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,214,865 and 5,436,238, and incorporated herein by reference. wherein Piv is (CH3)3C—C(═O)—. The synthesis of compounds, similar to the compound of formula 7a, has been described by Kishi (Pure Appl. Chem. 2003, 75, 1-17; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 15642-15646; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 15636-15641), Phillips (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2009, 48, 2346) and Burke (Org. Lett. 2002, 4, 3411-3414, J. Org. Chem. 2003, 68, 1150-1153), all incorporated herein by reference. However, these methods can be undesirable for commercial manufacturing. For example, all these routes rely on asymmetric reactions that, despite their high degree of selectivity, can give rise to epimers, which are of particular concern in cases where the intended use of the molecule is in the manufacture of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Furthermore, many of these asymmetric reactions employ chiral ligands that are not necessarily easily commercially available, and which can be a hindrance for large scale production. There is a need in the art for a process for preparation of 3-((2S,5S)-4-methylene-5-(3-oxopropyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)propanol (7a), and its analogs (7), that can be used in the preparation of halichondrin natural products, its derivatives and analogs, such as, for example and without limitation, eribulin, the compounds described in recent publication of S. Narayan and others (Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry letters, 2011, 1630-1633; Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry letters, 2011, 1634-1638, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry letters, 2011, 1639-1643), and other eribulin analogs with modified side chains on position C32 of eribulin. In addition, there is a need in the art for a process for preparation of 3-((2S,5S)-4-methylene-5-(3-oxopropyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)prop-1-yl pivaloate (7a), and its analogs (7), that can be prepared from commercially available starting material. Moreover, there is a need in the art for a process for the preparation of 3-((2S,5S)-4-methylene-5-(3-oxopropyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)prop-1-yl pivaloate (7a), and its analogs (7), that can avoid the use of asymmetric reactions, including chiral ligands. In addition, there is a need in the art for a process for preparation of 3-((2S,5S)-4-methylene-5-(3-oxopropyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)prop-1-yl pivaloate (7a), and its analogs (7), where the process is scalable and can lead to a product having high stereochemical purity.

The aldehyde functional group can be replaced by other groups, for example and without limitation, an ester, an amide or an acyl halide. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the nucleophillic addition of the allyl-silane derivative of formula 8 utilizes the stereochemical features of the compound of formula 4. In particular, the position of the isopropylidene protecting group on the 1,2-diol facilitates nucleophillic addition from the β-face, i.e. from behind the plane of the page, to form the compound of formula 5 having a trans configuration. Hence, the resulting product obtained can have high stereochemical purity (diastereomeric excess). The conditions for nucleophillic addition reaction of the compound of formula 4 with the compound of formula 8 are not particularly limited, and can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the nucleophillic addition reaction of the compound of formula 4 with the compound of formula 8 is performed in the presence of an activator. The activator used for such a nucleophillic addition reaction is also not particularly limited, and can be determined. Without being bound by a particular theory, in one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the activator can bind with the oxygen atoms on the compound of formula 4, which can increase the electrophilicity of the anomeric carbon centre on the compound of formula 4 and/or can assist in improving the facial selectivity of nucleophillic attack. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the activator is a lewis acid, for instance BF3 or trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf). The allyl-silane derivative of formula 8 used in the nucleophillic addition reaction is not particularly limited, and should be known to a skilled person, or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, in the allyl-silane derivative of formula 8, R1 is a alcohol protecting group, and each R2, R3 and R4 independently is an alkyl, cyclo-alkyl, aryl or hetero-aryl group.

In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the alkyl group is a C1-6 alkyl. Similar length of alkanediyl groups can also be used, where appropriate. In another embodiment, for example and without limitation, the aryl group is a C6-14 aryl. The term C1-6alkyl in accordance with the specification is not particularly limited and should be known to a person of skill in the art. The C1-6 alkyl may be, for example, and without limitation, any straight or branched alkyl, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, sec-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, i-pentyl, sec-pentyl, t-pentyl, n-hexyl, i-hexyl, 1,2-dimethylpropyl, 2-ethylpropyl, 1,2-dimethylbutyl, 1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl, 1,1,2-trimethylpropyl, 1,1-diethyl-2-methylbutyl, 1,1-dimethylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl or 3-methylpentyl. The term aryl in accordance with the specification is not particularly limited and should be known to a person of skill in the art. The term “aryl” refers to aromatic groups which have at least one ring having a conjugated π-electron system and includes carbocyclic aryl, heterocyclic aryl (also known as heteroaryl groups) and biaryl groups, all of which may be optionally substituted. The aryl groups can include, for example and without limitation, six to fourteen atoms. Examples of aryl group can include, without limitation, phenyl, pyridinyl or naphthyl. The conditions for the deprotection of the compound of formula 5 or 11 to remove the R1 protecting group is not particularly limited and would depend upon the particular R1 protecting group.

In the compound of formula 6, each R5 and R6 independently is an alkyl, cyclo-alkyl, aryl or hetero-aryl group, optionally having one or more heteroatoms, or R5 and R6 together form an alkanediyl group, optionally having one or more heteroatoms. In a further embodiment, for example and without limitation, the R5 and R6 together form —CH2CH2—. As shown above, the compound of formula 6 can be converted into the compound of formula 7 by replacing the hydroxyl group in the compound of formula 6 with a methylene group (similar conversation of compound of formula 5 leads to compound 11, an embodiment of which is shown below in Scheme 2), followed by deprotection of the aldehyde to form the compound of formula 7. The step of replacing the hydroxyl group in the compound of formula 6 with a methylene group is not particularly limited, and should be known to a skilled worker or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the hydroxyl group is oxidized to form a ketone (similar conversation of compound of formula 5 leads to compound 10, an embodiment of which is shown below in Scheme 2), followed by conversion of the ketone into an alkene. The oxidation of the alcohol in the compound of formula 5 or 6 is not particularly limited, and should be known to a skilled worker or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the oxidation is performed using a chromium-based reagent, such as Collins reagent, pyridinium dichromate (PDC) or pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC); activated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), such as, Swern oxidation, Moffatt oxidation or Doering oxidation; or hypervalent iodine compounds, such as, Dess-Martin periodinane or 2-iodoxybenzoic acid. In a further embodiment, for example and without limitation, the oxidation is performed by Doering oxidation, which uses DMSO and sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex. Following oxidation of the alcohol in the compound of formula 6 to a ketone, the ketone functional group can be, in one embodiment, for example and without limitation, converted into an alkene (similar conversation of compound of formula 10 leads to compound 11, an embodiment of which is shown below in Scheme 2). The reaction to convert a ketone to an alkene is not particularly limited, and should be known to a skilled worker or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the ketone is converted to an alkene using Tebbe's reagent, that has the formula (C5H5)2TiCH2ClAl(CH3)2. In another embodiment, for example and without limitation, a ketone can be converted into an alkene using the Peterson olefination, the Wittig reaction or the like. The protecting group PG1 used in the process for the preparation of compound 7 is not particularly limited, and should be known to a skilled worker or can be determined.

In a still further embodiment, for example and without limitation, the silyl protecting group formed is tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), tri-iso-propylsilyloxymethyl (TOM), or triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). In a particular embodiment, for example and without limitation, the protecting group PG1 is Piv. In one embodiment in accordance with the description, the compound of formula 4 can be obtained from 1,2:5,6-diisopropylidene glucose (compound of formula 1). The compound of formula 1 is derived from a natural sugar and therefore, can be readily available or can be prepared. Further, the compound of formula 1 can be present as a single stereoisomer. In addition, the reactions performed, as disclosed in the specification, can utilize the stereochemical features of the compound of formula 1 to form a single stereoisomer, resulting in products having high stereochemical purity. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the hydroxyl group of the compound of formula 1 is converted into a leaving group (LG), followed by hydrolysis of the 5,6-isopropylidene protecting group and oxidatively cleaving the diol to form the aldehyde of formula 2. A leaving group as disclosed herein is a molecular fragment or stable species that can be detached from a molecule in a bond-breaking step. The leaving group, in accordance with the specification, is not particularly limited and should be known to a person of skill in the art or can be determined. The ability of a leaving group to depart is correlated with the pKa of the conjugate acid, with lower pKa being associated with better leaving group ability. Examples of leaving group include, without limitation, halide or a sulfonate. Halides can include, for example, Cl, Br or I. Examples of sulfonates can include, without limitation, nonaflate, triflate, fluorosulfonate, tosylate, mesylate or besylate. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the leaving group is mesylate. The conditions for hydrolysis of the 5,6-isopropylidene protecting group is not particularly limited, and should be known to skilled worker or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the 5,6-isopropylidene protecting group is removed using an acid, to yield a diol. The diol can then be oxidatively cleaved to form the aldehyde. The process for oxidative cleavage of the diol is not particularly limited, and should also be known to a skilled worker or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the oxidative cleavage is performed using periodate oxidation. In a further embodiment, for example and without limitation, the periodate used is NaIO4. The process for conversion of the compound of formula 1 into the compound of formula 2 can also be performed as described in Synthesis, 1982, 28-29, incorporated herein by reference. The compound of formula 2 can undergo an elimination reaction in the presence of a base to remove the leaving group and form an alkene. The alkene obtained can then undergo a Wittig or a Horner-Wadsworth Emmons reaction, by reacting with a Ph3P═CHCO2Me (9), or analogs thereof, to form the compound of formula 3. The base used for the elimination reaction is not particularly limited and has been described herein above. The analog of the compound of formula 9 is not particularly limited. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the phosphonate reagent (EtO)2P(═O)—CH2CO2Me is used. In another embodiment, for example and without limitation, the methyl group in the ester functionality has been replaced by an alternate alkyl group, such as, for example and without limitation, ethyl, propyl or butyl. The compound of formula 3 can then undergo hydrogenation of the alkene, followed by reduction of the ester functional group to an alcohol, and then protecting the resulting alcohol to form the compound of formula 4. The conditions for the hydrogenation reaction are not particularly limited and should be known to a skilled worker or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the hydrogenation reaction is performed using a hydrogenation catalyst, such as for example and without limitation, palladium on carbon (Pd/C). Again in the hydrogenation reaction, and without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the presence of the 1,2-isopropylidene group can direct hydrogenation from the β-face, i.e. below the plane of the paper, which can lead to a stereoisomer having the desired stereochemistry, in high diastereomeric excess (d.e.). The reaction for reduction of an ester to an alcohol is not particularly limited and should be known to a skilled worker or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, reduction is performed using a hydride source. The hydride source used is not particularly limited and should be known to a skilled worker or can be determined. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the hydride source is lithium aluminum hydride (LAH), lithium triethylborohydride (LiEt3BH), diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBALH) or sodium borohydride (NaBH4). As noted above, using the process disclosed in the specification, compounds having high diastereomeric purity can be obtained. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the chiral purity of any one of the compounds of formula 2 to 7 is about 99.0%, 99.1%, 99.2%, 99.3% 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, 99.9% d.e. or any values in between. In one embodiment, for example and without limitation, the compound of formula 4a can be obtained from the compound of formula 1, according to the Scheme 1, shown below. In another embodiment, for example and without limitation, the compound of formula 7a can be obtained from the compound of formula 4a, according to Scheme 2, shown below.

EXAMPLES The following examples are illustrative and non-limiting, and represent specific embodiments of the present invention. The compound of formula 2a can be prepared as described in Synthesis 1982, 28-29, incorporated herein by reference. Example 1 Preparation of Compound of Formula 3a Compound 2a (1 wt. parts) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol (4.6 vol. parts) and water (1.8 vol. parts). NaHCO3 (0.6 wt. parts) was added and the mixture heated to reflux until reaction was complete by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). The mixture was cooled to ambient and methyl triphenylphosphoranylidene acetate (1.14 wt. parts) was added. After stifling for 0.5 hr, the reaction mixture was quenched with water and extracted 2 times with methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE). The combined organic extract was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under vacuum to give a residue. The residue was triturated with methyl t-butyl ether (3.6 vol. parts), filtered and rinsed with methyl t-butyl ether. The filtrate was concentrated to give compound 3a (1.2 wt. parts) as a mixture of cis/trans-isomers. Example 2 Preparation of Compound of Formula 4a A solution of compound 3a (1 wt. parts), dissolved in i-PrOH (20 vol. parts) was added to 10 wt/wt % palladium on carbon (Pd/C) (0.4 wt. parts) in a Parr hydrogenation flask. The reaction vessel was pressurized to 40 psi with hydrogen and maintained at this pressure, while being agitated for 20 hours. Following this, the reaction mixture was filtered through a plug of celite, which was then rinsed with methanol (MeOH) (25 vol. parts). The combined filtrate and MeOH rinse was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a viscous oil. This crude product was then dissolved in diethylether (Et2O) (40 vol. parts), set stirring, and cooled in an ice bath. LiAlH4 (2 eq., 0.34 wt. parts) was then added portion-wise. After complete addition, the ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over the course of 3 hours. The slurry was then quenched by the slow addition of water (0.34 vol. parts), aqueous 1N NaOH (0.34 vol. parts), and then more water (1.02 vol. parts), followed by a period of stifling (20 minutes). Na2SO4 was then added to remove excess water. After filtering off the solids, and concentrating the filtrate under reduces pressure, the resultant crude oil was dissolved in pyridine (18 vol. parts), set stifling, and cooled in an ice bath under a nitrogen (N2 (g)) atmosphere. To the mixture was added pivaloyl chloride (PivCl) (1.7 eq., 0.9 wt. parts), and the reaction was left to warm to ambient temperature over a period of 20 hours. Following this, the contents of the reaction flask were poured onto water (40 vol. parts) and stirred for 1 hour. This mixture was then extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 times 20 vol. parts). The combined extracts were washed with NaHCO3, followed by brine, and dried over Na2SO4. After filtering and concentration under reduced pressure, the crude oil was subjected to column chromatography (stationary phase: SiO2, eluent: 1:1 Heptanes:EtOAc) to yield compound 4a (0.4 eq.) as a colorless oil. Example 3 Preparation of Compound of Formula 6a Compound 4a (1 wt. parts) and 1-(acetyloxy)-1-(trimethylsilyl)-2-propene (3.0 eq., 1.8 wt. parts) were dissolved in anhydrous dichloroethane (DCE) (4 vol. parts) under nitrogen (N2 (g)). While cooling the reaction vessel in an ice water bath, BF3OEt2 (4.6 eq., 2.3 wt. parts) was added in a dropwise fashion. The reaction mixture was then left to warm to room temperature over 20 hours. Following this, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (120 vol. parts), washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was then dissolved in MeOH (4 vol. parts). A solution of K2CO3 (0.6 eq., 0.3 wt. parts) dissolved in water (4 vol. parts) was then added, and the resulting mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. After dilution with EtOAc (120 vol. parts) and washing with brine until the washings are neutral (pH 7 by pH paper), the organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was then treated with 0.3 wt. parts of ethylene glycol (1.5 eq.), and with 0.06 wt. parts of pyridinium para-toluene sulfonate (PPTS) (0.07 eq.), in toluene (10 vol. parts) at reflux for 1 hour. Following this, the crude residue obtained by concentrating the reaction mixture under reduced pressure, was directly applied to the top of a silica gel column, and eluted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). Fractions containing the product were collected and concentrated to dryness to yield compound 6a (0.24 eq.) as a yellow oil. Example 4 Preparation of Compound of Formula 6b Compound 4a (1 eq.) and 1-(acetyloxy)-1-(trimethylsilyl)-2-propene (3.0 eq.) were dissolved in anhydrous dichloroethane (DCE) (12 vol. parts) under nitrogen (N2 (g)). The internal temperature of this solution was maintained at 0° C. and BF3OEt2 (4.6 eq.) was added in a dropwise fashion. Stirring was continued at 0° C. for 6 h. Following this, the reaction was quenched by the slow addition of aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (40 vol. parts) at 0° C. and then warming to room temperature. Once the evolution of gas had ceased, the layers were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 times 40 vol. parts). The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the crude residue via column chromatography, (stationary phase: SiO2, eluent: 1:1 heptanes:EtOAc), afforded (0.5 wt. parts, 44% yield) of compound 6b as a light yellow oil. Example 5 Preparation of Compound of Formula 10a Compound 6b (1 eq.) was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (15 vol.). To this solution was then added Dess-Martin periodinane reagent (1.5 eq.). After stirring at ambient temperature for 20 hours, the reaction mixture was concentrated. The resulting residue was triturated with methyl i-butyl(ether (MTBE), the solids were removed by filtration, and the filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure. Further purification was achieved by passing the crude product through a silica plug and eluting with 1:1 heptane:EtOAc. This produced (0.87 wt. parts, 87% yield) of ketone 10a. Example 6 Preparation of Compound of Formula 7a In an appropriately sized reaction vessel, pyridine-sulfur trioxode complex (3.1 eq., 1.5 wt. parts) was dissolved in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (5.9 vol. parts) under nitrogen (N2). After stifling for 10 minutes, triethylamine (NEt3) (3.9 eq., 1.2 wt. parts) was added followed by a solution of 6a (1 wt. parts) dissolved in anhydrous DMSO (8.7 vol. parts) which was added dropwise over the course of 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was left to stir for 1 hour, and then diluted with dietylehter (Et2O) (440 vol. parts), washed with water, brine, and dried over Na2SO4. Filtration and concentration provided a yellow oil which was passed through a silica plug, eluting with 1:1 heptanes:EtOAc. The resulting colorless oil was then dissolved and set stirring in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (5.9 vol. parts) in an appropriately sized nitrogen (N2 (g)) purged flask. To this solution was added a 0.5M solution of Tebbe's reagent in toluene (0.85 eq., 5.0 vol. parts). The dark red reaction mixture was left to stir for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was diluted with diethylether (Et2O) (60 vol. parts), 10 drops of 0.1N NaOH were added, followed by Na2SO4 and the slurry was stirred for a further 20 minutes. Filtration through celite to remove the solids, followed by passage through a plug of silica eluting with 1:1 Heptanes:EtOAc and concentration under reduced pressure yielded an oil which was used directly for the next step. A solution of pyridinium para-toluene sulfonate (PPTS) (0.4 eq., 0.3 wt. parts) dissolved in acetone (26 vol. parts) and water (2.9 vol. parts) was added to the crude residue, and then heated to reflux for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (440 vol. parts), washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 followed by brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (stationary phase: SiO2, eluent: 1:1 heptanes:EtOAc) provided compound 7a (0.034 eq.) as a colorless oil. Example 7 Preparation of Compound of Formula 7a from 10a A solution of compound 10a (1 eq.), dissolved in anhydrous THF (8 vol. parts), was cooled to 0° C. To this mixture was slowly added Tebbe's reagent (1.3 eq., 0.5M in toluene) using a cannula. The resulting dark red solution was stirred at 0° C. for 45 minutes. Once complete disappearance of the staring material had been observed by TLC, the reaction was diluted with MTBE (20 vol. parts), quenched by slow addition of aqueous 0.1N NaOH (2.5 vol. parts) at 0° C., and then allowed to warm to room temperature within approximately 1 hour. The brown/orange suspension was filtered through a plug of silica, concentrated under reduced pressure, triturated with pentane, filtered through a disposable frit, and then concentrated again. MeOH (6.5 vol. parts) was added followed by saturated aqueous K2CO3 (6.5 vol. parts), and the resulting biphasic slurry was stirred rapidly for 20 minutes. TLC analysis indicated complete hydrolysis of the acetate-enolether at this point. In order to hydrolyze the vinyl-enolether (formed by reaction of the Tebbe reagent with the carbonyl group of the enol-acetate) the reaction flask was cooled in an ice bath while concentrated HCl (4 vol. parts) was slowly added. After complete hydrolysis of both the enol-acetate and the vinyl-enolether, the mixture of free aldehyde and methoxy-hemiacetal was concentrated to approximately half the initial volume on the rotary evaporator. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) (13 vol. parts) was added, and the mixture was again concentrated. This was repeated two more times. The resulting acidic aqueous solution was neutralized with aqueous NaHCO3, and extracted with EtOAc (3 times 8 vol. parts). The organic extracts were combined, rinsed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (stationary phase: SiO2, eluent: 7:3 heptane:EtOAc) afforded compound 7a (0.23 wt. parts, 25% yield) as a light yellow oil.
