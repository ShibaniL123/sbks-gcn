RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/252,989, filed on Oct. 19, 2009. The entire teaching of the above application is incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor compounds having antiviral activity against HCV and useful in the treatment of HCV infections. More particularly, the invention relates to bismacrocyclic compounds, compositions containing such compounds and methods for using the same, as well as processes for making such compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION HCV is the principal cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis and is an increasingly severe public health problem both in the developed and developing world. It is estimated that the virus infects over 200 million people worldwide, surpassing the number of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by nearly five fold. HCV infected patients, due to the high percentage of individuals inflicted with chronic infections, are at an elevated risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver, subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma and terminal liver disease. HCV is the most prevalent cause of hepatocellular cancer and cause of patients requiring liver transplantations in the western world. There are considerable barriers to the development of anti-HCV therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to, the persistence of the virus, the genetic diversity of the virus during replication in the host, the high incident rate of the virus developing drug-resistant mutants, and the lack of reproducible infectious culture systems and small-animal models for HCV replication and pathogenesis. In a majority of cases, given the mild course of the infection and the complex biology of the liver, careful consideration must be given to antiviral drugs, which are likely to have significant side effects. Only two approved therapies for HCV infection are currently available. The original treatment regimen generally involves a 3-12 month course of intravenous interferon-α (IFN-α), while a new approved second-generation treatment involves co-treatment with IFN-α and the general antiviral nucleoside mimics like ribavirin. Both of these treatments suffer from interferon related side effects as well as low efficacy against HCV infections. There exists a need for the development of effective antiviral agents for treatment of HCV infection due to the poor tolerability and disappointing efficacy of existing therapies. In a patient population where the majority of individuals are chronically infected and asymptomatic and the prognoses are unknown, an effective drug would desirably possess significantly fewer side effects than the currently available treatments. The hepatitis C non-structural protein-3 (NS3) is a proteolytic enzyme required for processing of the viral polyprotein and consequently viral replication. Despite the huge number of viral variants associated with HCV infection, the active site of the NS3 protease remains highly conserved thus making its inhibition an attractive mode of intervention. Recent success in the treatment of HIV with protease inhibitors supports the concept that the inhibition of NS3 is a key target in the battle against HCV. HCV is a flaviridae type RNA virus. The HCV genome is enveloped and contains a single strand RNA molecule composed of circa 9600 base pairs. It encodes a polypeptide comprised of approximately 3010 amino acids. The HCV polyprotein is processed by viral and host peptidase into 10 discreet peptides which serve a variety of functions. There are three structural proteins, C, E1 and E2. The P7 protein is of unknown function and is comprised of a highly variable sequence. There are six non-structural proteins. NS2 is a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase that functions in conjunction with a portion of the NS3 protein. NS3 incorporates two catalytic functions (separate from its association with NS2): a serine protease at the N-terminal end, which requires NS4A as a cofactor, and an ATP-ase-dependent helicase function at the carboxyl terminus. NS4A is a tightly associated but non-covalent cofactor of the serine protease. The NS3-NS4A protease is responsible for cleaving four sites on the viral polyprotein. The NS3-NS4A cleavage is autocatalytic, occurring in cis. The remaining three hydrolyses, NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A and NS5A-NS5B all occur in trans. NS3 is a serine protease which is structurally classified as a chymotrypsin-like protease. While the NS serine protease possesses proteolytic activity by itself, the HCV protease enzyme is not an efficient enzyme in terms of catalyzing polyprotein cleavage. It has been shown that a central hydrophobic region of the NS4A protein is required for this enhancement. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficacy at all of the sites. A general strategy for the development of antiviral agents is to inactivate virally encoded enzymes, including NS3, that are essential for the replication of the virus. Current efforts directed toward the discovery of NS3 protease inhibitors were reviewed by S. Tan, A. Pause, Y. Shi, N. Sonenberg, Hepatitis C Therapeutics: Current Status and Emerging Strategies, Nature Rev. Drug Discov., 1, 867-881 (2002).

Absent VII The present invention also features pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Compounds of the present invention can be administered as the sole active pharmaceutical agent, or used in combination with one or more agents to treat or prevent hepatitis C infections or the symptoms associated with HCV infection. Other agents to be administered in combination with a compound or combination of compounds of the invention include therapies for disease caused by HCV infection that suppresses HCV viral replication by direct or indirect mechanisms. These include agents such as host immune modulators (for example, interferon-alpha, pegylated interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, interferon-gamma, CpG oligonucleotides and the like), or antiviral compounds that inhibit host cellular functions such as inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (for example, ribavirin and the like). Also included are cytokines that modulate immune function. Also included are vaccines comprising HCV antigens or antigen adjuvant combinations directed against HCV. Also included are agents that interact with host cellular components to block viral protein synthesis by inhibiting the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) initiated translation step of HCV viral replication or to block viral particle maturation and release with agents targeted toward the viroporin family of membrane proteins such as, for example, HCV P7 and the like. Other agents to be administered in combination with a compound of the present invention include any agent or combination of agents that inhibit the replication of HCV by targeting proteins of the viral genome involved in the viral replication. These agents include but are not limited to other inhibitors of HCV RNA dependent RNA polymerase such as, for example, nucleoside type polymerase inhibitors described in WO 01/90121(A2), or U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,587B1 or WO 01/60315 or WO 01/32153 or non-nucleoside inhibitors such as, for example, benzimidazole polymerase inhibitors described in EP 1162196A1 or WO 02/04425 or inhibitors of HCV protease such as, for example, peptidomimetic type inhibitors such as BILN2061 and the like or inhibitors of HCV helicase.

It is understood that any alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl moiety described herein can also be an aliphatic group, an alicyclic group or a heterocyclic group. An “aliphatic group” is non-aromatic moiety that may contain any combination of carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, halogen atoms, oxygen, nitrogen or other atoms, and optionally contain one or more units of unsaturation, e.g., double and/or triple bonds. An aliphatic group may be straight chained, branched or cyclic and preferably contains between about 1 and about 24 carbon atoms, more typically between about 1 and about 12 carbon atoms. In addition to aliphatic hydrocarbon groups, aliphatic groups include, for example, polyalkoxyalkyls, such as polyalkylene glycols, polyamines, and polyimines, for example. Such aliphatic groups may be further substituted. It is understood that aliphatic groups may be used in place of the alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylene, alkenylene, and alkynylene groups described herein. The term “alicyclic,” as used herein, denotes a group derived from a monocyclic or polycyclic saturated carbocyclic ring compound. Examples include, but not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptyl, and bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl. Such alicyclic groups may be further substituted. The term “heterocycloalkyl” and “heterocyclic” can be used interchangeably and refer to a non-aromatic 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-membered ring or a bi- or tri-cyclic group fused system, where (i) each ring contains between one and three heteroatoms independently selected from oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, (ii) each 5-membered ring has 0 to 1 double bonds and each 6-membered ring has 0 to 2 double bonds, (iii) the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized, (iv) the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized, (v) any of the above rings may be fused to a benzene ring, and (vi) the remaining ring atoms are carbon atoms which may be optionally oxo-substituted. Representative heterocycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, [1,3]dioxolane, pyrrolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, oxazolidinyl, isoxazolidinyl, morpholinyl, thiazolidinyl, isothiazolidinyl, quinoxalinyl, pyridazinonyl, and tetrahydrofuryl. Such heterocyclic groups may be further substituted to give substituted heterocyclic. It will be apparent that in various embodiments of the invention, the substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl, and heterocycloalkyl are intended to be monovalent or divalent. Thus, alkylene, alkenylene, and alkynylene, cycloaklylene, cycloalkenylene, cycloalkynylene, arylalkylene, hetoerarylalkylene and heterocycloalkylene groups are to be included in the above definitions, and are applicable to provide the formulas herein with proper valency. The term “hydroxyl activating group”, as used herein, refers to a labile chemical moiety which is known in the art to activate a hydroxyl group so that it will depart during synthetic procedures such as in a substitution or elimination reactions. Examples of hydroxyl activating group include, but not limited to, mesylate, tosylate, triflate, p-nitrobenzoate, phosphonate and the like. The term “activated hydroxyl”, as used herein, refers to a hydroxyl group activated with a hydroxyl activating group, as defined above, including mesylate, tosylate, triflate, p-nitrobenzoate, phosphonate groups, for example. The term “protected hydroxyl,” as used herein, refers to a hydroxyl group protected with a hydroxyl protecting group, as defined above, including benzoyl, acetyl, trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, methoxymethyl groups. The terms “halo” and “halogen,” as used herein, refer to an atom selected from fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. The compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-, or as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optical isomers may be prepared from their respective optically active precursors by the procedures described above, or by resolving the racemic mixtures. The resolution can be carried out in the presence of a resolving agent, by chromatography or by repeated crystallization or by some combination of these techniques, which are known to those skilled in the art. Further details regarding resolutions can be found in Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions (John Wiley & Sons, 1981). When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. The configuration of any carbon-carbon double bond appearing herein is selected for convenience only and is not intended to designate a particular configuration unless the text so states; thus a carbon-carbon double bond depicted arbitrarily herein as trans may be cis, trans, or a mixture of the two in any proportion. The term “subject” as used herein refers to a mammal. A subject therefore refers to, for example, dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, guinea pigs, and the like. Preferably the subject is a human.

Examples of amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, t-butoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable ester” refers to esters of the compounds formed by the process of the present invention which hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms.

Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art, for example, as discussed in Bundgaard, (ed.), Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985); Widder, et al. (ed.), Methods in Enzymology, vol. 4, Academic Press (1985); Krogsgaard-Larsen, et al., (ed). “Design and Application of Prodrugs, Textbook of Drug Design and Development,” Chapter 5, 113-191 (1991); Bundgaard, et al., Journal of Drug Deliver Reviews, 8:1-38 (1992); Bundgaard, J. of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 77:285 et seq. (1988); Higuchi and Stella (eds.) Prodrugs as Novel Drug Delivery Systems, American Chemical Society (1975); and Bernard Testa & Joachim Mayer, “Hydrolysis In Drug And Prodrug Metabolism: Chemistry, Biochemistry And Enzymology,” John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. (2002). The term “acyl” includes residues derived from acids, including but not limited to carboxylic acids, carbamic acids, carbonic acids, sulfonic acids, and phosphorous acids. Examples include aliphatic carbonyls, aromatic carbonyls, aliphatic sulfonyls, aromatic sulfinyls, aliphatic sulfinyls, aromatic phosphates and aliphatic phosphates. Examples of aliphatic carbonyls include, but are not limited to, acetyl, propionyl, 2-fluoroacetyl, butyryl, 2-hydroxy acetyl, and the like. The term “aprotic solvent,” as used herein, refers to a solvent that is relatively inert to proton activity, i.e., not acting as a proton-donor. Examples include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons, such as hexane and toluene, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, for example, methylene chloride, ethylene chloride, chloroform, and the like, heterocyclic compounds, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran and N-methylpyrrolidinone, and ethers such as diethyl ether, bis-methoxymethyl ether. Such solvents are well known to those skilled in the art, and individual solvents or mixtures thereof may be preferred for specific compounds and reaction conditions, depending upon such factors as the solubility of reagents, reactivity of reagents and preferred temperature ranges, for example. Further discussions of aprotic solvents may be found in organic chemistry textbooks or in specialized monographs, for example: Organic Solvents Physical Properties and Methods of Purification, 4th ed., edited by John A. Riddick et al., Vol. II, in the Techniques of Chemistry Series, John Wiley & Sons, NY, 1986. The terms “protogenic organic solvent” or “protic solvent” as used herein, refer to a solvent that tends to provide protons, such as an alcohol, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, t-butanol, and the like. Such solvents are well known to those skilled in the art, and individual solvents or mixtures thereof may be preferred for specific compounds and reaction conditions, depending upon such factors as the solubility of reagents, reactivity of reagents and preferred temperature ranges, for example. Further discussions of protogenic solvents may be found in organic chemistry textbooks or in specialized monographs, for example: Organic Solvents Physical Properties and Methods of Purification, 4th ed., edited by John A. Riddick et al., Vol. II, in the Techniques of Chemistry Series, John Wiley & Sons, NY, 1986. Combinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term “stable”, as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and which maintains the integrity of the compound for a sufficient period of time to be useful for the purposes detailed herein (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic administration to a subject). The synthesized compounds can be separated from a reaction mixture and further purified by a method such as column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography, or recrystallization. Additionally, the various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. In addition, the solvents, temperatures, reaction durations, etc. delineated herein are for purposes of illustration only and variation of the reaction conditions can produce the desired bridged macrocyclic products of the present invention. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein include, for example, those described in R. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2d. Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1991); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995). The compounds of this invention may be modified by appending various functionalities via synthetic means delineated herein to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion. Pharmaceutical Compositions The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), buccally, or as an oral or nasal spray. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir, preferably by oral administration or administration by injection. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance the stability of the formulated compound or its delivery form. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or: a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons. Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. Antiviral Activity An inhibitory amount or dose of the compounds of the present invention may range from about 0.01 mg/Kg to about 500 mg/Kg, alternatively from about 1 to about 50 mg/Kg. Inhibitory amounts or doses will also vary depending on route of administration, as well as the possibility of co-usage with other agents. According to the methods of treatment of the present invention, viral infections are treated or prevented in a subject such as a human or lower mammal by administering to the subject an anti-hepatitis C virally effective amount or an inhibitory amount of a compound of the present invention, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. An additional method of the present invention is the treatment of biological samples with an inhibitory amount of a compound of composition of the present invention in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. The term “anti-hepatitis C virally effective amount” of a compound of the invention, as used herein, mean a sufficient amount of the compound so as to decrease the viral load in a biological sample or in a subject (e.g., resulting in at least 10%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 80%, and most preferably at least 90% or 95%, reduction in viral load). As well understood in the medical arts, an anti-hepatitis C virally effective amount of a compound of this invention will be at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. The term “inhibitory amount” of a compound of the present invention means a sufficient amount to decrease the hepatitis C viral load in a biological sample or a subject (e.g., resulting in at least 10%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 80%, and most preferably at least 90% or 95%, reduction in viral load). It is understood that when said inhibitory amount of a compound of the present invention is administered to a subject it will be at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment as determined by a physician. The term “biological sample(s),” as used herein, means a substance of biological origin intended for administration to a subject. Examples of biological samples include, but are not limited to, blood and components thereof such as plasma, platelets, subpopulations of blood cells and the like; organs such as kidney, liver, heart, lung, and the like; sperm and ova; bone marrow and components thereof; or stem cells. Thus, another embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating a biological sample by contacting said biological sample with an inhibitory amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Upon improvement of a subject's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. The subject may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific inhibitory dose for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. The total daily inhibitory dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a subject in single or in divided doses can be in amounts, for example, from 0.01 to 50 mg/kg body weight or more usually from 0.1 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses.

Synthetic Methods The present invention also includes synthetic methods and processes for making compounds of formula I. The compounds and processes of the present invention will be better understood in connection with the following synthetic schemes that illustrate the methods by which the compounds of the invention may be prepared, which are intended as an illustration only and not to limit the scope of the invention. Various changes and modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art and such changes and modifications including, without limitation, those relating to the chemical structures, substituents, derivatives, and/or methods of the invention may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. The general synthetic strategy is to construct one macrocyclic ring (either northwest or southeast macrocyclic ring) followed by another one. The synthesis of northwest macrocyclic ring can be achieved by intramolecular cross-coupling ring closure reaction, intramolecular alkylation, Mitsunobu ring closure reaction, intramolecular amide formation ring closure reaction or metathesis ring closure reaction. The southeast macrocyclic ring is usually constructed by ring closure metathesis reaction or intramolecular amide formation ring closure reaction. The synthesis of northwest macrocyclic ring 1-2 via intramolecular cross-coupling reaction is shown in Scheme 1. The precursor 1-1 (where X is a leaving group, such as a halogen, mesylate, tosylate or triflate and Ar1 and Ar2 are aryl or heteroaryl rings) closes the macrocyclic ring in the presence of transition metal such as palladium derivates, a ligand and a base. For a similar smaller ring (5 to 7 membered) closure reaction, see Karen E. Torraca, Shin-Itsu Kuwab, Stephen L. Buchwald, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 2000, 122, 12907-12908. The northwest macrocyclic ring 1-2 can also be prepared from intramolecular alkylation or Mituonobu reaction of the precursor 2-1, as shown in Scheme 2. Y is a leaving group, such as a halogen, mesylate, tosylate or triflate when the intramolecular alkylation conditions are used. Y is hydroxyl group for the intramolecular Mitunobu reaction. The intramolecular amide formation strategy is shown in Scheme 3. The precursor amino acid 3-1 is subjected to normal coupling reagents such as HATU/DIPEA, giving the desired macrocyclic ring 1-2. The construction of southeast macrocyclic ring via ring closure metathesis is illustrated in Scheme 4. The southeast macrocyclic ring precursor 4-1 is subjected to ring closure metathesis in the presence of a ruthenium-based catalyst to give the desired southeast macrocyclic ring core intermediate 4-2 (for further details on ring closing metathesis see recent reviews: Grubbs et al., Acc. Chem. Res., 1995, 28, 446; Shrock et al., Tetrahedron 1999, 55, 8141; Furstner, A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000, 39, 3012; Trnka et al., Acc. Chem. Res. 2001, 34, 18; and Hoveyda et al., Chem. Eur. J. 2001, 7, 945). The second ring closure to assembly the bismacrocyclic core structure is illustrated in Scheme 5. The bismacrocyclic precursor 5-1, which is prepared according to Scheme 1-3, is subjected to ring closure metathesis in the presence of a ruthenium-based catalyst to give the desired bismacrocyclic ring core 5-2. Alternatively, the bismacrocyclic precursor 5-3, which is prepared as shown in Scheme 4, undergoes ring closure reaction as described in Scheme 1 or 2, to give the core 5-2. The synthesis of bismacrocyclic core structure 5-2 is exemplified in Scheme 6 and 7. The synthesis of compound 1-6 (southeast macrocyclic ring) is outlined in Scheme 6. Deprotection of commercially available Boc-hydroxyproline 6-1 with HCl in dioxane followed by coupling with acid 6-2 using HATU, afforded intermediate 6-3. Other amino acid derivatives containing a terminal alkene may be used in place of 6-2 in order to generate varied macrocyclic structures (for further details see WO/0059929). Hydrolysis of 6-3 with LiOH followed by subsequent peptide coupling with cyclopropyl-containing amine 6-4 yielded tri-peptide 6-5. Finally, ring-closing metathesis with a ruthenium-based catalyst gave the desired intermediate 1-6. The bismacrocyclic ring core 7-6 (an example of general structure 5-2) was then prepared according to Scheme 7. The intermediate 6-6 was coupled with quionxaline derivative 7-1 under Mitsunobu conditions (such as using DIAD/Ph3P) giving compound 7-2. Attachment at the carbonyl oxygen was observed to form the desired compound. For further details on the Mitsunobu reaction, see O. Mitsunobu, Synthesis, 1981, 1-28; D. L. Hughes, Org. React., 29, 1-162 (1983); D. L. Hughes, Organic Preparations and Procedures Int., 28, 127-164 (1996); and J. A. Dodge, S. A. Jones, Recent Res. Dev. Org. Chem., 1, 273-283 (1997). Compound 7-2 was subjected to acidic deprotection (such as 4N HCl) to remove Boc group, followed by the reaction with phosgene in the presence of pyridine as base to form the intermediate isocyanate 7-3. The coupling reaction of compound 7-3 with diol 7-4 in the presence of DBU resulted in the bismacrocyclic ring precursor 7-5. Finally, compound 7-5 underwent intramolecular cross-coupling reaction catalyzed by transition metal such as a palladium-based catalyst (such as palladium acetate or Pd2(dba)3, in the presence of a ligand (such as [1,1′-binaphthalen]-2-ylbis(1,1-dimethylethyl)phosphine, or bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)[2′,4′,6′-tris(1-methylethyl)[1,1′-biphenyl]-2-yl]phosphine) to give the bismacrocyclic compound 7-6. The syntheses of bismacrocyclic compounds as HCV protease inhibitors are exemplified in Scheme 8. Hydrolysis of bismacrocyclic core compound 7-6 gave the corresponding carboxylic acid 8-1 (example 1), which reacted with cyclopropylsulfonamide in the presence of CDI/DBU or other coupling reagents to afford compound 8-2 (example 2). Hydrogenation of compound 8-2 in the presence of a catalyst (such as Pd—C 10%) gave compound 8-3 (example 3). Alternatively, compound 8-3 can be prepared from compound 8-4 (the saturated analog of intermediate 6-6) using the same chemistry as described in Scheme 7 and 8.

The compounds of the present invention exhibit potent inhibitory properties against the HCV NS3 protease. The following examples describe assays in which the compounds of the present invention can be tested for anti-HCV effects. Example 456 NS3/NS4a Protease Enzyme Assay The ability of the compounds to inhibit the HCV NS3 protease is determined using the assay described in published US patent application 2010/0003214, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Example 457 Cell-Based Replicon Assay The anti-HCV activity of the compounds is determined using the cell-based replicon assay and the HCV replication assay described in US Publication No: 2010/0003214, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. HCV Replicon Assay—Luciferase Since clinical drug resistance often develops in viral infections following single agent therapies, there is a need to assess the additive, antagonistic, or synergistic properties of combination therapies. We use the HCV replicon system to assess the potential use of the compound of the present invention or in combination therapies with Interferon alpha, cyclosporine analogs and inhibitors targeting other HCV proteins. The acute effects of a single or combinations of drugs are studied in the “Huh-luc/neo-ET” replicon with each chemical agent titrated in an X or Y direction in a 6 point two-fold dilution curve centered around the EC50 of each drug. Briefly, replicon cells are seeded at 7,000 cells per well in 90 ul DMEM (without phenol red, Invitrogen Cat.#31053-036) per well with 10% FCS, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% of Glutamax and 1% of 100× penicillin/streptomycin and incubated overnight at 37° C., 5% CO2, 100% relative humidity. 16-20 h after seeding cells, test compounds previously solubilized and titrated in dimethyl sulfoxide (“DMSO”) from each X plate and Y plate are diluted 1:100 in DMEM (without phenol red, Invitrogen Cat.#31053-036) with 10% FCS, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% of Glutamax and 1% of 100× penicillin/streptomycin and added directly to the 96-well plate containing cells and growth medium at a 1:10 dilution for a final dilution of compound and DMSO of 1:1000 (0.2% DMSO final concentration). Drug treated cells are incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2, 100% relative humidity for 72 hours before performing a luciferase assay using 100 ul per well BriteLite Plus (Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data analysis utilizes the method published by Prichard and Shipman (Antiviral Research, 1990. 14:181-205). Using this method, the combination data are analyzed for antagonistic, additive, or synergistic combination effects across the entire combination surface created by the diluted compounds in combination. The compounds of the present invention can be effective against the HCV 1b genotype. It should also be understood that the compounds of the present invention can inhibit multiple genotypes of HCV. In one embodiment compound of the present invention are active against the 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, and 5a genotypes. Table 2 shows the EC50 values of representative compounds of the present invention against the HCV 1b genotype from the above described qRT-PCR or luciferase assay.
