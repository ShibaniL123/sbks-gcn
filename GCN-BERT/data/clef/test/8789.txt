Step 4: 2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b][1,2]thiazine-1,1-dioxide p- toluenesulfonate
To a solution of 6-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b] [1,2]thiazine-1,1-dioxide (46 mg , 0.15 mmol) in 1.5 mL ethyl acetate was added p-toluenesulfonic acid (47 mg, 0.30 mmol), and stirred at room temperature overnight. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, washed with ethyl acetate, and dried to give the product 2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydropyrrolo[3',4':3,4]pyrazolo[1,5-b][1,2]thiazine-1,1-dioxide p-toluenesulfonate (48 mg). Yield: 83%.
