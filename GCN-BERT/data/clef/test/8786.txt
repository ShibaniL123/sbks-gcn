Example 9. 4-Amino-5-cyano-6-((1-(8-chloro-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrimidine
Step 1. Preparation of 3-Chloroisatoic anhydride
2-Amino-3-chlorobenzoic acid (34.2g, 0.2mol) and 175ml of acetonitrile were added to a 500ml three-necked flask, heated to 55Â°C, and then triphosgene in dichloromethane (triphosgene (29.6g, 0.1mol) dissolved in 150ml of dichloromethane) was added dropwise, and pyridine (50ml, 0.6mol) was added dropwise at the same time, the dropping was completed in about 30min, and the reaction was carried out for 5h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction solution was subjected to suction filtration when it was still hot, and the filter cake was washed with 100ml ethyl acetate. The solvent was removed from the filtrate to give a black oil. Ice-water mixture was added to the black oil and a large amount of solid was precipitated. The solid was subjected to suction filtration, drying, recrystallization by ethyl acetate-petroleum ether system, and then subjected to suction filtration and drying to give 30.8g of grey solid with a yield of 78.2%.
