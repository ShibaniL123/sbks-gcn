Latin name of genus and species of plant claimed: Impatiens×hybrida. Variety denomination: ‘Balbouite’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Impatiens plant botanically known as Impatiens×hybrida and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name ‘Balbouite’. The new cultivar originated in a controlled breeding program in Cartago, Costa Rica during December 2010. The objective of the breeding program was the development of Impatiens cultivars that perform well under both sun and shade conditions and have a moderately vigorous, compact, mounded-spreading growth habit. The new Impatiens×hybrida cultivar is the result of cross-pollination. The female (seed) parent of the new cultivar is the proprietary Impatiens flaccida breeding selection coded N795, not patented, characterized by its white-colored flowers, medium green-colored foliage, and vigorous, spreading growth habit. The male (pollen) parent of the new cultivar is the proprietary Impatiens hawkeri breeding selection coded N786, not patented, characterized by its white-colored flowers, medium green-colored foliage, and moderately vigorous, mounded growth habit. The new cultivar was discovered and selected as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the above stated cross-pollination during April 2011 in a controlled environment in Cartago, Costa Rica. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar by terminal stem cuttings since April 2011 in Cartago, Costa Rica, Arroyo Grande, Calif., and West Chicago, Ill. has demonstrated that the new cultivar reproduces true to type with all of the characteristics, as herein described, firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of such asexual propagation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following characteristics of the new cultivar have been repeatedly observed and can be used to distinguish ‘Balbouite’ as a new and distinct cultivar of Impatiens plant: 1. White-colored flowers;2. Medium green-colored foliage; and3. Moderately vigorous, compact, mounded-spreading growth habit. Plants of the new cultivar differ from plants of the female parent primarily in having a larger leaf size, larger flower size and a more mounded growth habit. Plants of the new cultivar differ from plants of the male parent primarily in having a smaller leaf size, smaller flower size and a more spreading growth habit. Of the many commercially available Impatiens cultivars, the most similar in comparison to the new cultivar is SUNPATIENS Compact White Improved ‘SAKIMP014’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 19,605. However, in side by side comparisons, plants of the new cultivar differ from plants of ‘SAKIMP014’ in at least the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new cultivar have more main branches than plants of ‘SAKIMP014’;2. Plants of the new cultivar have leaves that are smaller in length than and lighter colored than plants of ‘SAKIMP014’; and3. Plants of the new cultivar have a flower color slightly different from plants of ‘SAKIMP014’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photographs show, as nearly true as it is reasonably possible to make the same in color illustrations of this type, typical flower and foliage characteristics of the new cultivar. Colors in the photographs differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed description, which accurately describes the colors of ‘Balbouite’. The plants were grown in 4.5-inch pots for 10 weeks in a greenhouse in West Chicago, Ill. FIG. 1 illustrates a side view of the overall growth and flowering habit of ‘Balbouite’. FIG. 2 illustrates a close-up view of an individual flower of ‘Balbouite’. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The new cultivar has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions to date. Accordingly, it is possible that the phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in the environment, such as temperature, light intensity, and day length, without, however, any variance in genotype. The chart used in the identification of colors described herein is The R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society, London, England, 2007 edition, except where general color terms of ordinary significance are used. The color values were determined in February 2014 under natural light conditions in West Chicago, Ill. The following descriptions and measurements describe plants produced from cuttings from stock plants and grown in a glass-covered greenhouse under conditions comparable to those used in commercial practice. The plants were grown in West Chicago, Ill. in 4.5-inch pots for 10 weeks utilizing a soilless growth medium. Greenhouse temperatures were maintained at approximately 66° F. to 70° F. (19° C. to 21° C.) during the day and approximately 58° F. to 62° F. (14° C. to 17° C.) during the night. Greenhouse light levels of 2,500 footcandles to 6,000 footcandles were maintained during the day. Measurements and numerical values represent averages of typical plants.
