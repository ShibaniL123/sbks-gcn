"COMPOSITION COMPRISING BEE PRODUCTS" DESCRIPTION The present application relates to a composition consisting of honey, beeswax and cocoa butter, characterized by a melting temperature of 36 ± 3 °C, pharmaceutical, veterinary or cosmetic formulations comprising or coated by said composition, and processes for the preparation of said composition and said formulations, STATE OF THE PRIOR ART The importance of bee products, both from a therapeutic and cosmetic standpoint, is known from ancient times. Bee products are known for their important therapeutic use in the field of protectio from irritations, inflammations and in the reduction of infection risk, in the dermatologicai field and in ophthalmology, and exert a protective ro!e on skin and mucous membranes. Honey, for instance, is known for its cicatrizing, antimicrobial, protective, antioxidant properties. Interest about honey is also linked to the fact that many of its protective therapeutic effects are due to mechanics! mechanisms of action and are therefore particularly safe. Honey is made up almost exclusively (95-99% of dry matter) of sugars, and simple sugars, glucose, fructose, constitute 85-95% thereof. Moreover, it contains traces of proteins, albumin, globulin, amino acids and mineral salts, traces of organic and inorganic salts and other components depending on the plant from which it derives; in addition, it is rich in phenolic compounds and other antioxidants, and of polyphenols. It is widely reported in the literature that honey has probsotic, antibacterial, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, Beeswax constitutes honeycomb cells and is mainly comprised of even- and odd-chain saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, monoesters of palmitic, oleic and hydroxypalmitic acids. There are chemical analyses apt to distinguish virgin beeswax from wax adulterated by paraffin. For some components of beeswax, protective and antiinflammatory effects at the level of gastric mucous membrane have been found, with effects on both irsdomethacin- and ethanoi-induced ulcers. Such results hint at a protective chemico-physical action mechanism due to the lipophilic character of wax, that might well be added to the aforedescribed benefits of honey. The use of beeswax and honey together is known, for topical applications. For instance, they are used in Middle East Countries together with olive oil for the treatment of skin lesions, even serious ones. However, in this type of preparations beeswax and honey are dispersed in olive oil and their preparation is extemporaneous, as the composition obtained is not easy to preserve. Moreover, the use of these formulations requires patients immobility for more or less lengthy times to enable the product to remain on the site of interest. In order to make bee products application/administration more practical, to reduce transport, storage, preservation problems and increase the compliance thereof, it would be extremely advantageous to combine the properties of wax and honey into a solid product. The necessary features of the product have to be such as to enable mixing of the two components, the hydrophilic one (honey) and the lipophilic one (beeswax), and to enable mixture melting at about 37°C. Moreover, also a good spreadability, along with a high safsty in case of oral administration, have to be guaranteed . The mixing of hydrophilic and lipophilic components usually occurs by use of surfactants and/or emuisifiers '{e.g., polyethylene glycols derivatives) in order to enable dispersion of lipophilic substances in the lipid mass. In particular, Chinese Patent Application CN 02764224 describes a mixture containing 16 to 20 parts of jojoba fat, 8 to 10 parts of cocoa butter, 10 to 14 parts of sunflower seed oil, 6 to 8 parts of beeswax, 1 to 3 parts of hyaluronic acid, 2 to 4 parts of coenzyme Q10 and 1 to 2 parts of honey. The composition described in the document is a balm, therefore a semisolid formulation, and is a mainly lipophilic formulation, in which the amount of hydrophilic product is minimal. As mentioned hereto, emulsifying agents such as acetylated lano!ine and others are normally used in the literature in order to incorporate honey into a lipophilic substrate. To be able to set up a solid formulation useful for topical or internal use in or on mammals, humans included, the formulation must have a melting temperature close to body temperature, and therefore a melting temperature close to 37°C and, to be able to be used for internal use, including an oral intake, it must have a high safety making it suitable to this type of administration. Therefore, it is of interest to develop solid compositions containing bee products such as wax and honey, free of surfactants and/or emuisifiers, with a melting temperature close to 37*0, in order to facilitate a topical and/or internal administration of the bee products. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION For carrying out the present invention, the authors tried to find a way to be able to incorporate, in an amount of up to 30 parts by weight on 100, a hydrophiiic product such as honey into a lipophilic matrix of natural substances comprising also beeswax. Since a product that could be safely administered, even orally, was desired, the authors of the present invention tried to find a substance, to be added to honey and beeswax, that were natural and safe from an oral and toxicoiogical standpoint. Cocoa butter has a known oral safety, both under the pharmaceutical toxicoiogical profile and the alimentary profile. It is substantially free of substances having a biological activity and its lipid content does not compromise blood triglyceride profile. Moreover, it has a good substance release profile and is widely used on mucous membranes. However, cocoa butter, above all when used in large amounts in mixtures, exhibits a phenomenon well-known to the technician in the field, which is represented by polymorphism. It has long been known that various cocoa butter polymorphs do exist; the native form of pure cocoa butter is represented by polymorph beta, having a melting temperature of between 34*0 and 38 °C. It is known in the literature (e.g., Enrico Ragazzi "Lezioni di tecnica farmaceutica" Ed. Libreria Cortina 1978), that the thermal treatment of cocoa butter in the course of the preparation of molten masses (e.g., of suppositories) is an extremel critical step, and that the temperature at which this fat is treated must not be higher than 38 0C as, when cocoa butter is treated at temperatures higher than 38°C, at cooling the polymorphism phenomenon occurs, i.e. the coexistence of cocoa butter in various crystalline forms, each one having a different melting point.. Forms a and y, in particular, have a melting temperature respectively at 22 and 18 °C, and an overheating of cocoa butter leads to the presence of crystals in the above-mentioned forms, remarkably lowering the melting point of cocoa butter, therefore making it unsuitable to be present in high percentages in formulations thai must have a final melting temperature close to 37°C , However, the Inventors surprisingly discovered that cocoa butter, when co- melt with suitable proportions of beeswax and honey at temperatures between 65 and 90 °C, does not exhibit, in the cooling and solidification stage, the formation of polymorphs a and y. This data is evident from Figure 1 , in which it is clearly seen that the melting profile of pure cocoa butter and that of a composition consisting of from >0≤ 30 parts by weight of honey from >0 17 parts by weight of beeswax from≥ 65 parts by weight of cocoa butter for a total of 100 parts by weight are substantially overlapping and that no melting peaks are present at the temperatures of polymorphs a and y. 5 The result, entirely unexpected, therefore enables to incorporate a high amount of hydrophilic substances, such as honey, into a lipophilic matrix consisting of at least 65 parts by weight of cocoa butter, and from >0≤ 17 parts by weight of beeswax, obtaining a product that has a melting temperature of 36 ± 3 °C. To the ends of the present invention, by >0 it is meant different from 0, preferably at !0 least≥0. . The value >0 as indicated in the patent may therefore be replaced anywhere by the value≥0.1. This result may be obtained without particular preparatory contrivances, by heating cocoa butter and beeswax concomitantly (co-melting) at the melting temperatures of beeswax, which are at about 7Q-8Q°C. i 5 The composition described herein is therefore useful for the treatment and the protection of skin and mucous membranes, given the known properties of honey and beeswax; moreover, thanks to the presence of honey, hydrophilic, it can also be used as a base or a coating for pharmaceutical, veterinary or cosmetic formulations, as it enables homogeneous incorporation of hydrophilic material. 20 In fact, by respecting the dosages described herein, compositions or formulations having the following characteristics are obtained -melting at a temperature close to body temperature of most mammals (36 ± 3 °C) -capable of releasing therapeutic substances on the mucous membranes thanks to the presence of honey 25 -without any evident mass disbomogeneity, therefore making pointless the aid of substances such as emulsifiers and/or surfactants. Hence, object of the invention are: -a composition consisting of 30 from >0≤ 30 parts by weight of honey from >0≤ 17 parts by weight of beeswax from≥65 parts by weight of cocoa butter for a total of 100 parts by weight. -a base or a coating for a pharmaceutical, veterinary, alimentary or cosmetic 35 formulation consisting of the above-described composition; -a pharmaceutical, veterinary, alimentary or cosmetic formulation comprising the composition as presented in the present description and one or more active ingredients and/or adjuvants and/or excipients; -a process for the preparation of the composition as presented in the present description, comprising the following steps a. subjecting to co-me!ting, at a temperature comprised between 55°C and 90°C, from >0≤3Q parts of honey; from: >0 <17 parts of beeswax; from≥ 65 parts of cocoa butter on a totai of 100 parts by weight b. cooling after pouring into suitable moulds or containers; and -a process for the preparation of the pharmaceutical, veterinary or cosmetic formulation as presented in the present description comprising the following steps; a. subjecting to co-melting, at a temperature comprised between 55°C and 90°C, from >0≤30 parts of honey; from >0≤17 parts of beeswax; from≥ 65 parts of cocoa butter on a total of 100 parts by weight; b. adding to the mixture prepared in a. one or more active ingredients and/or adjuvants and/or excipients so that said mixture prepared in a. represents at least 70%, at least 80% at least 90% or at least 95% by v/eight of the mixture obtained in step b. c. cooling after pouring into suitable moulds or containers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION: OF THE FIGURES Figure 1. Top to bottom, there are respectively reported the thermograms of: beeswax, showing a melting peak at about 70°C, denoted by "BEESWAX" composition according to the invention, showing a melting peak at 37 °C, denoted by "COMPOSITION A" pure cocoa butter, showing a melting peak at 34-37 °C, denoted by "COCOA BUTTER" There are reported; on the X-axis the time, on the Y-axis the energy administered to the sample, expressed as mW/mg. The figure clearly shows that the composition of the invention, prepared by simple standard techniques such as those described in the detailed section, at temperatures well above 38°C, has a melting peak at about 37*C; no melting peak is present for any of cocoa butter polymorphs a and y, and beeswax melting peak at 7Q°C is also lost, beeswax clearly being completely incorporated into the composition of the invention. !n the figure, it may be observed that the melting peaks of cocoa butter - pure and when formulated in Composition A - are coincident, confirming the maintaining of cocoa butter polymorph form beta. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present description relates to a composition consisting of from >G≤ 30 parts by weight of honey from >0≤ 17 parts by weight of beeswax from≥ 65 parts by weight of cocoa butter for a total of 100 parts by weight. Provided that these proportions are respected, ail combinations of possible relative amounts of the three components are possible, and each individual combination is part of the present description, Therefore, object of the present description is any combination between >0, >0, 1 , >0.2, >0.3, >0.4, >0.5, >0.6, >0.7, >0.8, >0.9, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 , 12, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 parts by weight of honey and any intermediate number among the above-specified ones, >0, >0.1 , >0.2, >0.3, >0,4, >0.5, >0.6, >0.7, >0.8, >G,9, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 , 12, 13, 14, 15. 16, 17 parts by weight of beeswax and any intermediate number among the above-specified ones, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 , 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 , 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91 , 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 and <100 parts by weight of cocoa butter and any intermediate number among the above-specified ones when the sum among these three elements is 100, wherein the sum of beeswax and honey does not exceed 35 parts by weight on 100. Any of these combinations is to be considered as described in the present description, since sufficient data are provided to easiiy and quickiy calculate the possible combinations, in one embodiment of the invention, the parts by weight of hone are >0.1 , or are 0.5, or are >1 , or are≥5; or are≥10; or are≥15; or are >20; or are≥25 and greater than or equal to any intermediate number among those indicated, or even 26, 27, 28, >29, and≤30. As already mentioned, the composition of the present invention enables a high incorporation of honey into a mainly lipophilic base resulting in a mass free of dishomogeneities, therefore making pointless the aid of substances such as emuisifiers and/or surfactants. The composition according to the invention therefore does not comprise surfactants, nor emuisifiers. According to further embodiments of the invention, the parts by weight of beeswax are≥0.1 , or are≥0,5, or are≥1 , or are≥5; or are >10: or are≥15 or greater than or equal to any intermediate number among those indicated, or even≥16 and <17, Part of the invention are embodiments wherein the parts by weight of honey are ≥0.1 , or are >Q.5, or are≥1 , or are≥5; or are 10; or are≥15; or are >20; or are≥25 and the parts by weight of beeswax are≥0.1 , or are≥0,5, or are≥1 , or are >5; or are >10; or are≥15 provided that, as evident from the above definition, the sum of beeswax and honey never exceeds 35 parts by weight on 100. According to a further embodiment, the parts by weight of cocoa butter are≥70; or are≥75; or are≥80; or are≥85, until reaching values anyhow <1 QQ. In particular, the composition according to the invention comprises embodiments wherein the parts by weight of honey are≥0.1 , or are >0.5, or are≥1 , or are >5; or are 10; or are≥15; or are≥2.0; or are≥25 and the parts by weight of beeswax are ≥0.1 , or are ≥0.5, or are >1 , or are >5; or are≥10; or are≥15 provided that, as evident from the above definition, the sum of beeswax and honey never exceeds 35 parts by weight on 100, and 70; or≥75; or >80; or 85 parts by weight of cocoa butter. In the present invention unadulterated natural beeswax, and pure, unadulterated bee honey and cocoa butter are used. The compositions in the above-described embodiments have a melting temperature of 36 ± 3 aC. Said temperature is particularly advantageous, as it enables compositions to be in a solid or semisolid state at temperatures close to the body temperatures of most mammals. In a particular embodiment, the composition is characterized by having a melting temperature of 36 ± 2°C, in particular a melting temperature of about 38, about 37, about 38 °C. For human use, embodiments with a melting temperature of about 37°C are preferred. According to the present description, there are described herein embodiments of the composition as above-indicated and as claimed, characterized in that they are substantially free of cocoa butter polymorphs a and/or γ. The term "substantially free" means that peaks related to these polymorphs are not detectable in thermograms of the composition of the invention, or that anyhow such polymorphs are not detectable in the composition of the invention. The term "substantially free" is used since conventional measurement means might not detect traces of polymorphs, in other terms, the above-mentioned polymorphs are not detectable by DSC (Differential Scanning Ga!orimefry). The absence or the substantial absence of these polymorphs enables the maintaining of the melting temperature of the composition at 36 ± 3 °C, a temperature that would not be possible in compositions comprising at !east 65 parts on 100 by weight of cocoa butter should cocoa butter be present as polymorphs a and/or γ. Given the constituent elements thereof and their meiting temperature, the compositions of the invention are suitable for a topical or infernal pharmaceutical or veterinary use for treatments of protection of the skin or of the mucous membranes thanks to the barrier effect and to the mucoadhesive abiiities of the composition, provided by the bee products contained therein. By "barrier effect" (BE) it is meant the ability of a compound or of a substance to create a protective film on a cei! surface, such as, e.g., the mucous membrane or the skin. The composition of the invention can, by virtue of the barrier and mucoadhesive effect given thereto by the bee products contained therein, facilitate the repair of damaged mucosal or skin tissue with entailed restoration of healthy and elastic skin or mucous membrane, or even simply carry out a protective effect on skin and mucous membranes from externa! agents, or drugs, etc. Moreover, as indicated above, the bee products contained in the composition also have antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects known from the literature, which are weii-matc ed to the barrier effect and the mucoadhesive properties. Therefore, object of the invention is the composition of the invention as described and claimed herein for use in the protective, lenitive or curative treatment of the skin or mucous membranes. By "lenitive or curative treatment" it is meant, for instance, the treatment of superficial lesions, insect bites, allergic states, sores, rashes, infections, inflammations, burns, abrasions. The skin lesions according to the present invention can be lesions that may involve also tissue underlying the skin and in which no open wounds are present, or can be lesions with open wounds or even burns or other types of iesions. By "skin Iesions not implying the presence of open wounds", according to the present description, are meant those Iesions in which the superficial layer of the skin, and the underlying layers, though not being wounded, are particularly fragile, irritated and damaged. Non-limiting examples of this type of iesions are represented by first-degree burns, first-degree decubitus lesions, pressure Iesions, newly cicatrized rashes, wounds or burns, irritations, erythemas, insect bites. Given the presence of antibacterial and antiinflammatory components in the bee products contained in the composition of the invention, the composition could also be directly used for the treatment of skin lesions or burns or inflammations or infections by topical or oral, rectal, vaginai administration. The compositions of the invention could then be used for the treatment or the prevention of skin lesions not implying the presence of open wounds, or in the prevention or slowing down of worsenings of the same, or in the treatment of skin lesions with open wounds. When the compositions of the invention are used for the protection of the skin, the application thereof will be topical. The composition could be prepared, for instance, in the form of stick. According to another embodiment, the compositions of the invention could be used, thanks to their mucoadhesive and barrier effect, for the protection of mucous membranes. in these cases the administration may be topical:, for all those mucous membranes on which a topical administration is possible, or may be internal (e.g., buccal, rectal, vaginal, nasal mucous membrane) or oral in the cases in which they be, e.g. intestinal or gastric mucous membranes. in this case as weii said protection could be a preventive protection, e.g. in all those cases envisaging the administration of drugs which have the side effect of attacking the mucous membranes, or in those patients exhibiting conditions of recurring irritation of the same. In other cases, the protection could instead be a protection for curative purposes or in order to avoid the worsening of irritated or partially compromised mucous membranes. The compositions for the protection of mucous membranes could therefore be made in the form of soft capsule, hard or soft gelatine, tablet, coated tablet, suppository, vaginai ovule. In the form of suppository there can, e.g., be used compositions according to the invention consisting of 5 io 17 parts by weight of beeswax, 5 to 25 parts by weight of honey, and 65 to 90 parts by weight of cocoa butter, for a total of 100 parts. Hereinafter there are provided non-limiting examples of compositions of the invention apt to be made in the form of suppository: EXAMPLES OF COMPOSITIONS IN THE FORM OF SUPPOSITOR!ES/VAGINAL OVULES Substance i parts As mentioned above, the composition of the invention could be made also for an ora! administration, e.g. in the form of hard or soft geiatine capsule, or of tablet. The technician in the field will know how to select the best proportions among the components of the composition as described herein to make the above- described forms for oral administration. By way of a non-limiting example, suitable for oral administration are embodiments wherein the composition consists of 2 to 17 parts by weight of beeswax, 5 to 30 parts by weight of honey, and 65 to 90 parts by weight of cocoa butter for a total of 100 parts by weight of composition. Hereinafter, there are provided non-limiting examples of compositions of the invention apt to be made for orai administration: As to the use of the composition in the protection of the skin, the invention can be made for topical administration in the form of iip sticks (balms) or cutaneous sticks . The technician in the field will know how to choose the best proportions among the components of the composition as described herein to make the above- described forms for topical administration. By way of a non-!imiting example, suitable for topical administration are embodiments wherein the composition consists of 4 to 17 parts by weight of beeswax, 10 to 25 parts by weight of honey, and 65 to 85 parts by weight of cocoa butter for a total of 100 parts by weight of composition. Hereinafter, there are provided non-limiting examples of compositions of the invention apt to be made for topical administration: The composition according to the present description could be made in the form of pharmaceutical composition or of medical device according to any one of the classes described in Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices (comprising also substances and not only "devices" in the mechanical sense of the term), or in any suitable form according to the regulatory provisions of the Country in which said composition will be produced. The compositions of the invention are therefore useful for their barrier effect properties and mucoadhesion properties in all those cases in which the protection of skin or mucous membranes is needed or desirable, those may be cases in which a drug that attacks mucous membranes or skin has to be administered, therefore in order to prevent or limit the damaging action of the drug or active ingredient, or in those cases in which the protection of a partially compromised skin or mucous membrane is preferable or desirable so as to enable a better and quicker healing thereof, defending it from further aggressions, or in those cases in which an individual has a chronic disorder in which skin or mucous membranes sustain irritations or alterations, therefore a barrier effect can prevent or limit damages on the skin or the mucous membrane. The invention also relates to a method for the treatment or for the prevention of the onset or the worsening of skin lesions not implying the presence of open wounds (e.g., by stick) or for the treatment of open wounds (e.g., by solidifying the composition on a device such as a gauze, a plaster or the tike so as to make a medicated device) wherein such method comprises one or more applications of the composition of the invention once or more per day on the concerned part. The application of the composition, for instance, could be repeated whenever needed, or once, twice, thrice, four or more times per day in general. Object of the present invention i$ also a method for the protective (preventive or curative) treatment of the skin or mucous membranes, providing the administration of the composition of the present invention to a patient in need thereof. Such administration could also be concomitantly with the administration of other drugs. A non-iimiting example of the method of treatment and/or of prevention of the skin or mucous membranes couid comprise the administration of a daily dosage, subdivided into a single dose or plural doses, of the composition according to the present description, for a period of time of between one and six weeks, e.g. of between three and six weeks or even for a period of time higher than six weeks, in accordance with the judgment of the treating doctor. Such administration could precede the administration of the drug even for a prolonged period, so as to the health state of the skin or of the mucous membrane to be treated. The treating doctor will know how to establish both the most appropriate dosage and the administration times, also on the basis of the patient's health state, weight, sex and age. As indicated above, the composition can then be used for interna! use, i.e. for oral, vaginal or recta! use, or topically, and therefore can be made in the form of suppository, vagina! ovule, film, cutaneous stick, lip bairn (stick), film (deposited, e.g., on a medicated plaster or gauze), soft capsule, hard or soft gelatine, tablet. Due to its characteristics of being able to homogeneously and uniform!y incorporate hydrophilic substances, given by the presence of honey, it also homogeneously and uniformly incorporated into the lipophilic matrix, the composition of the invention is very advantageously suitable as a completely natural base, without any additive, for pharmaceutical, veterinary or cosmetic formulations, medical devices and foods for special medicai purposes {medical foods), and as such represents another aspect of the invention. Furthermore, the composition of the invention could be employed by the technician in the field also as coating of pharmaceutical or veterinary tablets, using the techniques well-known and described in the stats of the art. Moreover, object of the invention is also a pharmaceutical, veterinary or cosmetic formulation or a medical device comprising the composition as described herein and one or more active ingredients and/or adjuvants and/or excipients. Even in the case of formulations, all those formulations that do not contain emulsifiers and/or surfactants are preferred, since, due to the characteristics of the composition of the invention, such ingredients are unnecessary for the incorporation of active ingredients in a homogeneous form. As already mentioned, the composition of the present invention enables a high incorporation of honey into a mainly lipophilic base, resulting in a mass free of dishomogeneities, thereby making pointless the aid of substances such as emulsifiers and/or surfactants also for the incorporation of hydrophilic active ingredients. In order to maintain the above-described characteristics for the composition of the invention, the formulation according to the invention comprises a high percentage of the above-described composition, in particular those embodiments wherein the formulation comprises at least 70%, at least 80% at ieast 90% or at least 95% by weight of said composition are preferred. As mentioned above, the high percentage of composition in the formulations allows to have formuiations having a melting temperature of 36 ± 3 °C or of 36 ± 2 aC. What described above for the compositions is to be considered as comprised in the description of the formulations; therefore, in the formuiations of the invention ai! possible above-described embodiments of the composition will be used. in one embodiment of the invention, the parts by weight of honey of the base composition are >0.1 , or are≥0.5, or are≥1 , or are >5: or are >10; or are >15; or are≥2Q; or are 25 and any intermediate number among those indicated, or even >26, >27, >28, >29, and <30.
