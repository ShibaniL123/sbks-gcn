FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to FGFRl agonists and methods of using the same. BACKGROUND The inability to control blood glucose levels underlies a variety of metabolic conditions. Diabetes is a hyperglycemic syndrome that results from a defect in insulin secretion in response to glucose (type 1 and type 2 diabetes) and decreased insulin effectiveness in stimulating skeletal muscle glucose uptake and in restraining hepatic glucose production (type 2 diabetes). Diabetes it a highly prevalent disease and, although therapeutic options are available for some diabetics, there is an urgent need for additional therapies. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a member of the endocrine FGF subfamily, that includes FGF19 and FGF23, and it has been identified as a potential disease-modifying agent to reverse obesity and obesity-induced hepatosteatosis and hyperglycemia (see, e.g., Kharitonenkov and Larsen, Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 22(3):81-6 (2011); Kharitonenkov et al., J. Clin. Invest. 115: 1627-35 (2005); WO 2010/042747). The endocrine FGF21 protein binds to three FGF receptors (FGFRs 1-3), and improves insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes by these receptors together with their membrane bound co-receptor beta-Klotho. However, its development has been hampered by its poor pharmacokinetics and poor understanding of the biological mechanism of action. Anti-FGFRl antagonist antibodies have also been proposed for the treatment of diabetes (WO 2005/037235). However, the identity of which of the three FGFRs mediates the beneficial metabolic activity of FGF21 has not been discovered. It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.

DEFINITIONS In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word “comprise” or variations such as “comprises” or “comprising” is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention. An “acceptor human framework” for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable domain (VL) framework or a heavy chain variable domain (VH) framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework, as defined below. An acceptor human framework “derived from” a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. In some embodiments, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence. “Affinity” refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, “binding affinity” refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Υ can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following. The term “anti-FGFRl agonist antibody” refers to an antibody that is capable of binding FGFR1 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a therapeutic agent in activating FGFR1. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-FGFRl antibody to an unrelated, non-FGFRl protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to FGFR1 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). hi certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to FGFR1 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of < 1μΜ, < 100 ηΜ, < 10 ηΜ, < 1 ηΜ, <0.1 ηΜ, < 0.01 ηΜ, or < 0.001 ηΜ (e.g. 10'8M or less, e.g. from 10'8M to 10' 13 Μ, e.g., from 10'9Mto 10'13M). The term “antibody” herein is used in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity. An “antibody fragment” refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab', Fab’-SH, F(ab')2; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. The term “chimeric” antibody refers to an antibody in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a particular source or species, while the remainder of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a different source or species. The “class” of an antibody refers to the type of constant domain or constant region possessed by its heavy chain. There are five major classes of antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgGi, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAi, and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. “Effector functions” refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region of an antibody, which vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: Clq binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. Β cell receptor); and Β cell activation. An “effective amount” of an agent, e.g., a pharmaceutical formulation, refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result. The term “Fc region” herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain that contains at least a portion of the constant region. The term includes native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. In one embodiment, a human IgG heavy chain Fc region extends from Cys226, or from Ργο230, to the carboxyl-terminus of the heavy chain. However, the C-terminal lysine (Lys447) of the Fc region may or may not be present. Unless otherwise specified herein, numbering of amino acid residues in the Fc region or constant region is according to the EU numbering system, also called the EU index, as described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 1991. “Framework”or “FR” refers to variable domain residues other than hypervariable region (HVR) residues. The FR of a variable domain generally consists of four FR domains: FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4. Accordingly, the HVR and FR sequences generally appear in the following sequence in VH (or VL): FR1-H1(L1)-FR2-H2(L2)-FR3-H3(L3)-FR4. The terms “full length antibody,” “intact antibody,” and “whole antibody” are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody having a structure substantially similar to a native antibody structure or having heavy chains that contain an Fc region as defined herein. The terms “host cell,” “host cell line,” and “host cell culture” are used interchangeably and refer to cells into which exogenous nucleic acid has been introduced, including the progeny of such cells. Host cells include “transformants” and “transformed cells,” which include the primary transformed cell and progeny derived therefrom without regard to the number of passages. Progeny may not be completely identical in nucleic acid content to a parent cell, but may contain mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened or selected for in the originally transformed cell are included herein. A “human antibody” is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human or a human cell or derived from a non-human source that utilizes human antibody repertoires or other human antibody-encoding sequences. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues. A “human consensus framework” is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda MD (1991), vols. 1-3. In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is subgroup 1Π as in Kabat et al., supra. A “humanized” antibody refers to a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid residues from non-human HVRs and amino acid residues from human FRs. In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the HVRs (e.g., CDRs) correspond to those of a non-human antibody, and all or substantially all of the FRs correspond to those of a human antibody. A humanized antibody optionally may comprise at least a portion of an antibody constant region derived from a human antibody. A “humanized form” of an antibody, e.g., a non-human antibody, refers to an antibody that has undergone humanization. The term “hypervariable region” or “HVR,” as used herein, refers to each of the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and/or form structurally defined loops (“hypervariable loops”). Generally, native four-chain antibodies comprise six HVRs; three in the VH (HI, Η2, Η3), and three in the VL (LI, L2, L3). HVRs generally comprise amino acid residues from the hypervariable loops and/or from the “complementarity determining regions” (CDRs), the latter being of highest sequence variability and/or involved in antigen recognition. Exemplary hypervariable loops occur at amino acid residues 26-32 (LI), 50-52 (L2), 91-96 (L3), 26-32 (HI), 53-55 (Η2), and 96-101 (Η3). (Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987).) Exemplary CDRs (CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3, CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3) occur at amino acid residues 24-34 of LI, 50-56 of L2, 89-97 of L3, 31-35Β of HI, 50-65 of Η2, and 95-102 of Η3. (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (1991).) With the exception of CDR1 in VH, CDRs generally comprise the amino acid residues that form the hypervariable loops. CDRs also comprise “specificity determining residues,” or “SDRs,” which are residues that contact antigen. SDRs are contained within regions of the CDRs called abbreviated-CDRs, or a-CDRs. Exemplary a-CDRs (a-CDR-Ll, a-CDR-L2, a-CDR-L3, a-CDR-Hl, a-CDR-H2, and a-CDR-H3) occur at amino acid residues 31-34 of LI, 50-55 of L2, 89-96 of L3, 31-35Β of HI, 50-58 of Η2, and 95-102 of Η3. (See Almagro and Fransson, Front. Biosci. 13:1619-1633 (2008).) Unless otherwise indicated, HVR residues and other residues in the variable domain (e.g., FR residues) are numbered herein according to Rabat et al., supra. An “immunoconjugate” is an antibody conjugated to one or more heterologous molecule(s). An “individual” or “subject” is a mammal. Mammals include, but are not limited to, domesticated animals (e.g., cows, sheep, cats, dogs, and horses), primates (e.g., humans and non-human primates such as monkeys), rabbits, and rodents (e.g., mice and rats). In certain embodiments, the individual or subject is a human. An “isolated” antibody is one which has been separated from a component of its natural environment. In some embodiments, an antibody is purified to greater than 95% or 99% purity as determined by, for example, electrophoretic (e.g., SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing (IEF), capillary electrophoresis) or chromatographic (e.g., ion exchange or reverse phase HPLC). For review of methods for assessment of antibody purity, see, e.g., Flatman et al., J. Chromatogr. Β 848:79-87 (2007). An “isolated” nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid molecule that has been separated from a component of its natural environment. An isolated nucleic acid includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily contain the nucleic acid molecule, but the nucleic acid molecule is present extrachromosomally or at a chromosomal location that is different from its natural chromosomal location. “Isolated nucleic acid encoding an anti-FGFRl antibody” refers to one or more nucleic acid molecules encoding antibody heavy and light chains (or fragments thereof), including such nucleic acid molecule(s) in a single vector or separate vectors, and such nucleic acid molecule(s) present at one or more locations in a host cell. The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variant antibodies, e.g., containing naturally occurring mutations or arising during production of a monoclonal antibody preparation, such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. Thus, the modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including but not limited to the hybridoma method, recombinant DNA methods, phage-display methods, and methods utilizing transgenic animals containing all or part of the human immunoglobulin loci, such methods and other exemplary methods for making monoclonal antibodies being described herein. “Native antibodies” refer to naturally occurring immunoglobulin molecules with varying structures. For example, native IgG antibodies are heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains that are disulfide-bonded. From Ν- to C-terminus, each heavy chain has a variable region (VH), also called a variable heavy domain or a heavy chain variable domain, followed by three constant domains (CHI, CH2, and CH3). Similarly, from Ν- to C-terminus, each light chain has a variable region (VL), also called a variable light domain or a light chain variable domain, followed by a constant light (CL) domain. The light chain of an antibody may be assigned to one of two types, called kappa (κ) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequence of its constant domain. The term “package insert” is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, combination therapy, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. “Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein, however, % amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program is publicly available from Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, California, or may be compiled from the source code. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, including digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary. In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence Β (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence Β) is calculated as follows: 100 times the fraction Χ/Υ where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program’s alignment of A and Β, and where Υ is the total number of amino acid residues in Β. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence Β, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to Β will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of Β to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN-2 computer program. The term "pharmaceutical formulation" refers to a preparation which is in such form as to permit the biological activity of an active ingredient contained therein to be effective, and which contains no additional components which are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the formulation would be administered. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to an ingredient in a pharmaceutical formulation, other than an active ingredient, which is nontoxic to a subject. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes, but is not limited to, a buffer, excipient, stabilizer, or preservative. The term “Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 or FGFR1,” as used herein, refers to any native FGFR1 from any vertebrate source, including mammals such as primates (e.g. humans) and rodents (e.g., mice and rats), unless otherwise indicated. The term encompasses “full-length,” unprocessed FGFR1 as well as any form of FGFR1 that results from processing in the cell. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of FGFR1, e.g., splice variants or allelic variants. The amino acid sequence of exemplary human FGFRlb and FGFR2b, respectively, are shown below: ΝΤΚΡΝΡ V ΑΡ YWT SPEKMEKKLH A VP ΑΑΚΤ VKFKCP S S GTPNPTLRWLKN GK EFKPDHRIGGYKVRY ATW SIIMD S VVP SDKGNYTCIVENEY GSINHT Υ QLD VVERSPH RPILQAGLPANKTVALGSNVEFMCKVYSDPQPHIQWLKHIEVNGSKIGPDNLPYVQIL KHS GIN S SD ΑΕ VLTLFN VTE AQ S GE Υ V CK V SN YIGE AN Q S AWLT VTRP V ΑΚ ALEERP AVMTS (SEQ ID NO: 1); and ΝΤΚΡΝΡ V ΑΡ YWT SPEKMEKKLH A VP ΑΑΚΤ VKFKCP S S GTPNPTLRWLKN GK EFKPDHRIGGYKVRY ATW SIIMD S VVP SDKGNYTCIVENEY GSINHT Υ QLD VVERSPH RPILQAGLPANKTVALGSNVEFMCKVYSDPQPHIQWLKHIEVNGSKIGPDNLPYVQIL KTAGVNTTDKEMEVLHLRNV SFED AGEYTCLAGN SIGLSHHS AWLTVLEALEERP A VMTS (SEQ ID NO: 5). As used herein, “treatment” (and grammatical variations thereof such as “treat” or “treating”) refers to clinical intervention in an attempt to alter the natural course of the individual being treated, and can be performed either for prophylaxis or during the course of clinical pathology. Desirable effects of treatment include, but are not limited to, preventing occurrence or recurrence of disease, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of any direct or indirect pathological consequences of the disease, decreasing the rate of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and improved prognosis. In some embodiments, antibodies of the invention are used to delay development of a disease or to slow the progression of a disease. The term “variable region” or “variable domain” refers to the domain of an antibody heavy or light chain that is involved in binding the antibody to antigen. The variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain (VH and VL, respectively) of a native antibody generally have similar structures, with each domain comprising four conserved framework regions (FRs) and three hypervariable regions (HVRs). (See, e.g., Kindt et al. Kuby Immunology, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Co., page 91 (2007).) A single VH or VL domain may be sufficient to confer antigen-binding specificity. Furthermore, antibodies that bind a particular antigen may be isolated using a VH or VL domain from an antibody that binds the antigen to screen a library of complementary VL or VH domains, respectively. See, e.g., Portolano et al., J. Immunol. 150:880-887 (1993); Clarkson et al., Nature 352:624-628 (1991). The term "vector," as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of propagating another nucleic acid to which it is linked. The term includes the vector as a selfreplicating nucleic acid structure as well as the vector incorporated into the genome of a host cell into which it has been introduced. Certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of nucleic acids to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as "expression vectors." II. COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS In one aspect, the invention is based, in part, on the discovery of anti-FGFRl agonistic antibodies and the therapeutic activity of such antibodies. Antibodies of the invention are useful, e.g., for the treatment of metabolic diseases, including diabetes. A. Exemplary Anti-FGFRl Antibodies In one aspect, the invention provides isolated antibodies that bind to FGFR1. In certain embodiments, an anti-FGFRl antibody binds to FGFRlb and/or FGFRlc and agonizes FGFR1 activity. In one aspect, the invention provides an anti-FGFRl antibody comprising at least one, two, three, four, five, or six HVRs selected from (a) HVR-H1 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 26; (b) HVR-H2 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 25; (c) HVR-H3 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 or SEQ ID NO: 20; (d) HVR-L1 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 21; (℮) HVR-L2 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 22; and (f) HVR-L3 comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 23. In some embodiments, an anti-FGFRl antibody may be fully human, humanized or non-human. In one embodiment, an anti-FGFRl antibody comprises HVRs as in any of the above embodiments, and further comprises an acceptor human framework, e.g. a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework. In another aspect, an anti-FGFRl antibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain (VH) sequence having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 3 or 4 as follows: EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFTSTWISWVPGKGLEWVGEIDPYDGDTYY ADSVKGRFTISADTSKNLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCASSGYGGSDYAMDYWGQ (SEQ ID NO: 2), EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSNNYIHWVPGKGLEWVADIYPNDGDTD YADS VKGRFTIS ADTSKNLQMN SLRAEDTAVYY C AREHFD AWVHYYVMDYW GQ (SEQ ID NO: 3), and EVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFTSNWISWVPGKGLEWVAEIDPYDGATD YADSVKGRFTISADTSKNLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCATGTDVMDYWGQ (SEQ ID NO: 4). In certain embodiments, a VH sequence having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity contains substitutions (e.g., conservative substitutions), insertions, or deletions relative to the reference sequence, but an anti-FGFRl antibody comprising that sequence retains the ability to bind to FGFR1 and to agonize its activity. In certain embodiments, a total of 1 to 10 amino acids have been substituted, inserted and/or deleted in SEQ ID NO: 2, 3 or 4. In certain embodiments, substitutions, insertions, or deletions occur in regions outside the HVRs (i.e., in the FRs). Optionally, the anti- FGFR1 antibody comprises the VH sequence in SEQ ID NO: 2, 3 or 4, including post-translational modifications of that sequence. In another aspect, an anti-FGFRl antibody is provided, wherein the antibody comprises a light chain variable domain (VL) having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 as follows: DIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITCRASQDVSTAVAWYQQKPGKAPKLLIYSASFLYSG VPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLQPEDFATYYCQQSYTTPPTFGQGTKVEIKR (SEQ ID NO: 6). In certain embodiments, a VL sequence having at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity contains substitutions (e.g., conservative substitutions), insertions, or deletions relative to the reference sequence, but an anti-FGFRl antibody comprising that sequence retains the ability to bind to FGFR1. In certain embodiments, a total of 1 to 10 amino acids have been substituted, inserted and/or deleted in SEQ ID NO: 6. In certain embodiments, the substitutions, insertions, or deletions occur in regions outside the HVRs (i.e., in the FRs). Optionally, the anti-FGFRl antibody comprises the VL sequence in SEQ ID NO: 6, including post-translational modifications of that sequence. In another aspect, an anti-FGFRl antibody is provided, wherein the antibody comprises a VH as in any of the embodiments provided above, and a VL as in any of the embodiments provided above. In one embodiment, the antibody comprises the VH and VL sequences in SEQ ID NO: 2, 3 or 4 and SEQ ID NO: 6, respectively, including post-translational modifications of those sequences. In a further aspect of the invention, an anti-FGFRl antibody according to any of the above embodiments is a monoclonal antibody, including a chimeric, humanized or human antibody. In one embodiment, an anti-FGFRl antibody is an antibody fragment, e.g., a Fv, Fab, Fab’, scFv, diabody, or F(ab’)2 fragment. In another embodiment, the antibody is a full length antibody, e.g., an intact IgGl antibody or other antibody class or isotype as defined herein. In a further aspect, an anti-FGFRl antibody according to any of the above embodiments may incorporate any of the features, singly or in combination, as described in Sections 1-7 below: 1. Antibody Affinity In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein has a dissociation constant (Kd) of < 1μΜ, < 100 ηΜ, < 10 ηΜ, < 1 ηΜ, < 0.1 ηΜ, < 0.01 ηΜ, or < 0.001 ηΜ (e.g. 10'8M or less, e.g. from 10'8Mto 10'13M, e.g., from 10'9Mto 10'13 Μ). In one embodiment, Kd is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay (RIA) performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay. Solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (125I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881(1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER® multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 pg/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23°C). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 ρΜ or 26 ρΜ [125I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20®) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 pl/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20 ™; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT ™ gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIACORE®-2000 or a BIACORE ®-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 25°C with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at ~10 response units (RU). Briefly, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with Ν-ethyl-A’- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and Νhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier’s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 pg/ml (~0.2 μΜ) before injection at a flow rate of 5 pl/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 Μ ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 ηΜ to 500 ηΜ) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20™) surfactant (PBST) at 25°C at a flow rate of approximately 25 pl/min. Association rates (kon) and dissociation rates (k0ff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE® Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k0ff/kon See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10^ M'l s'l by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation = 295 nm; emission = 340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25°C of a 20 ηΜ anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO ™ spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette. 2. Antibody Fragments In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is an antibody fragment. Antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab’, Fab’-SH, F(ab’)2, Fv, and scFv fragments, and other fragments described below. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003). For a review of scFv fragments, see, e.g., Pluckthiin, in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., (Springer-Verlag, New York), ρρ. 269-315 (1994); see also WO 93/16185; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,571,894 and 5,587,458. For discussion of Fab and F(ab')2 fragments comprising salvage receptor binding epitope residues and having increased in vivo half-life, see U.S. Patent No. 5,869,046. Diabodies are antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites that may be bivalent or bispecific. See, for example, ΕΡ 404,097; WO 1993/01161; Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003); and Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 6444-6448 (1993). Triabodies and tetrabodies are also described in Hudson et al., Nat. Med. 9:129-134 (2003). Single-domain antibodies are antibody fragments comprising all or a portion of the heavy chain variable domain or all or a portion of the light chain variable domain of an antibody. In certain embodiments, a single-domain antibody is a human single-domain antibody (Domantis, Inc., Waltham, ΜΑ; see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,248,516 Bl). Antibody fragments can be made by various techniques, including but not limited to proteolytic digestion of an intact antibody as well as production by recombinant host cells (e.g. Ε. coli or phage), as described herein. 3. Chimeric and Humanized Antibodies In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a chimeric antibody. Certain chimeric antibodies are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 81:6851-6855 (1984)). In one example, a chimeric antibody comprises a non-human variable region (e.g., a variable region derived from a mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, or non-human primate, such as a monkey) and a human constant region. In a further example, a chimeric antibody is a “class switched” antibody in which the class or subclass has been changed from that of the parent antibody. Chimeric antibodies include antigen-binding fragments thereof. In certain embodiments, a chimeric antibody is a humanized antibody. Typically, a non-human antibody is humanized to reduce immunogenicity to humans, while retaining the specificity and affinity of the parental non-human antibody. Generally, a humanized antibody comprises one or more variable domains in which HVRs, e.g., CDRs, (or portions thereof) are derived from a non-human antibody, and FRs (or portions thereof) are derived from human antibody sequences. A humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of a human constant region. In some embodiments, some FR residues in a humanized antibody are substituted with corresponding residues from a non-human antibody (e.g., the antibody from which the HVR residues are derived), e.g., to restore or improve antibody specificity or affinity. Humanized antibodies and methods of making them are reviewed, e.g., in Almagro and Fransson, Front. Biosci. 13:1619-1633 (2008), and are further described, e.g., in Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); Queen et al., Proc. Nat’l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033 (1989); US Patent Nos. 5, 821,337, 7,527,791, 6,982,321, and 7,087,409; Kashmiri et αℓ., Methods 36:25-34 (2005) (describing SDR (a-CDR) grafting); Padlan, Mol. Immunol. 28:489-498 (1991) (describing “resurfacing”); Dall’Acqua et al., Methods 36:43-60 (2005) (describing “FR shuffling”); and Osbourn et al., Methods 36:61-68 (2005) and Klimka et al., Br. J. Cancer, 83:252-260 (2000) (describing the “guided selection” approach to FR shuffling). Human framework regions that may be used for humanization include but are not limited to: framework regions selected using the "best-fit" method (see, e.g., Sims et al. J. Immunol. 151:2296 (1993)); framework regions derived from the consensus sequence of human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chain variable regions (see, e.g., Carter et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); and Presta et al. J. Immunol., 151:2623 (1993)); human mature (somatically mutated) framework regions or human germline framework regions (see, e.g., Almagro and Fransson, Front. Biosci. 13:1619-1633 (2008)); and framework regions derived from screening FR libraries (see, e.g., Baca et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:10678-10684 (1997) and Rosok et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:22611-22618 (1996)). 4. Human Antibodies In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a human antibody. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. Human antibodies are described generally in van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 5: 368-74 (2001) and Lonberg, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 20:450-459 (2008). Human antibodies may be prepared by administering an immunogen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce intact human antibodies or intact antibodies with human variable regions in response to antigenic challenge. Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci, which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci, or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal’s chromosomes. In such transgenic mice, the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals, see Lonberg, Nat. Biotech. 23:1117-1125 (2005). See also, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 describing XENOMOUSE™ technology; U.S. Patent No. 5,770,429 describing HuMab® technology; U.S. Patent No. 7,041,870 describing Κ-Μ MOUSE® technology, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2007/0061900, describing VELOCIMOUSE® technology). Human variable regions from intact antibodies generated by such animals may be further modified, e.g., by combining with a different human constant region. Human antibodies can also be made by hybridoma-based methods. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described. (See, e.g., Kozbor J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, ρρ. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boemer et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991).) Human antibodies generated via human B-cell hybridoma technology are also described in Li et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006). Additional methods include those described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 7,189,826 (describing production of monoclonal human IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines) and Ni, Xiandai Mianyixue, 26(4):265-268 (2006) (describing human-human hybridomas). Human hybridoma technology (Trioma technology) is also described in Vollmers and Brandiein, Histology andHistopathology, 20(3):927-937 (2005) and Vollmers and Brandlein, Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, 27(3): 185-91 (2005). Human antibodies may also be generated by isolating Fv clone variable domain sequences selected from human-derived phage display libraries. Such variable domain sequences may then be combined with a desired human constant domain. Techniques for selecting human antibodies from antibody libraries are described below. 5. Library-Derived Antibodies Antibodies of the invention may be isolated by screening combinatorial libraries for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O’Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2001) and further described, e.g., in the McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-554; Clackson et al., Nature 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597 (1992); Marks and Bradbury, in Methods in Molecular Biology 248:161-175 (Lo, ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003); Sidhu et al., J. Mol. Biol. 338(2): 299-310 (2004); Lee et al., J. Mol. Biol. 340(5): 1073-1093 (2004); Fellouse, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101(34): 12467-12472 (2004); and Lee et al., J. Immunol. Methods 284(1-2): 119-132 (2004). In certain phage display methods, repertoires of VH and VL genes are separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and recombined randomly in phage libraries, which can then be screened for antigen-binding phage as described in Winter et al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994). Phage typically display antibody fragments, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned (e.g., from human) to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., ΕΜΒΟ J, 12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro, as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992). Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: US Patent No. 5,750,373, and US Patent Publication Antibodies or antibody fragments isolated from human antibody libraries are considered human antibodies or human antibody fragments herein. 6. Multispecific Antibodies In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a multispecific antibody, e.g. a bispecific antibody. Multispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for FGFR1 and the other is for any other antigen, e.g. beta-Klotho. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of FGFR1. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments. Techniques for making multispecific antibodies include, but are not limited to, recombinant co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs having different specificities (see Milstein and Cuello, Nature 305: 537 (1983)), WO 93/08829, and Traunecker et al., ΕΜΒΟ J. 10: 3655 (1991)), and “knob-in-hole” engineering (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,731,168). Multi-specific antibodies may also be made by engineering electrostatic steering effects for making antibody Fc-heterodimeric molecules (WO 2009/089004Α1); cross-linking two or more antibodies or fragments (see, e.g., US Patent No. 4,676,980, and Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985)); using leucine zippers to produce bi-specific antibodies (see, e.g., Kostelny et al., J. Immunol., 148(5): 1547-1553 (1992)); using "diabody" technology for making bispecific antibody fragments (see, e.g., Hollinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:6444-6448 (1993)); and using single-chain Fv (sFv) dimers (see, e.g., Gruber et al., J. Immunol., 152:5368 (1994)); and preparing trispecific antibodies as described, e.g., in Tutt et al. J. Immunol. 147: 60 (1991). Engineered antibodies with three or more functional antigen binding sites, including “Octopus antibodies,” are also included herein (see, e.g. US 2006/0025576Α1). The antibody or fragment herein also includes a “Dual Acting FAb” or “DAF” comprising an antigen binding site that binds to FGFR1 as well as another, different antigen, e.g. klothoBeta (see, US 2008/0069820, for example). 7. Antibody Variants In certain embodiments, amino acid sequence variants of the antibodies provided herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of an antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate modifications into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics, e.g., antigen-binding. a) Substitution, Insertion, and Deletion Variants In certain embodiments, antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided. Sites of interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the HVRs and FRs. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of "conservative substitutions." More substantial changes are provided in Table 1 under the heading of "exemplary substitutions," and as further described below in reference to amino acid side chain classes. Amino acid substitutions may be introduced into an antibody of interest and the products screened for a desired activity, e.g., retained/improved antigen binding, decreased immunogenicity, or improved ADCC or CDC. Original Residue Exemplary Substitutions Preferred Substitutions Ala (A) Val; Leu; lie Val Arg (R) Lys; Gin; Asn Lys Asn (Ν) Gin; His; Asp, Lys; Arg Gin Asp (D) Glu; Asn Glu Cys (C) Ser; Ala Ser Gin (Q) Asn; Glu Asn Glu (Ε) Asp; Gin Asp Gly(G) Ala Ala His (Η) Asn; Gin; Lys; Arg Arg lie (I) Leu; Val; Met; Ala; Phe; Norleucine Leu TABLE 1 Original Residue Exemplary Substitutions Preferred Substitutions Leu (L) Norleucine; lie; Val; Met; Ala; Phe He Lys (Κ) Arg; Gin; Asn Arg Met (Μ) Leu; Phe; lie Leu Phe (F) Trp; Leu; Val; He; Ala; Tyr Tyr Pro (Ρ) Ala Ala Ser (S) Thr Thr Thr (Τ) Val; Ser Ser Trp (W) Tyr; Phe Tyr Tyr (Υ) Trp; Phe; Thr; Ser Phe Val (V) He; Leu; Met; Phe; Ala; Norleucine Leu Amino acids may be grouped according to common side-chain properties: (1) hydrophobic: Norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, lie; (2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gin; (3) acidic: Asp, Glu; (4) basic: His, Lys, Arg; (5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; (6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe. Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody (e.g. a humanized or human antibody). Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further study will have modifications (e.g., improvements) in certain biological properties (e.g., increased affinity, reduced immunogenicity) relative to the parent antibody and/or will have substantially retained certain biological properties of the parent antibody. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody, which may be conveniently generated, e.g., using phage display-based affinity maturation techniques such as those described herein. Briefly, one or more HVR residues are mutated and the variant antibodies displayed on phage and screened for a particular biological activity (e.g. binding affinity). Alterations (e.g., substitutions) may be made in HVRs, e.g., to improve antibody affinity. Such alterations may be made in HVR “hotspots,” i.e., residues encoded by codons that undergo mutation at high frequency during the somatic maturation process (see, e.g., Chowdhury, Methods Mol. Biol. 207:179-196 (2008)), and/or SDRs (a-CDRs), with the resulting variant VH or VL being tested for binding affinity. Affinity maturation by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries has been described, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O’Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, NJ, (2001).) In some embodiments of affinity maturation, diversity is introduced into the variable genes chosen for maturation by any of a variety of methods (e.g., error-prone PCR, chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis). A secondary library is then created. The library is then screened to identify any antibody variants with the desired affinity. Another method to introduce diversity involves HVR-directed approaches, in which several HVR residues (e.g., 4-6 residues at a time) are randomized. HVR residues involved in antigen binding may be specifically identified, e.g., using alanine scanning mutagenesis or modeling. CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 in particular are often targeted. In certain embodiments, substitutions, insertions, or deletions may occur within one or more HVRs so long as such alterations do not substantially reduce the ability of the antibody to bind antigen. For example, conservative alterations (e.g., conservative substitutions as provided herein) that do not substantially reduce binding affinity may be made in HVRs. Such alterations may be outside of HVR “hotspots” or SDRs. In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided above, each HVR either is unaltered, or contains no more than one, two or three amino acid substitutions. A useful method for identification of residues or regions of an antibody that may be targeted for mutagenesis is called "alanine scanning mutagenesis" as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085. In this method, a residue or group of target residues (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) are identified and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to determine whether the interaction of the antibody with antigen is affected. Further substitutions may be introduced at the amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the initial substitutions. Alternatively, or additionally, a crystal structure of an antigen-antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues may be targeted or eliminated as candidates for substitution. Variants may be screened to determine whether they contain the desired properties. Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the Ν- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody. b) Glycosylation variants In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to an antibody may be conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more glycosylation sites is created or removed. Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched, biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N-linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See, e.g., Wright et al. TIBTECH 15:26-32 (1997). The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates, e.g., mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose, and sialic acid, as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the “stem” of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments, modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties. In one embodiment, antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached (directly or indirectly) to an Fc region. For example, the amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 65%, from 5% to 65% or from 20% to 40%. The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297, relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 (℮. g. complex, hybrid and high mannose structures) as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described in WO 2008/077546, for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region (Eu numbering of Fc region residues); however, Asn297 may also be located about ± 3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e., between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See, e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.); US 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Examples of publications related to “defucosylated” or “fucose-deficient” antibody variants include: US 2003/0157108; WO 2000/61739; WO 2001/29246; US 2003/0115614; US 2002/0164328; US 2004/0093621; US 2004/0132140; US 2004/0110704; US 2004/0110282; US 2004/0109865; WO 2003/085119; WO 2003/084570; WO 2005/035586; WO 2005/035778; W02005/053742; W02002/031140; Okazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol. 336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004). Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lecl3 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249:533-545 (1986); US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 Al, Presta, L; and WO 2004/056312 Al, Adams et αℓ., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (see, e.g., Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004); Kanda, Υ. et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 94(4):680-688 (2006); and W02003/085107). Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides, e.g., in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and/or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 2003/011878 (Jean-Mairet et al.); US Patent No. 6,602,684 (Umana et al.); and US 2005/0123546 (Umana et all). Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 1997/30087 (Patel et al.); WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.); and WO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.). c) Fc region variants In certain embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an antibody provided herein, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions. In certain embodiments, the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks FcyR binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, ΝΚ cells, express Fc(RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc(RI, Fc(RH and Fc(RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 (1991). Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,500,362 (see, e.g. Hellstrom, I. et al. Proc. Nat’l Acad. Sci. USA 83:7059-7063 (1986)) and Hellstrom, I et al., Proc. Nat’l Acad. Sci. USA 82:1499-1502 (1985); 5,821,337 (see Bruggemann, Μ. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1351-1361 (1987)). Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (see, for example, ACTFM non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, CA; and CytoTox 96® non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (ΝΚ) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. Proc. Nat’l Acad. Sci. USA 95:652-656 (1998). Clq binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind Clq and hence lacks CDC activity. See, e.g., Clq and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006/029879 and WO 2005/100402. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, Gazzano-Santoro et αℓ., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996); Cragg, M.S. et al., Blood 101:1045-1052 (2003); and Cragg, M.S. and M.J. Glennie, Blood 103:2738-2743 (2004)). FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Petkova, S.B. et al., Int’l. Immunol. 18(12): 1759-1769 (2006)). Antibodies with reduced effector function include those with substitution of one or more of Fc region residues 238, 265, 269, 270, 297, 327 and 329 (U.S. Patent No. 6,737,056). Such Fc mutants include Fc mutants with substitutions at two or more of amino acid positions 265, 269, 270, 297 and 327, including the so-called “DANA” Fc mutant with substitution of residues 265 and 297 to alanine (US Patent No. 7,332,581). Certain antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs are described. (See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,737,056; WO 2004/056312, and Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 9(2): 6591-6604 (2001).) In certain embodiments, an antibody variant comprises an Fc region with one or more amino acid substitutions which improve ADCC, e.g., substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (EU numbering of residues). In some embodiments, alterations are made in the Fc region that result in altered (i.e., either improved or diminished) Clq binding and/or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), e.g., as described in US Patent No. 6,194,551, WO 99/51642, and Idusogie et al. J. Immunol. 164: 4178-4184 (2000). Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., J. Immunol. 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., J. Immunol. 24:249 (1994)), are described in US2005/0014934A1 (Hinton et al.). Those antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Such Fc variants include those with substitutions at one or more of Fc region residues: 238, 256, 265, 272, 286, 303, 305, 307, 311, 312, 317, 340, 356, 360, 362, 376, 378, 380, 382, 413, 424 or 434, e.g., substitution of Fc region residue 434 (US Patent No. 7,371,826). See also Duncan & Winter, Nature 322:738-40 (1988); U.S. Patent No. 5,648,260; U.S. Patent No. 5,624,821; and WO 94/29351 concerning other examples ofFc region variants. d) Cysteine engineered antibody variants In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to create cysteine engineered antibodies, e.g., “thioMAbs,” in which one or more residues of an antibody are substituted with cysteine residues. In particular embodiments, the substituted residues occur at accessible sites of the antibody. By substituting those residues with cysteine, reactive thiol groups are thereby positioned at accessible sites of the antibody and may be used to conjugate the antibody to other moieties, such as drug moieties or linker-drug moieties, to create an immunoconjugate, as described further herein. In certain embodiments, any one or more of the following residues may be substituted with cysteine: V205 (Kabat numbering) of the light chain; Α118 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain; and S400 (EU numbering) of the heavy chain Fc region. Cysteine engineered antibodies may be generated as described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 7,521,541. ℮) Antibody Derivatives In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein may be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. The moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody include but are not limited to water soluble polymers. Non-limiting examples of water soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), copolymers of ethylene glycol/propylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, poly-1, 3-dioxolane, poly-l,3,6-trioxane, ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyaminoacids (either homopolymers or random copolymers), and dextran or poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone)polyethylene glycol, propropylene glycol homopolymers, prolypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight, and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary, and if more than one polymer are attached, they can be the same or different molecules. In general, the number and/or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including, but not limited to, the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved, whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions, etc. In another embodiment, conjugates of an antibody and nonproteinaceous moiety that may be selectively heated by exposure to radiation are provided. In one embodiment, the nonproteinaceous moiety is a carbon nanotube (Kam et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102: 11600-11605 (2005)). The radiation may be of any wavelength, and includes, but is not limited to, wavelengths that do not harm ordinary cells, but which heat the nonproteinaceous moiety to a temperature at which cells proximal to the antibody-nonproteinaceous moiety are killed. Β. Recombinant Methods and Compositions Antibodies may be produced using recombinant methods and compositions, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567. In one embodiment, isolated nucleic acid encoding an anti-FGFRl antibody described herein is provided. Such nucleic acid may encode an amino acid sequence comprising the VL and/or an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody (e.g., the light and/or heavy chains of the antibody). In a further embodiment, one or more vectors (e.g., expression vectors) comprising such nucleic acid are provided. In a further embodiment, a host cell comprising such nucleic acid is provided. In one such embodiment, a host cell comprises (e.g., has been transformed with): (1) a vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody, or (2) a first vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VL of the antibody and a second vector comprising a nucleic acid that encodes an amino acid sequence comprising the VH of the antibody. In one embodiment, the host cell is eukaryotic, e.g. a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell or lymphoid cell (e.g., Υ0, NSO, Sp20 cell). In one embodiment, a method of making an anti-FGFRl antibody is provided, wherein the method comprises culturing a host cell comprising a nucleic acid encoding the antibody, as provided above, under conditions suitable for expression of the antibody, and optionally recovering the antibody from the host cell (or host cell culture medium). For recombinant production of an anti-FGFRl antibody, nucleic acid encoding an antibody, e.g., as described above, is isolated and inserted into one or more vectors for further cloning and/or expression in a host cell. Such nucleic acid may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Suitable host cells for cloning or expression of antibody-encoding vectors include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells described herein. For example, antibodies may be produced in bacteria, in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,648,237, 5,789,199, and 5,840,523. (See also Charlton, Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248 (B.K.C. Lo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, 2003), ρρ. 245-254, describing expression of antibody fragments in Ε. coli.) After expression, the antibody may be isolated from the bacterial cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be further purified. In addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors, including fungi and yeast strains whose glycosylation pathways have been “humanized,” resulting in the production of an antibody with a partially or fully human glycosylation pattern. See Gerngross, Nat. Biotech. 22:1409-1414 (2004), and Li et al., Nat. Biotech. 24:210-215 (2006). Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are also derived from multicellular organisms (invertebrates and vertebrates). Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains have been identified which may be used in conjunction with insect cells, particularly for transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Plant cell cultures can also be utilized as hosts. See, e.g., US Patent Nos. 5,959,177, 6,040,498, 6,420,548, 7,125,978, and 6,417,429 (describing PLANTffiODIES™ technology for producing antibodies in transgenic plants). Vertebrate cells may also be used as hosts. For example, mammalian cell lines that are adapted to grow in suspension may be useful. Other examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells as described, e.g., in Graham et al., J. Gen Virol. 36:59 (1977)); baby hamster kidney cells (ΒΗΚ); mouse sertoli cells (ΤΜ4 cells as described, e.g., in Mather, Biol. Reprod. 23:243-251 (1980)); monkey kidney cells (CV1); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA); canine kidney cells (MDCK; buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3 A); human lung cells (W138); human liver cells (Hep G2); mouse mammary tumor (ΜΜΤ 060562); TRI cells, as described, e.g., in Mather et al., Annals Ν.Υ. Acad. Sci. 383:44-68 (1982); MRC 5 cells; and FS4 cells. Other useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, including DHFR' CHO cells (Uriaub et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216 (1980)); and myeloma cell lines such as Υ0, NS0 and Sp2/0. For a review of certain mammalian host cell lines suitable for antibody production, see, e.g., Yazaki and Wu, Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 248 (B.K.C. Lo, ed., Humana Press, Totowa, NJ), ρρ. 255-268 (2003). C.

In one embodiment, the method comprises administering to an individual having such metabolic disease an effective amount of an agonistic anti-FGFRl antibody. In one such embodiment, the method further comprises administering to the individual an effective amount of at least one additional therapeutic agent, as described below. An “individual” according to any of the above embodiments may be a human. In a further aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising any of the agonistic anti-FGFRl antibodies provided herein, e.g., for use in any of the above therapeutic methods. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises any of the agonistic anti-FGFRl antibodies provided herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical formulation comprises any of the agonistic anti-FGFRl antibodies provided herein and at least one additional therapeutic agent, e.g., as described below. Antibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other agents in a therapy. For instance, an antibody of the invention may be co-administered with at least one additional therapeutic agent. In certain embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is a glp-1 analog, a synthetic amylin, a glucagon receptor antagonist (e.g. an anti-GCGR antibody), or leptin. Such combination therapies noted above encompass combined administration (where two or more therapeutic agents are included in the same or separate formulations), and separate administration, in which case, administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to, simultaneously, and/or following, administration of the additional therapeutic agent and/or adjuvant. An antibody of the invention (and any additional therapeutic agent) can be administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. Dosing can be by any suitable route, e.g. by injections, such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic. Various dosing schedules including but not limited to single or multiple administrations over various timepoints, bolus administration, and pulse infusion are contemplated herein. Antibodies of the invention would be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as described herein, or about from 1 to 99% of the dosages described herein, or in any dosage and by any route that is empirically/clinically determined to be appropriate. For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention (when used alone or in combination with one or more other additional therapeutic agents) will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the type of antibody, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 pg/kg to 15 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1 mg/kg-lOmg/kg) of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 pg/kg to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment would generally be sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. Thus, one or more doses of about 0.5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (or any combination thereof) may be administered to the patient. Such doses may be administered intermittently, e.g. every week or every three weeks (e.g. such that the patient receives from about two to about twenty, or e.g. about six doses of the antibody). An initial higher loading dose, followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays. Η.

It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes. III. EXAMPLES The following are examples of methods and compositions of the invention. It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced, given the general description provided above. Example 1, Generation and characterization of anti-FGFRl agonist antibodies. We generated monoclonal antibodies specific to FGFR1 using phage display technology and His-tagged IgD2-D3 of human FGFRlb and c as antigens. Human phage antibody libraries with synthetic diversities in the selected complementary determining regions (HI, Η2, Η3, L3), mimicking the natural diversity of human IgG repertoire were used for panning. The Fab fragments were displayed bivalently on the surface of Μ13 bacteriophage particles (Lee et al., J. Immunol. Methods 284:119-32 (2004)). The panning protocol was described previously (Liang et al., J. Mol. Biol. 366:815-29 (2007)). After screening many clones from multiple libraries, unique and specific phage antibodies that bind to both b and c isoforms of FGFR1 were identified by phage ELISA. To test binding of the antibodies to human FGFRs, conventional ELISA protocol was employed using 2 pg/ml of FGFR1 ECD-human Fc chimeric proteins. We also measured binding affinities of anti-FGFRl antibodies to FGFR1 were measured by Biacore/SPR using a BIAcore™ Τ100 instrument as described (Liang et al., supra) with the following modifications. Mouse anti-human Fc antibody was first coated on a BIAcore™ carboxymethylated dextran CM5 chip using direct coupling to free amino groups following a procedure described by the manufacturer. Antibody was then captured on CM5 biosensor chips to achieve approximately 200 response units (RU). Binding measurements were performed using a running buffer composed of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% surfactant Ρ20 (HBS-P buffer). A 2-fold dilution series of FGFR1 ECD-His protein was injected in a range of 1.550 ηΜ in HBS Ρ buffer at a flow rate of 30 pL/minute at 25°C. Association rates (Κοη, per mol/s) and dissociation rates (Koff, per s) were calculated using a simple one-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore™ Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd, per mol) was calculated as the ratio of Koff / Κοη. Two of the anti-FGFRl antibodies which were identified as described above in independent experiments (designated here as RlMAbl and RlMAb2) bind to FGFRlb and FGFRlc at a similar affinity, but not to any other FGFR isoforms (Fig. 1A and Β). Their signaling activity was tested using a Gal-Elkl based luciferase assay in rat L6 cells lacking endogenous FGFRs, but transfected to express each FGFR isoform (and KLB as necessary). These antibodies were unexpectedly potent agonists: both RIMAbs induced luciferase activity in a dose dependent manner, but only when cells express recombinant FGFRlb or FGFRlc, indicating that RIMAbs act as specific agonist for FGFR1 (Fig. 1C). In this assay format, RIMAbs did not appreciably affect activity of basic FGF (bFGF), a classical FGFR1 ligand (Fig. ID). However, RIMAbs and FGF21 showed an additive effect when cells express FGFRlc and KLB (Fig. ID). F(ab’)2 but not Fab fragment of RlMAb2 showed FGFR1-dependent agonistic activity, suggesting that the RIMAbs exert their agonistic activity by promoting homodimerization of FGFR1 (Fig. IE). Previously, an artificial FGFR dimerizing agonist containing an FGFRl-binding peptide and the c-jun leucine zipper domain had been reported. This molecule called C19jun also binds to heparin through the c-jun domain and requires heparin for FGFR1 activation (Ballinger et al., Nature Biotechnol. 17: 1199-1204 (1999)). In contrast, heparin did not affect agonistic activity of RlMAbl in the luciferase assay (Fig. 5). Heparin-independent agonistic activity of the RlMAbl was further confirmed by examining phosphorylation of ERK and ΜΕΚ1/2, signaling components downstream of FGFRs, in cultured murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. IF) or in WAT of C57BL/6 mice injected intraperitoneally with RIMAb (Fig. 1G). We performed experiments to map the FGFR1 epitope bound by RlMAbl and RlMAb2. We synthesized 30 peptides represented portions of the FGFR1 sequence with an amino-terminal biotin tag and used them for ELISA binding assays. These sequences of the peptides were as follows: #1: SSSEEKETDNTKPNPVΑΡΥ (SEQ ID NO: 36); #2: Ρ V ΑΡ YWT SPEKMEKKLH A V (SEQ ID NO: 37); #3: KLH A VP A ΑΚΤ VKFKCP S S G (SEQ ID NO: 38); #4: CPSSGTPNPTLRWLKNGKE (SEQ ID NO: 39); #5: ΚΝGKEFKPDHRIGGYK VRY (SEQ ID NO: 40); #6: YKVRYATWSIEVEDSVVPSD (SEQ ID NO: 41); #7: VVPSDKGNYTCIVENEYGS (SEQ ID NO: 42); #8: ΝΕΥGSINHTΥQLDVVERSP (SEQ ID NO: 43); #9: VERSPHRPILQAGLPANKT (SEQ ID NO: 44); #10: PANKTVALGSNVEFMCKVY (SEQ ID NO: 45); #11: MCKVYSDPQPHIQWLKHIE (SEQ ID NO: 46); #12: LKHIEVNGSKIGPDNLPΥV (SEQ ID NO: 47); #13: NLPYVQILKTAGVNTTDKE (SEQ ID NO: 48); #14: TTDKEMEVLHLRNVSFEDA (SEQ ID NO: 49); #15: SFEDAGEΥΤCLAGNSIGLS (SEQ ID NO: 50); #16: SIGLSHHSAWLTVLEALEE (SEQ ID NO: 51); #17: YWT SPEKMEKKLH A VP ΑΑΚ (SEQ ID NO: 52); #18: EKMEKKLHAVPAAKTVKFK (SEQ ID NO: 53); #19: PAAKTVKFKCPSSGTPNPT (SEQ ID NO: 54); #20: KFKCP S S GTPNP TLRWLKN (SEQ ID NO: 55); #21: GTPNPTLRWLKNGKEFKPD (SEQ ID NO: 56); #22: TLRWLKNGKEFKPDHRIGG (SEQ ID NO: 57); #23: FKPDHRIGGYKVRYATWSI (SEQ ID NO: 58); #24: HRIGGYKVRYATWSIEVEDS (SEQ ID NO: 59); #25: LH A VP A ΑΚΤ VKFKCP S S (SEQ ID NO: 60); #26: KLHAVPAAKTVKFKCP (SEQ ID NO: 28); #27: A VP A ΑΚΤ VKFKCP S S G (SEQ ID NO: 61) ; #28: FKPDHRIGGYKVRY (SEQ ID NO: 29); #29: KPDHRIGGYKVR (SEQ ID NO: 62) ; #30: GTPNP TLRWLKN (SEQ ID NO: 63). As shown in Fig. 17Α, for both RlMAbl and RlMAb2 the shortest peptides to which they demonstrated significant binding were peptides #26 and #28. Example 2, RIMAbs demonstrate sustained anti-diabetic activity. We tested whether the anti-FGFRl antibodies of the invention would have anti-diabetic activity using mouse models of diabetes. All the mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and maintained in a pathogen-free animal facility at 21°C under standard 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle with access to chow (a standard rodent chow (Labdiet 5010, 12.7% calories from fat) or a high fat, high carbohydrate diet (Harlan Teklad TD.03584, 58.4% calories from fat) and water ad libitum, db/db mice in C57BLKS/J background were females and other mice were all males. All the mice were used for injection around 9-11 weeks old, except ap2-SREBPlc mice were 8 months old (Fig. 3Ε) or 4 months old (Fig. 3F). For continuous infusion of FGF21 protein, an osmotic pump (Alzet® 2001) was subcutaneously implanted. Glucose levels were measured using OneTouch® Ultra® glucometer. For hepatic lipid analysis, the lipid was extracted according to the Folch method and resuspended in PBS containing 5% Triton Χ-100. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, P-hydroxybutylate (Thermo DMA) and nonesterified fatty acid (Roche) were determined by using enzymatic reactions. Serum insulin levels were determined by ELISA (Crystal Chem). We tested the agonistic activity of the RIMAbs in vitro and in vivo, by injecting hyperglycemic Leptin-resistant db/db mice with 3, 10, and 50 mg/kg (mpk) of RIMAbl. We observed that blood glucose levels were normalized for over a week at all three doses, and the observed glucose-lowering effect was unexpectedly strong and long-lasting, with glucose levels staying lower than the control mice for over 30 days after a single injection (Fig 2Α). This was associated with a transient, but significant decrease in body weight (Fig. 2Α). The glucose lowering effect was likely through an improvement in insulin sensitivity, as serum insulin level was also dramatically decreased by RIMAbl injection (Fig 2Β). We observed a similar RIMAb-induced reduction in blood glucose levels with RlMAb2 (Fig. 6), and in three additional mouse models with marked insulin resistance, Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice, and Ins2Akita mice (Hong et al., Am../. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 293:Ε1687-96 (2007)) (Fig. 2C and 7). Pair-feeding experiments showed that RIMAb-induced weight loss in db/db and Ins2Akita mice is due to a reduction in food intake; however, the observed reduction in blood glucose is largely independent of food intake (Fig. 2D and 6-7). In the pancreas, RIMAbl injection increased insulin positive area per each islet compared with either pair-fed or non-pairfed control mice (Fig. 2Ε and 8). FGFR1 is expressed in pancreatic β cells (Hart et al., Nature 408:864-68 (2000)) and FGF21 promotes β cell function ex vivo (Wente et al., Diabetes 55:2470-78 (2006)); thus activation of FGFR1 in β cells could directly contribute to the increased pancreatic insulin levels. These data demonstrate that activation of FGFR1 (but not FGFR2 or FGFR3) is sufficient to recapitulate anti-diabetic and anti-lipidemic activities of recombinant FGF21. To dissect the importance of the IgG functionalities for RIMAb’s activities, we utilized two types of modifications. A dual mutation (D265A/N297A; DANA) in the Fc region abolishes binding to FcyRs and recruitment of immune effector cells by an IgG molecule (Gong et al., 2005). Neither the agonistic nor anti-diabetic activity of RlMAb2 was affected by the introduction of the DANA mutations; therefore the effector function plays no role in anti-diabetic activity of RlMAb2 (Fig. 9A-C). However, an engineered one-armed (ΟΑ) version of RlMabl (Atwell et al., J. Mol. Biol. 270:26-35 (1997)), lacking one of the Fab fragments (OA-RlMAbl) (Fig. 9Α and D) showed diminished agonistic activity (Fig. 9Ε and F) and failed to reduce blood glucose, body weight, and hepatic and serum lipid levels db/db mice (Fig. 9G and Η), indicating that both the agonistic and anti-diabetic activities of RIMAbs are dependent on Ab bivalency (although we also test bispecific antibodies with only one anti-FGFRl arm (e.g., with an anti-beta-Klotho arm) and confirm that they retain the beneficial attributes of the bivalent anti-FGFRl RIMAbs). These correlations strongly suggest that RIMAb-induced activation of the signaling pathway downstream of FGFR1 likely mediates its anti-diabetic effects. MAbs have emerged as a powerful therapeutic modality for the treatment of a number of human diseases. Our demonstration of potent anti-hyperglycemic and lipid-lowering activities of anti-FGFRl agonistic MAb opens up a novel path towards development of therapeutic MAbs targeting FGFR1 or FGFR1 -containing receptor complex for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related chronic disorders. MAb-based targeting of FGFR1 offers several favorable properties over recombinant FGF21 therapy. First, by their nature, MAbs provide predictable, modulatable, and far superior pharmacokinetics compared to FGF21 or any other non-antibody therapeutic protein. Indeed, we demonstrated that a single i.p. injection at 1-3 mpk of RlMAbl or RlMab2 into db/db mice leads to a remarkably sustained amelioration of hyperglycemia for over 30 days (Fig. 2 and 5). Such a long-lasting glycemic effect has never been reported for any of the previously described anti-diabetic agents. Example 3, Importance of adipose tissues in diabetic action of RIMAb and FGF21, Recombinant FGF21 has been suggested to improve insulin sensitivity through adipose tissues and the liver (Berglund et al., Endocrinology 150:4084-93 (2009); Li et al., FEBSLetters 583:3230-34 (2009)). FGF21 injection into mice induced ΜΕΚ and ERK phosphorylation in four KLB-expressing tissue types, the liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), and pancreas, as previously reported (Fig. 3A, top) (Kurosu et al., J. Biol. Chem. 282: 26687-95 (2007); Xu et al., Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metah. 297(5): El 105-14 (2009)). In contrast, RlMAbl injection leads to phosphorylation of the same downstream effectors in adipose tissues and pancreas, but not in the liver (Fig. 4Α, bottom), consistent with very low FGFR1 mRNA expression in the liver (Fig. 10) (Fon Tacer et ∂1.,Μοℓ. Endocrinol. 24(10): 2050-64 (2010)). Indeed, a side-by-side comparison of hepatic gene expression revealed that expression of two previously identified FGF21-targeted genes (leptin receptor (LepR) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2); Coskun et al., Endocrinology 149:6018-27 (2008), Inagaki et al., Cell Metabolism 8:77-83 (2008)) were induced by FGF21 but not by RlMAbl (Fig. 15). On the other hand, hepatic expression of known insulin regulated genes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), elongase of long chain fatty acids family 6 (Ε1ον16), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)- binding protein (IGFBP)-l, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)) was similarly altered by both FGF21 and RlMAbl, suggesting that these genes might be regulated indirectly via hormonal (e.g. insulin) or metabolic changes. RlMAbl markedly decreased hepatic and serum lipids when injected into db/db mice at day 7 post single injection, presumably due to lipid repartitioning effects through adipose tissues (Fig. 3B-D). RlMAbl injection did not induce phosphorylation of ΜΕΚ or ERK in lung and prostate (Fig. 3 A), two cancer-prone tissue types that express FGFR1. These observations together suggest that adipose tissues, but not the liver, are central for the common metabolic activity of RIMAb and FGF21. To further investigate this point, we used lipoatrophic ap2-srebplc transgenic mice, which display severe insulin resistance, leptin deficiency, and hepatomegaly, due to the lack of white adipose tissues and compromised brown adipose function (Fig 3Ε, 11) (Shimomura et al., Genes Dev. 12:3182-94 (1998); Shimomura et al., Nature 401:73-76 (1999)). Consistent with the idea that normal adipose tissue function is required for the metabolic activity of RlMAbl, a single i.p. injection at lmpk improved HOMA-IR and glucose tolerance only in the control ob/ob mice but not in ap2-srebplc mice (Fig. 3Ε). Food intake was reduced by RlMAbl injection in both ob/ob mice and ap2-srebplc transgenic mice, when compared to pair-fed mice injected with control IgG (Fig. 3Ε). In addition, continuous infusion of recombinant FGF21 also failed to improve insulin tolerance in ap2-srebplc mice, although significant increase in serum P-hydroxybutyrate (i.e. ketone body) and decrease in cholesterol were observed (Fig. 3F). Example 4, PGCl-alpha activation in brown adipose by RIMAb. FGF21 has recently been suggested to activate the nuclear receptor transcriptional coactivator PGC-la protein in adipose tissues and the liver to induce expression of the downstream genes associated with oxidative metabolism (Chau et al., Proc. Nat’l. Acad. Sci. USA 107:12553-58 (2010); Hondares et al., Cell Metabolism 11:206-12 (2010); Potthoff et al. Proc. Nat’l. Acad. Sci. USA 30; 106(26): 10853-8 (2009)). Indeed, when injected into ob/ob mice, RlMAbl significantly increased BAT expression of genes involved in OXPHOS, and fatty acid metabolism as revealed by DNA microarray analysis followed by a gene-set enrichment analysis (Fig. 4Α). RlMAbl (and FGF21) also increased expression of PGC-la, PGC-1 β, and their major targets CIDEA and UCP1 in brown adipose tissues (measured by qPCR; Figs. 4Β and 16). Transcription of PGC-la is regulated through cAMP Response Elements (CREs) in the promoter region and the CREB transcription factor that binds to the CREs (Herzig et al., Nature 413:179-83 (2001); Karamitri et al., J. Biol. Chem. 284:20738-52 (2009); Muraoka et al,,Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metah. 296:Ε1430-39 (2009); Shi et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2005)). In a screen to identify metabolism-related transcription factors that can be activated by FGF21 in ΗΕΚ293 cells expressing KLB, we found that GAL-CREB fusion protein can be activated by FGF21 (Fig. S8A-B). Subsequently, we found that both FGF21 and RlMAbl can activate GAL-CREB reporter as well as CRE-luciferase reporter in a dose dependent fashion in ΗΕΚ293 cells (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the idea that CREB functions as a downstream effector, FGF21 increased the phosphorylation of CREB and p90RSK, an upstream CREB kinase regulated by ERK, in mouse white adipose tissues (Fig. 4D), differentiated human primary adipocyte (Fig. 4Ε), and ΗΕΚ293 cells (Fig. 12C). Thus, CREB activation by FGF21 and RIMAb likely contributes to induction of PGC-lalpha and a set of downstream genes involved in oxidative metabolism in adipose tissues (Fig. 4F and 12D). In addition to transcriptional regulation suggested here, FGF21 has been reported to activate PGC-la post-translationally via activation of ΑΜΡΚ (Chau et al., supra), although we failed to observe evidence of ΑΜΡΚ activation in vitro or in vivo by RIMAb (data not shown). Collectively, our results support the role of PGC-la in adipose tissues in mediating the anti-lipid and anti-diabetic effects of FGF21 and RIMAb. Example 5, Testing bispecific anti-FGFR1/anti-beta-Klotho antibodies Another important difference between our RIMAbs and FGF21 is target receptor specificity. FGF21 can act on FGFRlc, 2c, and 3c, but its effects are likely limited to KLB expressing tissues (i.e. liver, adipose, and pancreas) (Fon Tacer et al., supra; Kurosu et al., J. Biol. Chem. 282:26687-95 (2007); Ogawa et al., Proc. Nat’l. Acad. Sci. USA 104:7432-37 (2007)). In contrast, the target tissues of our RIMAbs are determined by the expression of FGFR1 and tissue distribution of the antibody molecule, but unlikely limited by KLB expression. Indeed, we observed mild hypophosphatemia in mice treated with RlMAbl, suggesting the activation of FGF23/Klotho-pathway in the kidney. Accordingly, we generated bispecific anti-KLB/FGFRl bispecific antibodies using phage display or hybridoma technology (BALBc mice immunized with ΗΕΚ293 cells expressing FGFRlc and KLB) to generate separate anti-KLB antibodies and knob-and-hole technology (Merchant et al. Nature Biotechnol. 16(7): 677-81 (1998)). We tested the ability of these bispecific antibodies to activate GAL-Elkl expression and confirmed that these antibodies depend on the presence of both beta-Klotho and FGFR1 for downstream signal activation. We also confirmed that one of the antibodies could increase phosphorylation of downstream signaling intermediates, ΜΕΚ and ERK '/2 in differentiated primary human adipocytes. One of the bispecific antibodies cross reacts with the murine proteins and we used this antibody to test the in vivo activity of a bispecific antibody. We observed that this bispecific antibody reduced blood glucose levels without elevating serum FGF23, whereas the corresponding control anti-FGFRl (monospecific) antibody reduced blood glucose levels to a similar extent but significantly elevated serum FGF23 levels. Next we test the ability of these bispecific antibodies to provide the metabolic benefits of the anti-FGFRl agonistic antibodies. We generate transgenic mice expressing human beta-Klotho (the RlMAbl and RlMAb2 each recognize murine FGFR1) and confirm that the anti-KLB/FGFRl bispecific antibodies described above improve glucose tolerance in mouse models, e.g. high-fat diet fed hKLB transgenic mice. We also generate anti-beta-Klotho antibodies that react with the protein in other model animals (e.g. rat, rabbit, cynomologous and rhesus monkeys) and similarly test the ability of bispecific antibodies constructed with these and the anti-FGFRl antibodies to provide metabolic benefits.
