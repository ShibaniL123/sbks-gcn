FIELD The present disclosure relates to fire suppression systems, and more specifically, to flow control systems for fire suppression system that control the flow of a fire suppression agent as a function of temperature and pressure. BACKGROUND Fire suppression systems generally comprise a high rate discharge ("HRD") fire suppression agent system and a low rate discharge ("LRD") fire suppression agent system. Typically, LRD systems may generally be configured to deploy and/or discharge a fire suppression agent at a constant mass flow rate. In typically systems, the mass flow rate may remain constant to provide a minimum concentration of fire suppression agent at undesirable operating conditions. In this regard, typical systems may not consider actual ambient parameters such as ambient pressure and temperature during aircraft operation. SUMMARY In various embodiments, a fire suppression system may comprise a high rate discharge system and a low rate discharge system. The high rate discharge system may be configured to discharge a first portion of fire suppression agent to an aircraft structure. The low rate discharge system may be configured to discharge a second portion of fire suppression agent to the aircraft structure. The low rate discharge system may comprise a valve and an orifice. The valve may be configured to sense an ambient pressure of the aircraft structure. The orifice may be configured to receive a mass flow of fire suppression agent via the valve. In various embodiments, an LRD system may comprise a bottle and a poppet valve. The bottle may be configured to hold a pressurized fire suppression agent. The poppet valve may be in fluid communication with the bottle. The poppet valve may be configured to regulate a flow of fire suppression agent from the bottle in response to the LRD system being activated. The poppet valve may also be configured to regulate the flow of fire suppression agent as a function of ambient temperature and ambient pressure. The forgoing features and elements may be combined in various combinations without exclusivity, unless expressly indicated herein otherwise. These features and elements as well as the operation of the disclosed embodiments will become more apparent in light of the following description and accompanying drawings.

In various embodiments and with reference to FIG. 1, a fire suppression system 110 may be configured to discharge a fire suppression agent (e.g., a inert gases and/or chemical agents used to extinguish fire such as, for example, HALON®) into an aircraft structure 120. Fire suppression system 110 may consist of an HRD system 140 and an LRD system 130. HRD system 140 may comprise a bottle 142 (e.g., a pressure vessel) configured to store and/or hold a fire suppression agent. HRD system 140 may also comprise an exhaust device 144 (e.g., a flow regulating device, an orifice, a nozzle, a diffuser, and/or the like). Flow regulating device 144 may be configured to direct the discharge of a fire suppression agent deployed from bottle 142 in response to activation of HRD system 140. In various embodiments, LRD system 130 may comprise a pressure vessel and/or bottle 150, an actuation mechanism 155, a valve 160, and an orifice 170. Bottle 150 may be configured to deploy and/or contain fire suppression agent (e.g., Halon). Actuation system 155 may be configured to contain and/or restrain the fire suppressant agent in bottle 150. Actuation system 155 may be any suitable actuation system including for example an explosive device and/or any other suitable actuation system. Moreover, actuation system 155 may create a hermetic seal that is configured to minimize and/or eliminate leakage of the fire suppressant agent contained in bottle 150. Valve 160 may be configured to receive fire suppression agent flow and regulate the flow rate, pressure, and/or other attributes of the fire suppression agent being discharged from bottle 150. Moreover, valve 160 may be configured to conduct fire suppression agent from bottle 150 to orifice 170 at a predetermined condition. This predetermined condition may vary based on atmospheric conditions such as temperature and pressure in the aircraft structure and/or exerted on LRD system 130. In various embodiments, HRD system 140 may be configured to provide an initial knock down of a fire. In this regard, HRD portion 140 may be configured to initially mitigate, minimize, and/or limit the propagation of fire in an aircraft structure 120. LRD portion 130 may be configured to provide an extended duration of flow of fire suppression agent to maintain an agent concentration level in aircraft structure 120 that is sufficient to mitigate fire restart and/or fire propagation and compensate for the effects of airflow ventilation, leakage and/or the like that may reduce agent concentration levels in aircraft structure 120. FAA regulations may call for an LRD system to maintain volumetric fire suppression agent concentrations of at least 3% or greater (e.g., a concentration of fire suppression agent in compartment volume) In various embodiments and with reference to FIG. 2, valve 260 may be a poppet style valve. Valve 260 may comprise of bellows 262, a poppet 264, and a poppet seat 266. Valve 260 may further comprise and/or define a pressure chamber 265. Pressure chamber 265 may be configured to receive a flow suppression agent HI from the LRD system. Flow HI may be conducted into pressure chamber 265 causing the pressure in pressure chamber 265 to increase creating a force on bellows 262 causing movement of poppet 264 to close onto poppet seat 266. Low downstream pressure in the direction of HO acts upon poppet 264 to move the poppet 264 away from poppet seat 266. In this regard, HI may be configured to flow around poppet 264, past poppet seat 266 and downstream in the LRD system as flow HO to an orifice or other suitable flow control device. In various embodiments, bellows 262 may be subjected to an ambient pressure on an outer surface of the bellows (e.g., ambient pressure = PA). Moreover, an interior surface of bellows 262 may be subjected to a fire suppression agent pressure PH upstream of any metering orifice and/or device. As ambient pressure PA increases, bellows 262 may be compressed allowing poppet 264 to actuate open. In this regard, poppet 264 may move away from or translate away from poppet seat 266. In various embodiments and with reference to FIG. 1, fire suppression system 110 may be further coupled to and/or be in electronic communication with a controller 180. Controller 180 may be configured to monitor the mass flow rate and atmospheric conditions of LRD system 130 and/or aircraft structure 120. In this regard, controller 180 may monitor the flow through valve 160 and/or orifice 170. Moreover, controller 180 may monitor the temperature and pressure at valve 160, orifice 170, and/or aircraft structure 120. Controller 180 may comprise a memory and a processor. Moreover, controller 180 may be configured to store and execute any suitable software and/or computer executable instructions. In various embodiments, in order to achieve a concentration level of 3% or more of fire suppression agent, the mass flow rate of the fire suppression agent may need to vary. In this regard changes in air density, and/or bay pressure and temperature of aircraft structure 120 may require that different mass flow rates are needed to achieve at least a 3% fire suppression agent concentration. Concentration of a fire suppression agent may be defined by: R=0.01C×ES, where: R = the mass flow rate of fire suppression agent (e.g., pounds per minute)C = agent volumetric concentration in percent by volumeE = bay ventilation rate or leakage rate (e.g., volume per minute) S = specific volume of fire suppression agent vapor (e.g., volume per mass) In various embodiments, specific volume S of fire suppression agent HI or HO can vary based on both temperature and pressure, for example, specific volume may increase as temperature increases. Specific volume may also increase as ambient pressure decreases. As such, as specific volume increases the mass flow rate required to sustain a 3% concentration of fire suppression agent may decrease. In this regard, conditions such as high temperature and low compartment pressure of aircraft structure 120 (e.g., when aircraft structure 120 is at high altitude) may require less mass flow from LRD system 130 than when aircraft structure 120 is at a relatively low temperature and/or high compartment pressure. In various embodiments and with reference to FIGs. 1 and 2, with proper sizing of orifice 170 located downstream of valve 160/260, it may be possible to increase the internal pressure PH acting on bellows 262. At high temperature, compressed liquefied gaseous agents have higher pressure, and as a result, at higher temperature there will be a higher internal pressure PH acting inside the bellows causing bellows 262 to further close poppet 264 against poppet seat 266. This configuration may lower the fire suppression agent flow rate. At low temperature, the fire suppression agent may be at a lower pressure and bellows 262 may open poppet 264 (e.g., translate poppet 264 away from poppet seat 266) resulting in a higher flow rate HO. Restricting the size and/or flow area of orifice 170 may provide an increased flow rate HO at cold temperatures, and decreased flow rate HO at high temperatures. The fire extinguishing systems described herein may be deployed in any suitable aircraft structure. For example, the fire extinguishing systems described herein may be deployed and/or used in cargo bays, and other aircraft structures, as part of any suitable fire protection system in an aircraft, structure, and/or vehicle.
