WATER TREATMENT APPARATUS Technical Field [0001] The invention relates to an apparatus for treatment of mains water supply for a property at an entrance to the property so that the apparatus treats all incoming water to the property. [0002] Particularly, but not exclusively, the apparatus of the invention provides a means to reduce microorganism contamination, such as Legionella spp., and biofilm formation in water supplied from a public utility to provide potable water to all plumbed outlets on the property which is safe for consumption and food preparation. Background of Invention [0003] Infectious diseases which result from the consumption of contaminated water are a significant source of mortality and morbidity throughout the world. The majority of the population in developed countries, such as Australia, are provided with potable water supplied to their residential properties via public utilities. [0004] Typically, the public utilities provide water to a supply point at a property (e.g. the water main) which is plumbed into the property via a mains water meter at the entrance to the property. This supply of water is generally termed “mains water”, and provides the property with water for both consumption as well as other uses such showering, flushing toilets, watering gardens etc. Whilst the mains water supply is regulated, tested and maintained in order to ensure safety and a reliable supply, there is, on occasion, a need or desire to further treat the water at the property. [0005] Examples of existing on-site water treatment systems include those that are directed to treating drinking water at the point-of-use. These systems, for instance, typically use one or more filters to remove chemical and mineral contaminants from mains supplied water to say improve the taste of water for consumption. Filters appropriate for this use include: activated carbon filters (also known as granular-activated carbon filters), microporous ceramic filters, and resin filters. In addition, these systems may also utilise a reverse osmosis (RO) system to remove further impurities such as contaminating ionic salts from the water. These existing exemplary RO systems work by providing water to be filtered under pressure to a thin film composite membrane which includes a layer having a pore size of 200ηΐτΐ or less. These filters, however, are required to be located at each point-of-use of the water supply which can add considerable expense to the water supply installation. Summary of Invention [0006] Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention provides an apparatus for treatment of mains water supply for a property, the apparatus including: a water inlet for receiving water from the mains water supply; a water outlet for outputting water from the apparatus; a water flow path defined between the water inlet and the water outlet; a filtration system for removing contaminants from the water in the water flow path; and a dosing system for providing a biocide to the water in the water flow path, wherein the water inlet is adapted to be connected to the mains water supply at an entrance to the property so that the apparatus treats all incoming water to the property. [0007] Preferably, the apparatus is located at the entrance to the property after the incoming water main and associated water meter so as to provide filtration and chemical treatment of the water at the water mains of the property. Accordingly, the apparatus can reduce say microorganism contamination (e.g. bacterial pathogens and biofilm contamination) which may be present in mains supplied water for all the water outlets of the property. [0008] In an embodiment, the apparatus further includes a backflow prevention device for preventing the water dosed with the biocide in the water flow path from flowing back to the mains water supply connected to the water inlet. The backflow prevention device permits the apparatus to be connected to the mains water supply without the risk of contaminating the supply with the provided biocide. This is particularly important in some applications such as when the apparatus is connected to a shared water supply such as a common water main. Under AS3500 of the Australian plumbing standards, any device which provides or injects chemicals into a water pipeline which is connected to the mains water supply is required to be isolated from the mains water supply via such a back flow prevention device. In the embodiment, the backflow prevention device is a valve that acts to prevent water that has been provided with the biocide from flowing back to the water supply connected to the water inlet, thereby allowing the apparatus to be connected to the mains water supply. [0009] The backflow prevention device of the apparatus can be positioned at any suitable point in the water flow path that prevents backflow of water containing biocide back to the mains water supply. In some embodiments of the invention, the backflow prevention device is positioned in the flow path after the water inlet and before the dosing system. Alternatively, the backflow prevention device is positioned in the flow path after the water inlet and before the filtration system and the water dosing system. In some further embodiments of the invention, the water inlet is provided by the backflow prevention device. [0010] In another embodiment, the apparatus further includes a pressure limiting device for limiting pressure of the water outputted from the water outlet to, or below, a designated pressure. The pressure limiting device performs two roles. The first, and primary, role of the pressure limiting device is to keep the water pressure at the outlet of the apparatus at or below a desired level. For example, the pressure limiting device keeps the water pressure at or below 500kpa. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that the majority of tapware and related fittings are warrantied in Australia to 500kpa (AS/NZS 3500.1 - incorporated herein by reference) states that the maximum water pressure within buildings not to exceed 500kpa. Therefore, in some embodiments the pressure limiting device limits the pressure of the water outputted from the water outlet of the apparatus to, or below, 500kpa. A second role of the pressure limiting device is to limit the water pressure in the flow path to below a designated level thereby limiting the pressure within the filtration system and the dosing system such that these systems are not over-pressurized, and potentially damaged. With specific regard to the filtration system, for instance, preventing over-pressuring of the filter will protect against damage to the filter or filter membrane. Consequently, in this case, the pressure limiting device limits the pressure prior to the filtration system. [0011] As above, the water inlet of the apparatus is adapted to be connected to the mains-water supply of the property so that the apparatus treats all the incoming water to the property. For example, the apparatus is adapted to be plumbed into a pipeline connecting the water main of the property to the plumbing network of a building or residence of the property so that the apparatus treats all incoming water to the property/residence before it diverges into separate water lines. That is, the apparatus is adapted to be plumbed into the pipeline on the property side of the mains-water meter. The backflow prevention device and the pressure limiting device thus improve the apparatus’s capability to be a mains-water-connected whole-ofproperty water treatment apparatus. The backflow prevention device prevents contamination of the mains-water supply with biocide provided by the apparatus and the pressure limiting device allows the apparatus to be connected to the plumbing of the property without the risk of over pressurization of the property’s plumbing and tapware. [0012] In an embodiment, the filtration system removes contaminants larger than, or equal to, 5 microns in size from the water in the water flow path. Thus, the apparatus treats water flowing via the water flow path in two ways. Firstly, the water is filtered to remove contaminants that are larger or equal to 5 microns (pm) in size, and secondly the apparatus provides a biocide to the water. Preferably, the dosing system is positioned after the filtration system along the water flow path so that larger sized contaminants are removed and the biocide is only applied to the remaining smaller sized contaminants. When the water treatment is performed in this order the biocide only kills microorganisms that pass through the filter, being microorganisms smaller than 5 microns. Furthermore, by providing the biocide to the water after filtration, the filter or filter membrane is not exposed to high levels of the biocide which, depending on the biocide used and the type of filter used, may damage the filter or filtration membrane. [0013] It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that water filters can be used to remove contaminants larger than or equal to 5 microns from a water supply and typically these filters are termed “microfilters” (as opposed to “ultrafilters” and “nanofilters”). These microfilters generally utilise a membrane with a predetermined pore size to remove contaminants from a flowing liquid. The pore size of the filtration system of the apparatus - that is, a pore size capable of removing microorganisms equal to, or greater than, 5 microns in size - permits the necessary water flow and pressure required to allow the apparatus to filter all incoming water to a property without significantly reducing the water flow of the water supply to the property. It will also be appreciated that other sized filters are envisaged that say remove more smaller contaminants when water flow is not as important to residents of the property, e.g. 1 micron. [0014] It will also be appreciated that the term “contaminant” may relate to any physical debris or impurity in the water in addition to microorganism contaminants such as bacteria, protozoa, algae, fungi and biofilms. [0015] In an embodiment, the biocide is Chlorine, which is added to the water by the dosing system to chemically sterilize the water and reduce the load of microorganisms in the water passing through the water flow path in the apparatus. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that appropriate biocides are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, Chlorine, Chlorine Dioxide, Chloroisocyanurates, Hypochlorite and Ozone, as well as any biocide that is safe and approved for consumption. Indeed, biocides, such as Chlorine, are approved for use in water for consumption only below specific concentrations. The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines state that the concentration of Chlorine in a drinking source should be no more than 5 mg/L (or 0.0005% w/v). [0016] Consequently, in an embodiment, the dosing system of the present invention calculates the quantity of biocide to add to the water based on the water flow passing through the flow path of the apparatus. In order to provide the appropriate amount of biocide to the water, the dosing system of this embodiment includes a water meter (such as a magnetic pulse rated water meter) capable of reading the flow of water through the water flow path of the apparatus. The dosing system then calculates an appropriate dose of biocide to provide to the water based on a desired final concentration (or concentration range) of the biocide in the water being outputted from the apparatus and the volume of water passing through the water flow path as determined by the water meter. Consequently, in an embodiment, the dosing system of the water treatment apparatus also includes a water meter for calculating the volume of water passing through the dosing system thereby further permitting the calculation of the amount of biocide to be provided to the water. Once the appropriate amount of biocide to be provided to the water has been calculated, a dosing unit within the dosing system pumps the calculated dose of the biocide from a biocide reservoir into the water flow path by way of an injection needle. Resultantly, the water emerging from the water outlet of the apparatus has a desired concentration of biocide (or a concentration of biocide within a desired range). Consequently, in an embodiment, the dosing system injects biocide into water from a dosing unit via an injection needle. [0017] The dosing system of the apparatus described above requires a supply of electricity to allow for the metering of the volume of water flowing through the water flow path, the calculation of the biocide needed to be added to the water in the water flow path, and the operation of the dosing unit to provide the calculated dose of biocide. Electricity can be provided to the dosing system via any appropriate means known in the art. The system may be “hard wired” into a central electricity supply of the property. Alternatively, the apparatus includes its own source of electricity such that it can operate as a remote, stand alone, apparatus. In an embodiment, the water treatment apparatus includes an electricity supply including a solar panel for powering the dosing system. In a further embodiment, the apparatus also includes a battery for storing the generated electricity, and an inverter for converting the 12V DC electricity generated by the solar panel into 240V AC power. Alternative means for providing power to the apparatus includes a hydroelectric generator which is powered by pressurized water within, or entering, the apparatus. [0018] A second aspect the present invention provides a method of suppling treated water, the method including providing a water supply from the mains water supply of a property, limiting the pressure of the water supplied water to 500kpa or below, preventing backflow of the biocide dosed water into the mains water supply and filtering the provided water to remove any contaminants greater than or equal to 5 microns in size, dosing the water with a biocide. In an embodiment of the second aspect of the invention the method includes reading the flow of the water prior to dosing the water with a biocide and calculating the dose of biocide needed to add to the to the water to achieve a desired concentration of biocide in the water.

[0022] Figure 3 is the reverse isometric view of the apparatus shown in Figure 2. [0023] Figure 4 is a top view of the apparatus shown in Figures 2 and 3. [0024] Figure 5 is an isometric view of a housing for the apparatus of Figures 2 to 4. [0025] Figure 6 is a side view of a solar power collection system for use with the apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. Detailed Description [0026] According to an embodiment of the present invention there is provided an apparatus (100) for the treatment of a mains water supply for a property, as shown Figure 1. The apparatus (100) includes a water inlet (shown as MAINS SUPPLY in Figure 1) for receiving water from the mains water supply, a water outlet (shown as TREATED WATER in Figure 1) for outputting water from the apparatus (100), and a water flow path (1) defined between the water inlet and the water outlet. The apparatus (100) also includes a filtration system (4) for removing contaminants from the water in the water flow path (1) and a dosing system (110) for providing a biocide to the water in the water flow path (1). In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, the water inlet is adapted to be connected to the mains water supply, which is located at an entrance to the property, so that the apparatus (100) treats all the incoming water to the property and all the outlets for water in the property provide treated water to residents and users of the property. [0027] Water is provided from the mains-water supply of the property along the water flow path (1 - GREY ARROW) via the inlet. The apparatus (100) of Figure 1 also includes a backflow prevention device (2), which is provided to prevent the flow of water from the apparatus (100) back to the water supply. As above, the backflow prevention device (2) is a valve and can be positioned at any appropriate position in the water flow path (1) such that it prevents water dosed with biocide from flowing back into the water supply. In the illustrated embodiment shown in the Figures, the backflow prevention device (2) is positioned prior to the filtration system (4) and the biocide dosing system (110). It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that other suitable backflow prevention devices include a Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) device (also known as a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device), reduced pressure zone assemblies (RPZA) or reduced pressure principle assembly (RPPA). These devices are suitable for use in medium to high hazard applications whereby backflow of water into a water supply could or would cause significant harm. The inclusion of such a device on the apparatus (100) allows it to be directly connected to the mains water supply of a property. [0028] Subsequent to the backflow prevention device (2), the water in the water path (1) passes through a pressure limiting device (3). The pressure limiting device (3) acts to keep the pressure of the apparatus (100) below a desired level. In the embodiment, the pressure limiting device (3) is positioned prior to the filtration system (4) and the dosing system (110). As above, the pressure limiting device (3) protects the components of apparatus (100) - including the filtration system (4) and the dosing system (110) - from over pressurization. Further, the pressure limiting device (3) restricts the pressure of the water outputted from the apparatus (100) to below a desired level and thereby protects any plumbing which is connected to the apparatus. In the case of a domestic residence, the majority of tapware fitted to the residence is pressure rated (and provided with a warranty) up to 500kpa. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pressure limiting device (3) maintains the water pressure at, or below, 500kpa. [0029] Water in the water flow path (1) then passes though the filtration system (4) which, in one embodiment, selectively removes contaminants equal to or greater than 5 microns in size. Filtration is achieved by the use of a size exclusion filter (such as a microfilter), which preferably has a membrane provided with a series of pores of a predetermined size. The selection of filter, adapted for the removal of contaminants at or below 5 microns in size, permits the removal of a portion of the physical contaminant from the water in the water flow path (1) without reducing the flow rate of the water through the apparatus (100) to an undesired level. It will be appreciated that, as the pore size of the filter decreases, so does the flow rate of the water through the apparatus. [0030] Filtered water then passes through a dosing system (110) which provides a biocide to the water. In the embodiment of Figure 1, the dosing system (110) includes a water meter (5), a dosing unit (6) and an injection needle (7) which in combination provide the water in the water flow path (1) with a calculated dose of biocide so as to achieve a desired concentration of biocide in water outputted from the apparatus (100). The water meter (5) reads the flow of water through the flow path (1) and sends a signal (8) to a biocide dosing unit (6). The dosing unit (6) then calculates the required dose of the biocide to be added to the water in the water flow path to achieve a desired concentration of biocide in the treated water emanating from the apparatus. Once the required dosage of the biocide is calculated, the dosing unit (6) provides the biocide from a reservoir to the water via an injection needle (7) which sits within the water flow path (1). In a preferred embodiment the dosing unit include a digital dosing pump which administers a controlled flow of biocide into the water flow path via the injection needle (7). [0031] The dosing system (110) of the embodiment shown in Figure 1 requires the provision of electricity to read, calculate and provide the required dose of biocide to the water flow path (1). As illustrated in Figure 1, electrical power is provided by a solar power system. The solar power system here includes a photovoltaic solar panel (9), a battery (10) and a DC to AC invertor (11). The solar panel (9) generates electricity during day light and stores the power in the battery (10). The dosing system then draws down the electricity from the battery, when needed, via the invertor which converts the stored DC electricity into 240V AC electricity which powers the dosing system. [0032] Figures 2 and 3 provide opposing isometric views of an assembled embodiment of the apparatus (100) of the present invention. Figure 4 illustrates a top view of the assembled embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention. [0033] According to the embodiment illustrated in Figures 2, 3 and 4 there is shown a frame (21) for supporting the components of the apparatus (100) of the present invention. Water is supplied to a water flow path of the apparatus (100) via a mains-water supply (not shown). In the illustrated embodiment, water supply is plumbed into the apparatus via a water inlet (22) provided by a ball valve. The water inlet (22) can be turned off by closing the ball valve by moving the handle connected to the ball valve from a first open position to a second closed position, thereby isolating the water treatment apparatus (100) from the mains water supply. Water then passes through a strainer (23), which removes large particulate matter from the incoming water supply, prior to passing through a backflow prevention device (2). A further ball valve is provided (24) allowing isolation of the water flow after the backflow prevention device (2). A pressure limiting device (3) is subsequently provided in the water flow path prior to the water flow path diverging to supply two separate filters (4a and 4b) which provide the above mentioned filtration system. The number of filters installed (two of which are detailed in the illustrated embodiment) is determined to ensure sufficient water flow through the apparatus to permit the apparatus (100) to treat all incoming water to a property or residence. Ball valves are provided before (25a and 25b) and after (26a and 26b) each filters to allow for isolation of these filters. Each filter has a drain point (27a and 27b) provided with a ball valve allowing draining and flushing of the filters. After filtration the water flow path reconverges and passes through a water meter (5) which analyses the volume of water passing through the apparatus. This water meter (5) is wired (not shown) into the dosing unit (6) which provides a calculated dose of biocide into the water flow path via an injection needle (7). The water flow path then flows to a water outlet (31) which is plumbed into the central supply line of a property (28). [0034] Figure 5 illustrates a housing (51) for the apparatus of the present invention. The housing (51) isolates the apparatus (100) from the external environment whilst providing ventilation via integrated grills and access to the components of the apparatus via doors (52a and 52b). Such doors are located on each side of the housing (second side not shown) to permit servicing, monitoring and repair of the apparatus. The housing (51) for the apparatus (100) is mounted to the frame (21) of the apparatus which elevates the components of the apparatus (100) and the housing (51) off the ground, providing further protection from the external environment and increasing ventilation of the apparatus (100). The interior and exterior of the housing (51) is powder-coated which prevents rust and importantly provides chemical gas resistance, which is particularly important when chlorine is used as a biocide. The housing (51) is also provided with a solar system access door (53) to allow access to the battery and invertor which are internally mounted within the cabinet (not shown). [0035] The embodiment of the water treatment apparatus of the present invention as illustrated in Figures 2 to 5 is designed to be a fully transportable all-in-one system that can be quickly delivered and plumbed into a property or residence in the case of an emergency such as legionella infection of a mains water supply. [0036] Figure 6 illustrates a solar collection unit for installation outside of the housing for the apparatus (100). The solar collection unit includes a photovoltaic panel (61) mounted on a powder-coated pole (62). The solar collection unit can be mounted at a suitable location and connected to the components of the water treatment apparatus contained within the housing, thereby providing power for the dosing system (primarily the dosing unit). [0037] It is to be understood that various alterations, additions and/or modifications may be made to the parts specifically described without departing from the ambit of the present invention.
