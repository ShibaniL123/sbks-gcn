DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIGS. 1-12, a chair 1 can include a base 2 that supports a seat 3 and a backrest 4. The seat 3 and backrest 4 may each be moveable from an upright position to a reclined position via a tilt mechanism connected between the base and at least one of the seat and the backrest. The seat may include a seat frame and a seat skin attached to the seat frame. A pad or cushion may be supported by the seat frame and be covered by the seat skin. The backrest 4 can include a backrest frame that is attached to a back skin. A cushion may be positioned so that the back skin covers at least a portion of the cushion. The seat 3 may include a seat slide that is attached to a seat frame to permit the seat to slide forwardly and rearwardly relative to the backrest. The seat frame may be directly attached to the base 2. The backrest may be directly attached to the seat 3, the base 2 or both the seat 3 and the base 2. The frame of the backrest 4 may include a lower portion that is attached to a tilt mechanism coupled to the base or the seat frame, for example. Only the seat 3, only the backrest 4, or both the seat and backrest may be pivotally coupled to the base or may be resiliently coupled to the base 2 for movement relative to the base so that the seat 3 and backrest 4 are moveable from an upright position to a reclined position. The seat and backrest may also be pivotally coupled to each other or may be resiliently coupled to each other such that the seat and backrest are moveable synchronously from an upright position to a reclined position and vice versa. The seat 3 may additionally be moveable relative to the backrest 4 independent of the backrest 4 via a seat slide or other mechanism. The backrest 4 may also be configured to be moveable relative to the seat 3 independent of the seat 3. The base 2 of the chair may be a pedestal base that includes castors. A gas spring may be included in the base. The gas spring can be actuatable to adjust a height of the seat 3 and backrest 4. Alternatively, the base of the chair can include a non-height adjustable post or a plurality of legs that are attached to the seat 3 or frame of the seat 3 to support the seat 3 on a floor. Armrests 10 can be attached to the chair 1. The armrests 10 can be attached on opposite sides of the seat 3 or be attached to the base 2 such that arm pads 11 are positioned above the seat 3 adjacent opposite sides of the seat 3. Alternatively, the armrests 10 can be attached to a frame of the backrest 4. Posts 6 or other members may connect the armrests 10 to the base 2 of the chair, the seat frame of the chair, the seat of the chair, the backrest frame of the chair, or the backrest of the chair. The arm pads 11 of the armrest can be moveable to different vertical positions. It is also contemplated that the arm pads 11 can be configured for movement horizontally for slidable or rotatable motion of the arm pad. Each armrest may include a mechanism that can be attached to the arm pad to lock the position of the arm pad that is also adjustable to an unlocked position for permitting sliding movement of the arm pad to another position. The mechanism can alternatively be configured to have only one setting that is always on such that the horizontal position of the arm pad 11 is controlled by friction such that a user must provide a manual force that overcomes friction to slide the arm pad 11, rotate, and/or otherwise move the arm pad 11 to any one of a plurality of different positions. Each armrest 10 can include a plurality of components interconnected between the support post 6 and the arm pad 11 to permit the height of the arm pad 11 to be adjusted to any of a plurality of different vertical positions. A lock mechanism or actuation mechanism can be moved from a lock position to an unlock position to permit vertical adjustment of the arm pad 11 and also permit the vertical position of the arm pad 11 to be locked in place or maintained in place. The lock mechanism or actuation mechanism can be moved to the unlock position to permit the height of the arm pad 11 to be adjusted to a new position by a user providing an upward force on the arm pad 11 to raise the position of the arm pad 11 or controlling the downward motion of the arm pad 11 by providing a force on the arm pad to control how the arm pad 11 may drop in height due to gravity causing different components to allow the arm pad 11 to drop to a new lower position when the lock mechanism or actuation mechanism is moved to the unlocked position. When in that new position, the lock mechanism or the actuation mechanism can be moved to the locked position so that the arm pad 11 is not moveable to another vertical position unless the lock mechanism or actuation mechanism is subsequently returned to the unlocked position. Embodiments of the height adjustment mechanism that can be included in each armrest 10 can include a set of slidable members that can each move to be extendable and retractable from the support post 6 to provide vertical height adjustment of the arm pad 11. The group of interconnected components of the height adjustment mechanism can also include a rack 16 that is immovably affixed to the support post 6 within a central channel of the support post 6. The rack can include a plurality of steps that define a linear path of vertical travel for the arm pad 11 from a lowermost position to an uppermost position and also define positions between the lowermost and uppermost positions. The steps may be structured as teeth or other type of projection or protuberance that defines different positions for the arm pad as first and second slideable members 17 and 19 may move along those steps and be selectively positioned via use of any one of the steps defining the linear path of travel. A second slideable member 19 may be positioned for sliding motion within a first path along the rack 16 after a first slideable member 17 has been moved relative to the rack 16 along a first portion of the vertical path of travel defined by the rack 16. When moving along this first portion of the vertical path of travel defined by the rack 16, the first slideable member 17 can also move relative to the second slideable member 19 such that the first slideable member 17 moves vertically but the second slideable member stays in its same position and/or moves at a different extent of travel than the first slideable member 17. The second slideable member 19 can be configured such that upward movement of the second slideable member along a second portion of the vertical path defined by the rack 16 that may be located above the first portion of travel can also result in the first slideable member 17 moving with the second slideable member 19. A first slideable member 17 can be slideably positioned within a central channel 19a of the second slideable member 19. The first slideable member 17 can be partially slid out of the central opening 19a of the second slideable member to provide height extension of the arm pad 11. After the first slideable member 17 is moved to its furthest extent out of the central channel 19a, the first slideable member 17 may engage the second slideable member 19 such that further upward force acting on the first slideable member 17 causes the second slideable member 19 to move from adjacent a lowermost position within the support post adjacent the rack 16 to an uppermost position within the support post adjacent rack 16. A portion of the rack 16 can be configured as a blocking member 16b or the blocking member 16b can be otherwise attached to the rack 16 to contact with or otherwise engage an engagement member 25 attached to the second slideable member 19 to define the uppermost position of the second slideable member 19. The first and second slideable members 17 and 19 may slide vertically out of and into the post for extending and retracting from the post 6. The motion of the slideable members may be perfectly vertical or may be along a linear inclined path or a linear declined path such that the vertical motion of the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 each also includes a horizontal component of motion. It is also contemplated that some embodiments could be configured such that the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 are curved and move vertically along an arcuate path or a curved path. The arm pad 11 may be connected to the second slideable member 17 via an elongated adjustment member 18 to permit actuation of the height adjustment of the arm pad 11 by sliding the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 out of the post 6 for upwardly extending the position of the arm pad 11. The adjustment member 18 may also be actuated to permit a sliding motion of the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 so that these members retract back into the support post 6 such that the arm pad 11 can be moved to a vertically lower position. To lower the arm pad 11, the adjustment member 18 may be moved so that the second slideable member 19 may slide down or otherwise move downward within the channel 6a relative to the rack 16 to a lowermost position within the support post 6. Once the second slideable member 19 reaches its lowermost position within the support post 6, the first slideable member 17 may then be moveable from its uppermost position within a central channel 19a of the second slideable member 19 to its lowermost position within the central channel 19a such that the first slideable member 17 is moved to its lowermost position within the post 6. In some embodiments, the second slideable member 19 may move downward to its lowermost position within post 6 prior to the first slideable member 17 moving downward. In other embodiments it is contemplated that the first and second slideaable members may both be configured to move downwardly at the same time from their respective uppermost positions, or most extended positions, out of the post 6, to their lowermost positions, or most retracted positions, within the post 6. For instance, the actuation of the adjustment member 18 to release the locking of the positions of the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 could be configured to permit both members to slide downwardly due to gravity at the same time. Actuation of the height adjustment mechanism that permits vertical positioning of the arm pad 11 can be configured in numerous different ways. In some embodiments, the height adjustment mechanism of each armrest 10 can include an arm pad 11 that is attached to an arm pad support member 15. The arm pad 11 can include an opening formed in its bottom portion that is sized to receive a moveable actuator 13 and a spring member 12 that is configured to bias the actuator 13 to a locked position. The spring member may be a resilient member such as a leaf spring structure, an elastomeric member, or other spring element or resilient member that can bias the actuator 13 to its locked position. A user may be required to use a hand or one or more fingers to press the actuator 13 to act against the force of the spring member 12 biasing the actuator 13 to the locked position to unlock the height adjustment mechanism and permit height adjustment of the arm pad 11. A connection member 14 can be configured for attaching the spring member 12 to the actuator 13 together as well as attaching the actuator 13 and spring member 12 to the arm pad support member 15. The connection member 14 can be sized to help affix the spring member 12 and actuator to the arm pad support member 15 within the opening formed in the bottom portion of the arm pad 11. The connection member 14 can additionally or alternatively be configured to reduce wear that could be experienced by the arm pad support member 15 by being positioned between an internal surface of the arm pad support member and the spring member 12 and actuator 13 so that motion of the spring member 12 and actuator 13 can result in those elements contacting the connection member 14 instead of the surface of the arm pad support member 15. The actuator 13 can include a first end that is sized for extending out of an opening 15a formed in the arm pad support member 15 so that a portion of the actuator 13 can be contacted by a user to move the actuator 13 to actuate height adjustment. The actuator 13 may also have a second end opposite its first end that has protuberances 13b sized to be pivotally attached to the arm pad support member 15. Each protuberance 13b may have an end that is received within a hole 15c of the arm pad support member so that the actuator is pivotable about the ends of the protuberances 13b. Projections 12b of the spring member 12 can also be attached to the actuator 13 adjacent the protuberances 13b. The projections 12b can be spaced apart from one another by an aperture 12a defined by the spaced apart projections 12b and intermediate portion of the spring member from which those projections 12b extend. The aperture 12a is sized so that a space is provided between the projections 12b so that a centrally located downwardly extending connector 13a can extend from the second end of the actuator 13 and pass through the aperture 12a of the spring member 12, aperture 14a defined in the connection member 14 and aperture 15b defined in the arm pad support member 15 for connecting to the adjustment member 18. The downwardly extending connector 13a can be sized to be matingly interconnected to the adjustment member 18 by passing through an opening 18b formed in the upper end of the adjustment member 18. The connector 13a can be attachable to the adjustment member 18 such that pivotal motion of the actuator 13 results in the adjustment member 18 being rotated. The portion of the actuator 13 that extends out of opening 15a can be pressed by a user so that the first end of the actuator is moved upwardly into the arm pad support member 15 toward the arm pad 11. The second end of the actuator 13 will rotate downwardly in response to the upward motion of the first end of the actuator 13. The downward motion of the second end of the actuator 13 can drive rotation of the adjustment member 18 attached to the connector 13a from its first, locked position, to a second, unlocked position. When the user removes the force from the actuator, the spring member 12 can provide a force that acts on the actuator 13 to drive the first end of the actuator to extend further out of the opening 15a downwardly while also driving the second end of the actuator and the connector 13a upwardly to rotate the adjustment member 18 back to its locked position, or first position. The adjustment member 18 is attached to the first slidable member 17 that is slidably attached to the second slidable member 19 and is moveable within a central channel 6a of the support post 6. The second slidable member 19 is moveably positioned within the central channel 6a formed in the support post 6. The upper end of the adjustment member 18 is attached to the actuator 13 via upper opening 18b receiving the connector 13a for interlocking with the connector 13a. The lower end of the adjustment member 18 has an elongated slot 18a that is elongated linearly and is sized to moveably receive a portion of an interlocking member 24 for attaching the adjustment member 18 to the first slidable member 17 and second slidable member 19. The elongated slot 18a can be a horizontal slot or can be a slot that is angled so that the slot extends along a declined or inclined linear path that may have rounded ends where one end is at a more elevated position on the adjustment member 18 than the opposite end of the slot 18a. The slot 18a can be defined within the adjustment member 18 as an elongated opening such that the slot 18a can be an elongated rectangular shaped, polygonal shaped, or oval shaped aperture. The interlocking member 24 has a first connecting portion 24b that is on a first side of the interlocking member 24 that is opposite a second side of the interlocking member 24 to which a second connecting portion 24a extends. The first connecting portion 24b is sized to pass through a generally circular or polygonal shaped opening 17b in the first slidable member 17 that is sized to rotatably receive the first connecting portion 24b of the interlocking member. The second connecting portion 24a of the interlocking member 24 passes through an arcuate slot 17a that is formed in the first slidable member 17. The arcuate slot 17a is formed such that the slot 17a is elongated at an angle such that the slot 17a extends both vertically and horizontally from a lower end to an upper end. The slot 17a defines a curved path of travel for a portion of the second connecting portion 24a. The second connecting portion 24a passes through the slot 17a as well as the slot 18b of the adjustment member 18 for interconnecting the adjustment member 18 to the first slidable member 17. The adjustment member 18 is positioned on a first face of the first slideable member 17. The first slideable member 17 is positioned within the central channel 19a defined within the second slideable member 19. An intermediate portion 24c of the interlocking member 24 that is between the first and second connecting portions 24b and 24a is positioned within the opening 19b defined in the second slideable member 19b that is in communication with the central channel 19a for movement within the opening 19b as well as movement into and out of contact with and/or engagement with the steps 16a (e.g. teeth, spaced apart projections, etc.) on a side of the rack 16. The opening 19b of the second slideable member 19 is sized to receive steps 16a of the rack 16 that are on or otherwise attached to a first side of the rack 16 so that at least some of the steps 16a are extendable within the opening 19b for receiving and releaseably retaining the interlocking member 24 (e.g. the intermediate portion 24c of the interlocking member 24). When the armrest 10 is assembled and attached to the support post 6, the rack 16 can be immovably positioned in the channel 6a of the support post 6 and can be configured to have steps 16a that are sized to extend into the second opening 19b of the second slideable member 19 for releaseably receiving the intermediate portion 24c of the interlocking member that is configured to releaseable interlock with those steps (e.g. spaced apart linearly aligned teeth, projections, protuberances, etc.) 16a for positioning of the arm pad 11 at different height positions. The interlocking member 24 may be moved relative to the second slideable member 19 and the steps 16a of the rack 16 to adjust the vertical position of the arm pad 11. The interlocking member 24 can be moved out of engagement with a lower step to a higher position for engagement with an upper step of the rack 16. When the interlocking member 24 is moved to be positioned in an upper step, the first slideable member 17 may also be moved relative to the second slideable member 19 to further extend out of the post 6 to provide further height adjustment of the pad 11. The first slideable member 17 may be slid relative to the second slideable member 19 within the central channel 19a adjacent to the opening 19b of the second slideable member 19 that is in communication with the central channel 19a while the position of the interlocking member is moved from one step of the rack to another upper step of the rack. The upper end of the opening 19b can be defined by a portion of the second slideable member 19 and can also define the uppermost position of the first slideable member 17 within the channel 19a of the second slideable member 19 at which the greatest extent of the first slideable member 17 is extended out of the channel 19a of the second slideable member 19. A portion of the second slideable member 19 that defines the bottom of the central channel 19a can define the lowermost position of the first slideable member 17 within the central channel 19a, which can be a position in which the first slideable member 17 is fully retracted within the second slideable member 19 or is the least extended out of the channel 19a of the second slideable member 19. Movement of the actuator 13 can be configured to move the adjustment member 18 and rotate the interlocking member 24 to permit vertical sliding motion of both the first and second slideable members 17 and 19. For instance, when a user pushes or presses the first end portion of the actuator 13 upwardly into the arm pad support member 15 toward the arm pad 11, the second end of the actuator 13 moves downwardly from a locked position to an unlocked position. The adjustment member 18 attached to the second end of the actuator 13 via connector 13a is also moved downwardly due to the downward motion of the second end of the actuator 13. This downward motion of the adjustment member 18 is translated to the second connecting portion 24a of the interlocking member 24 by the portion of the adjustment member 18 that defines the slot 18a in which the second connecting portion 24a passes through. The downward motion of the second connecting portion 24a causes the interlocking member 24 to rotate about the first connecting portion 24b that is positioned within the generally circular or polygonal shaped opening 17b. The rotation of the interlocking member 24 about the first connecting portion 24b causes the intermediate portion 24c of the interlocking member 24 to move out of contact with the step of the rack 16 or out of engagement with the step of the rack 16 to which that portion 24c was previously engaged so that the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 are vertically moveable within the post 6 relative to the steps 16a of the rack 16 positioned within the post 6. After moving the actuator 13 to the unlocked position and maintaining the actuator 13 in the unlocked position, a user may pull up on the arm pad 11 to drive upward motion of the first and second slideable member 17 and 19 from a bottommost position of the arm pad 11 to an uppermost position of the arm pad 11. The first slideable member 17 may move vertically first relative to the second slideable member 19 within central channel 19a until the second connecting portion 24a of the interlocking member 24 is slid from its bottommost position within the central channel 19a and opening 19b to its uppermost position within the central channel 19a and opening 19b. When in the uppermost position within the central channel 19a, the intermediate portion 24c of the interlocking member 24 is in contact with or otherwise engages the portion of the second slideable member 19 that defines the top of the opening 19b. At this position, the interlocking member 24 may be prevented from further upward motion along the second slideable member 19. Thereafter, the upward force the user is applying to the arm pad 11 to move the arm pad 11 to a higher position is translated to the second slideable member 19 so that the second slideable member 19 along with the first slideable member 17 may move within the post 6 to an uppermost position adjacent the rack 16. The first slideable member 17 also moves with the second slideable member 19 due to the connection the second slideable member 19 has with the first slideable member 17 via the interlocking member 24 and the first connecting portion 24a of the interlocking member 24 being attached to the first slideable member 17 and contacting with or otherwise engaging the second slideable member 19 adjacent the top of the opening 19b. The second slideable member 19 and first slideable member 17 can both be moveable upwards relative to the rack as the interlocking member 24 is still out of engagement with any step of the steps 16a on a first side of the rack and the opening 19b is configured to receive the steps of the rack as the second slideable member 19 may move upwards relative to the rack 16. The engagement member 25 can be attached to the side of the second slideable member 19 opposite the side of the second slideable member 19 having opening 19b defined therein or can be attached to a side of the second slideable member 19 that is immediately adjacent to the side defining the opening 19b (e.g. a side that is to the left or right of the side having the opening 19b). The engagement member 25 can be attached to a side of the second slideable member 19 so that it is positioned adjacent to a lower portion of the second slideable member 19 to define the extent to which the second slideable member 19 is moveable vertically upwards within the channel 6a of the post 6 relative to the rack 16. The engagement member 25 can slide along the rack 16 adjacent aperture 16c at least partially defined by a second side of the rack that is opposite the first side of the rack having the steps 16a. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the aperture 16c can be defined in a side of the rack that is a different side than the side of the rack defining the steps 16a, but may not be the side that is opposite the side defining the steps 16a and/or otherwise having the steps 16a. The engagement member 25 can be slideable upwards until reaching a blocking member 16b attached to an upper end of the rack or integrally formed on the rack adjacent the side of the rack opposite the steps 16a. The blocking member 16b can be positioned and configured so that when the engagement member 25 contacts or otherwise engages the blocking member 16b, the second slideable member 19 is no longer able to move upwards for further extension out of the channel 6a of the post 6 such that an uppermost position of the arm pad 11 is defined by the engagement member 25 in cooperation with the blocking member 16, opening 19b and interlocking member 24 connected to the first slideable member 17. At this uppermost position, the interlocking member 24 may still be positioned at its uppermost position in the opening 19b. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the second and first slideable members 17 and 19 may be configured so that the interlocking member 24 may alternatively be positioned adjacent a lower portion of the opening 19b of the second slideable member 19 (e.g. at a bottommost position or other lower position in opening 19b) or may be positioned at another portion of the opening 19b that is below the uppermost position of the interlocking member 24 within the opening 19b (e.g. the upward movement of the second slideable member may result in the opening 19b being moved upwardly relative to the interlocking member 24 when the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 are both moving upwardly along the second portion of the path of travel defined by the rack 16). For such embodiments, the second slideable member 19 may have another element that is contactable with the steps 16a of the rack 16 below the location of the interlocking member 24 to facilitate such motion and still allow both the first and second slideable members 17, 19 to be affixed in their positions by the steps 16a of the rack when the actuator is moved to a locked position. It is contemplated that this additional element may be a configuration of the engagement member 25 or may be a second interlocking member connected to the actuator 13 that is moveable into and out of engagement with steps 16a via motion of the actuator 13 between its locked and unlocked positions. After having moved the arm pad 11 to the uppermost position, a user may depress the actuator 13. In response to the user's force being removed from the first end of the actuator 13, the spring member 12 acts on the actuator 13 to cause the actuator to move so that the first end of the actuator moves downwardly away from the arm pad 11 and the second end of the actuator 13 is rotated upwardly to the locked position. The upward motion of the second end of the actuator 13 driven by the spring member 12 causes the adjustment member 18 to move upwardly as well due to its connection to the connector 13a of the actuator 13. The upward motion of the adjustment member 18 driven by rotation of the actuator 13 to its locked position drives motion of the interlocking member 24 by driving rotation of the second connecting portion 24a about the pivot point defined by the first connecting portion 24b within opening 17b such that the second connecting portion 24a moves along slots 18a and 17a to its locked position along the arcuate path defined by the slot 17a. Rotation of the second connecting portion 24a also causes movement of the intermediate portion 24c of the interlocking member 24 into contact with and/or engagement with a step 16 of the rack adjacent the location of the interlocking member 24. The engagement of the interlocking member 24 with the step 16a of the rack locks the height of the arm pad 11 and prevents the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 from moving upwards or downwards while the actuator is in the locked position. When a user subsequently desires to reposition the arm pad 11 to a lower location, the user may again move the actuator 13 to move the actuator 13, adjustment member 18, and interlocking member 24 to their unlocked positions and maintain the actuator 13 in its unlocked position so that the interlocking member 24 is rotated out of engagement with the step 16a of the rack in which it was previously engaged such that the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 are moveable downwardly. The second slideable member 19 may move downwardly first within the channel of the post 6. During such downward motion of the second slideable member, the engagement member 25 may move along the aperture 16c of the rack from the uppermost position of the engagement member to a lowermost position of the engagement member 25. During this downward motion of the second slideable member 19, the interlocking member 24 may move within the opening 19b of the second slideable member from adjacent a bottom of the opening 19b to adjacent the top of the opening 19b. Also during such downward motion of the second slideable member 19, the first slideable member 17 may not move or may move with the second slideable member 19 at the same rate of speed or at a slower rate of speed. After reaching its bottommost position (and the bottommost position of the engagement member 25), the second slideable member 19 may contact or otherwise engage the interlocking member 24 adjacent the top of the opening 19b. To the extent further downward movement of the arm pad 11 is possible depending on the downward travel of the first and second slideable members 17 and 19, the weight of the first and second slideable members 17 and 19, arm pad 11 and other elements can drive further downward motion of the first slideable member 17 within the post 6 and the channel 19a to a lower position. Once the first slideable member 17 reaches its lowermost position within the channels 6a and 19a, the arm pad 11 may be at its lowermost position. A user may then stop pressing on the actuator 13 and the spring member 12 will bias the actuator back to its locked position such that the actuator 13, adjustment member 18, and interlocking member 24 are returned to a locked position. In this regard, the intermediate portion 24c of the interlocking member 24 is moved back into contact with or otherwise moved into engagement with a lowermost step of the rack 16 to lock the vertical position of the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 within the post 6. For vertical adjustments of the arm pad 11 where the second slideable member 19 is not required to extend from the post 6 or retract into the post 6, the vertical adjustment of the arm pad 11, the movement of the actuator 13 can permit the first slideable member 17 to move within the channel 19a relative to the rack 16 and second slideable member 19 to different vertical positions defined by the steps 16a of the rack 16. The extent of such vertical adjustment can be dependent on the vertical height or length of the opening 19b of the second slideable member 19. In some embodiments, actuator 13 may not be needed to actuate height adjustment. Instead, the steps 16a of the rack 13 can be configured to permit upward adjustment of the arm pad 11 and upward movement of the first and second slideable members while preventing the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 to move downwardly without an actuation of an actuator. For instance, the height adjustment mechanism can be configured so that a user may simply push up on the arm pad 11 to drive upward movement of the arm pad by the inclination and shape of the steps 16a permitting upward motion of the first and second slideable members and the interlocking member 24. An actuator may be attached to the arm pad and connected to the first and/or second slideable members 17 and 19 so that manipulation of the actuator by a user adjusts a position of the interlocking member 24 to permit the arm pad to be lowered. In yet other embodiments, both the raising and lowering of the arm pad 11 can be effected without use of an actuator 13. For such embodiments, that may not include actuator 13, the interlocking member 24 may not be configured for any type of rotational movement, the adjustment member 18 may not be included, the spring member 12 may not be included, the connection member 14 may not be included, and the arm pad support member 15 may be configured differently (e.g. not include opening 15a and/or aperture 15b). The engagement member 25 may also not be included in such an embodiment. For this type of embodiment, the height adjustment mechanism of the armrest 10 can be configured to permit a user to provide an upward force that causes the arm pad to move upwardly and the interlocking member 24 to be moved upwardly along the rack 13. When lowering of the arm pad is desired, the arm pad 11 can be configured to move upwardly to its uppermost position so that the interlocking member 24 is free of the rack and subsequently be slideable all the way to the bottom of the rack 13 before being replaced into engagement with the rack for locking a vertical position of the arm pad. For such an embodiment, lowering of the arm pad could be configured to require the arm pad to be moved beyond its uppermost position so that the interlocking member 24 is moved fully out of engagement with all the steps 16a of the rack and is free to subsequently be slid within the channel of the post 6 to a lowermost step 16a before becoming reengaged with the steps of the rack. The sizing of elements of the height adjustment mechanism may need to be configured to accommodate spacing within the post 6 for accommodating such movement. A cover member 20 can be attached to the arm pad support member 15 that includes a body defining an opening to receive and cover upper portions of the first and second slideable members 17 and 19 and an adjustment member 18 to avoid pinch points being exposed to a user. An expandable and retractable cover element 21 can also be connected between the post 6 and the arm pad 11 to hide such pinch points. For instance, the cover element 21 can be attached to the cover member 20 at its upper end and the post 6 at its bottom end so that the cover element 21 expands when the arm pad 11 is moved to a higher location and retracts when the arm pad is moved to a lower position to cover the moveable and extendable first and second slideable members 17 and 19 and adjustment member 18 so that openings and pinch points related to such elements are covered and not exposed for direct contact with a user, who could have a finger or other body part pinched between such elements when those elements move. The cover member 20 and cover element 21 can also function to protect other elements of the armrest 10 from dirt, grime, or other conditions that could cause damage to such components. It should be appreciated that embodiments of the armrest 10 can be configured differently. For instance, the shape and size of the adjustment member 18, first and second slideable members 17 and 19, arm pad 11, arm pad support member 15, spring member 12, actuator 13, rack 16, interlocking member 24 and engagement member 25 can each be any of a number of different shapes and sizes to meet different design criteria or design objectives. Each of these elements can be formed by only one structure or by multiple interconnected structures that are interconnected via any type of fastening mechanism or combination of such mechanisms. Bolts, screws, adhesives, or other fastening mechanisms can be used to help interconnect or attach different elements together as needed to meet different design criteria as well. As yet another example, the adjustment member 18, first and second slideable members 17 and 19, arm pad 11, arm pad support member 15, spring member 12, actuator 13, rack 16, interlocking member 24 and engagement member 25, cover member 20 and cover element 21 can each be composed of any type of material that can help meet a particular design objective such as a metal, an elastomeric material, a polymeric material, or be composed of a combination of such materials due to the interconnection of different structures formed of different types of materials to form that element.
