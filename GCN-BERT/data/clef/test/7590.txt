(4) Preparation of trimethylammonium (2S,5R)-2-((2-methyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl sulfate
(2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-N-(2-methyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1] octane-2-carboxamide (350 mg, 0.91 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture solvent of isopropanol and water (1:1, 15 mL), triethylamine (275 mg, 2.72 mmol) sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex (253 mg, 1.81 mmol) and Pd/C (80 mg) are added, the system was vacuumed and purged with nitrogen gas for 3 times, then purged with hydrogen gas, stirred at room temperature for 1.5h. Filtration was performed to remove catalyst, the filtrate was separated by high performance liquid chromatography to obtain the title compound as a white solid (100 mg, yield 25%).
