PRIORITY CLAIM This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/773,798, filed Mar. 6, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, as if fully set forth herein. BACKGROUND Alterations of epigenetic regulation are a characteristic of many diseases. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factor plays central roles in the transmission of extracellular signals to the genome and in the activation of the genetic programs that control cell differentiation, proliferation, morphogenesis, survival and apoptosis of a wide range of cell types (Potthoff et al., 2007). The spectrum of genes activated by MEF2 in different cell types depends on extracellular signaling and on cofactor interactions that modulate MEF2 activity. To drive the expression of MEF2 target genes, MEF2 relies on the recruitment of and cooperation with a number of transcription factors including, but not limited to, calcineurin binding protein 1, E1A binding protein P300, CREB binding protein, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5, myoblast differentiation protein, Smad protein, nuclear factor of activated T cell, myocardin, and positive transcription elongation factor b. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a major class of epigenetic regulators of diverse cellular processes. This family of enzymes can be phylogenetically divided into four classes: class I (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8), class II (HDAC4, 5, 7, 9, 6 and 10) and class IV (HDAC 11), while class III (sirtuins, Sirt1-Sirt7) represents a structurally and functionally distinct family of HDAC enzymes. Class II HDACs can be further divided into class IIa (HDAC 4, 5, 7, and 9) and class IIb (HDAC 6 and 10). Recent studies show that MEF2 forms an intimate partnership with class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACx), which together function as a point of convergence of multiple epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Class IIa HDACs contain a unique regulatory domain, which is N-terminal to the catalytic domain and absent in other HDAC members. This regulatory HDAC domain mediates interactions with the Myocyte Enhancer Factor-2 (MEF2A-D) transcription factor proteins. Class IIa HDACs do not bind to DNA but depend on their interaction with the sequence-specific transcription factor MEF2 for genomic targeting (Wang et al., 2001; Han et al., 2005). This interaction is mediated by a short amphipathic helix conserved in the N-terminal regulatory domain of class IIa HDACs. Crystallography analyses and in vitro biochemical studies reveal that the amphipathic helix binds to a highly conserved hydrophobic groove on the MADS-box/MEF2 domain of MEF2 (Han et al., 2005; Han et al., 2003).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1—An illustration of the mammalian two-hybrid system used for drug screening. The MEF2D (ovals) was fused with GAL4-DNA binding domain (half moons). The MEF2-binding motif of HDAC4 (amino acid residues 155-220, short rectangle) was fused with VP-16 (circle). When the GAL4-MEF2D and HDAC4-VP16 protein complex binds the DNA promoter site, expression of luciferase protein was induced in the HeLa cell as a reporter signal. FIG. 2—A graph depicting the normalized luciferase response when HeLa cells were co-transfected with the Gal4Luc reporter plasmid either alone or with the GAL4-MEF2D construct only, with the HDAC4-VP16 construct only, with the GAL4-MEF2D and HDAC4-VP16 constructs together (producing a reporter signal), or with the positive control GAL4VP16 construct (producing a stronger reporter signal). DETAILED DESCRIPTION Most of the currently known small molecule compounds that alter epigenetic regulations target the active site of the HDACs of class I, II, and IV (Bradner et. al., 2010). Class IIa HDAC proteins do not respond to most of these existing HDAC inhibitors (Bradner et. al., 2010). Moreover, the broad inhibition of HDACs using active site inhibitors leads to complex cellular responses, which may explain some of the undesired side effects of these drugs in clinical applications. Therefore, there is a need for developing small molecules that specifically target a particular HDAC or subset of HDACs to exploit the full therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibition in a wide range of diseases. Additionally, there is a need for developing small molecules that specifically target and inhibit class IIa HDACs that do not respond to existing HDAC inhibitors. Lastly, there is a need for developing small molecules that regulate MEF2 interactions as a new therapeutic target for treating diseases related to dysfunctional epigenetic regulation. I.

Example 8 Mammalian Two-Hybrid Assay Used to Determine the Inhibitory Effects of the Compounds on MEF2D and HDAC4 Protein Interactions Methods Detection of MEF2D and HDAC4 interactions. In this mammalian two-hybrid assay, HDAC4 and MEF2D proteins were used as representative members of their respective protein families because the protein-protein interactions involved in the recruitment of class IIa HDACs by MEF2 were highly conserved. Two separate DNA constructs were made with MEF2D fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-MEF2D) and with the MEF2-binding motif of HDAC4 (AA 155-220) fused with the viral transactivator VP-16 (HDAC4-VP16) (FIG. 1). Human epithelial carcinoma cells (HeLa) were co-transfected with the two DNA constructs (GAL4-MEF2D and HDAC4-VP16) and a reporter plasmid (Gal4Luc). The DNA constructs resulted in expression of the GAL4-MEF2D and HDAC4-VP16 fusion proteins within the cell. MEF2D and HDAC4 protein interactions were detected as a result of the GAL4-MEF2D and HDAC4-VP16 protein complex binding a DNA promoter on the reporter plasmid (Gal4Luc) and driving cellular expression of a luciferase gene (FIG. 1). The measured luciferase protein signal was proportional to the amount of MEF2D and HDAC4 protein interactions occurring with the cell. Co-expression of GAL4-MEF2 and HDAC4-VP16 DNA constructs produced a luciferase response comparable to that generated by the positive control GAL4-VP16 fusion (GAL4VP16) in HeLa cells (FIG. 2). The relatively stronger signal from the GAL4VP16 positive control construct was probably due to the fact that the activation domain of VP16 was covalently linked to GAL4, whereas in the mammalian two-hybrid assay it was recruited by protein-protein interactions between HDAC4 and MEF2 (FIG. 2). This assay permitted the detection of the interactions between HDAC4 and MEF2D with minimal interference from endogenous factors. The HDAC4 fragment lacked the catalytic domain so that the deacetylase activity was excluded from the assay. Detection of inhibition of MEF2D and HDAC4 interactions. Next, the assay was used to test whether the compounds could disrupt the interactions between MEF2D and HDAC4. After co-expressing the GAL4-MEF2D and HDAC4-VP16 DNA constructs and reporter plasmid, the HeLa cells were treated with a test compound (10 μM) overnight. Cells transfected with the positive control GAL4VP16 fusion construct and reporter plasmid were also treated with the test compound (10 μM) overnight. As another control, DMSO was added (but kept below 0.2% V/V) to cells transfected with the positive GAL4VP16 fusion construct or the GAL4-MEF2D and HDAC4-VP16 DNA constructs. A luciferase assay was performed as described above according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The luciferase response was normalized against the Renilla Luciferase as an internal control. The relative activity and IC50 calculations. The test compound, at a concentration of 10 μM, decreased the reporter signal driven by GAL4-MEF2D and HDAC4-VP16 protein complex by X fold, while the control solution, which was DMSO, also decreased the reporter signal by Y fold. The relative activity, I, was the ratio of former to later, i.e. X/Y, expressed in percentile. The relative activity for compounds showing the strongest inhibition was low compared with those compounds that showed little to no inhibition of MEF2D and HDAC4 interactions. The IC50 was the concentration of the compounds when X/Y equals 50. Results The compounds were categorized into Groups A-D. Compounds in Group A had a relative activity between 0 and 22 (Table 2). The relative activity of Group B compounds was between 22 and 50 (Table 2). Compounds in Group C and Group D had relative activities between 50 and 100 and above 100, respectively (Table 2). Group A compounds were the most effective inhibitors of MEF2D and HDAC4.

The assay results showed that the test compounds were able to inhibit MEF2 and HDAC4 interactions. The inhibition was not dependent upon the compound binding to the HDAC4 active site because the active site of the HDAC4 protein was not expressed in the assay. Unlike currently available HDAC inhibitors, the inhibitory results of the compounds in this specific assay demonstrated that they could specifically target and inhibit class IIa HDAC interactions with MEF2. The assay utilized a specific domain of HDAC4 (amino acids 155-220) that was unique only to class IIa HDACs. The significance of this result was that these compounds may be able to affect the development or progression of a disease by specifically regulating a specific class of HDACs (class IIa) without the adverse consequences of disrupting the essential functions of the entire HDAC protein family, such as HDACs in classes I, IIb, and IV. The following Example demonstrates the significant potential of these compounds in controlling disease with an assay that showed that they can inhibit the growth of leukemia cells. Example 9 Inhibition of Nalm-6 Leukemia Cell Growth Method Treatment of cells. Nalm-6 leukemia cells were grown to the logarithmic growth phase and seeded into 24-well plates. Plated cells were incubated at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 24 hours and treated with various concentrations of compounds. Treated cells were further incubated for 72 hours and then were examined for cell proliferation. Cell proliferation was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescence Cell Viability assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The calculated inhibition rate was determined with the following formula: Inhibition rate (%)=(1−Luminescence of experimental group/Luminescence of control group)×100. The 1050 was the calculated concentration of a compound needed to inhibit half of the maximum cell growth (equivalent to cell growth in control group) based on the corresponding dose-response curve under the described experimental conditions. Results Inhibition of the growth of the Nalm-6 leukemia cell line. Table 3 displays the survival percentage of Nalm-6 leukemia cells that were treated with the compounds. These data were consistent with the results observed in the two-hybrid assay presented in Example 8. All of the Group A compounds consistently showed strong growth inhibition of the Nalm-6 leukemia cells. The cell growth inhibition for compounds CC1 and CC4 were comparable to the results in the two-hybrid assay showing a mild inhibitory effect in both assays. Surprisingly, compound CC6 of Group C showed a strong growth inhibition response comparable to the Group A compounds. Since CC6 showed a weaker inhibition of interactions between HDAC4 and MEF2, the strong growth inhibition of leukemia cells by CC6 was likely a result of CC6 inhibition of MEF2 interactions with other transcription co-factors rather than class IIa HDACs.
