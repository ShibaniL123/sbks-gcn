1. A method for non-invasive assessment of fat in a liver of a patient, the method comprising:(a) applying shear waves to the liver from a plurality of locations to cause the shear waves to interfere in the liver, the shear waves optionally having a frequency offset to create crawling waves in the liver;(b) repeating step (a) over a plurality of frequencies of the shear waves;(c) during steps (a) and (b), detecting the interfering waves using a transducer;(d) analyzing the interfering waves detected in step (c) in a processor to determine a dispersion of at least one of a speed and an attenuation of the shear waves; and(℮) from the dispersion determined in step (d), assessing the fat in the liver. 2. The method of claim 1, wherein the transducer comprises an ultrasound transducer. 3. The method of claim 1, wherein step (a) comprises applying the shear waves as counter-propagating shear waves from two of said locations. 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the transducer is located between said two locations. 5. The method of claim 1, wherein the plurality of frequencies comprise frequencies within a range of 80 to 400 Hz. 6. A probe for non-invasive assessment of fat in a liver of a patient, the probe comprising:a plurality of actuators for applying shear waves to the liver from a plurality of locations to cause the shear waves to interfere in the liver, the shear waves optionally having a frequency offset to create crawling waves in the liver; anda transducer for detecting the interfering waves and for outputting a signal representing the crawling waves to a processor. 7. The probe of claim 6, wherein the transducer comprises an ultrasbufid transducer. 8. The probe of claim 6, wherein the transducer is disposed between two of said actuators. 9. The method of claim 1, further comprising:(f) storing a result of step (℮) in a database; and(g) making the database available to the processor for future assessments. 10. A system for non-invasive assessment of fat in a liver of a patient, the system comprising:a plurality of actuators for applying shear waves to the liver from a plurality of locations to cause the shear waves to interfere in the liver, the shear waves having a frequency offset to create interfering waves in the liver;a signal generator for controlling the plurality of actuators to apply the shear waves over a plurality of frequencies of the shear waves;a transducer for detecting the crawling waves and for outputting a signal representing the interfering waves;a processor, connected to the transducer to receive the signal, for analyzing the interfering waves to determine a dispersion of at least one of a speed and an attenuation of the shear waves; andan output for outputting a result of analysis from the processor. 11. The system of claim 10, wherein the transducer comprises an ultrasound transducer. 12. The system of claim 10, wherein the actuators are configured to apply the shear waves as counter-propagating shear waves from two of said locations. 13. The system of claim 12, wherein the transducer is located between said two locations. 14. The system of claim 10, wherein the signal generator is configured such that the plurality of frequencies comprise frequencies within a range of 80 to 400 Hz. 15. The system of claim 10, further comprising a database for storing the result of analysis, wherein the database is available to the processor for future assessments. 16. A method for non-invasive assessment of fat in a liver of a patient, the method comprising:(a) applying shear waves to the liver from a plurality of locations to cause the shear waves to interfere in the liver, the shear waves optionally having a frequency offset to create crawling waves in the liver; (b) repeating step (a) over a plurality of frequencies of the shear waves;(c) during steps (a) and (b), detecting the interfering waves using a transducer;(d) analyzing the interfering waves detected in step (c) in a processor to determine a dispersion of at least one of a speed and an attenuation of the shear waves; and(℮) comparing the dispersion determined in step (d) to a database of results to make an estimate of a percentage of fat in the liver; and(1) outputting the estimate.Dated this 11th day of November, 2013(Ramesh C.
