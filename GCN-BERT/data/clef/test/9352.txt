The present invention relates to a dye composition free of oxidizing agent other than atmospheric oxygen, in the form of a cream, comprising oxidation dye precursors, at least a first surfactant, at least one oil, not more than 0.5% by weight of at least one solid fatty alcohol, and at least one thickener, and also to a dyeing process using the said composition in the presence of an oxidizing agent other than atmospheric oxygen. The present invention also relates to a suitable multi-compartment device. Among the methods for dyeing human keratin fibres, such as the hair, mention may be made of oxidation dyeing or permanent dyeing. More particularly, this form of dyeing uses one or more oxidation dyes, usually one or more oxidation bases optionally combined with one or more couplers. In general, the oxidation bases are chosen from ortho- or para-phenylenediamines, ortho or para-aminophenols and heterocyclic compounds. These oxidation bases are colourless or weakly coloured compounds, which, when combined with oxidizing products, can give access to coloured species. The shades obtained with these oxidation bases are often varied by combining them with one or more couplers, these couplers being chosen especially from aromatic meta-diamines, meta-aminophenols, meta-diphenols and certain heterocyclic compounds, such as indole compounds. The variety of molecules used as oxidation bases and couplers allows a wide range of colours to be obtained. Permanent dyeing processes thus consist in using, with the dye composition containing the oxidation dyes, an aqueous composition comprising at least one oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide, under alkaline pH conditions in the vast majority of cases. The alkaline agent conventionally used is aqueous ammonia or it may be chosen from other alkaline agents, such as alkanolamines. Recently, dyeing formulations comprising fatty substance contents higher than the compositions thus far on the market have been developed. These formulations provide numerous advantages, in particular inasmuch as they make it possible to reduce the aqueous ammonia content, thus providing a very clear improvement in the user's comfort (less of an unpleasant smell and less risk of stinging), without any decrease in the dyeing performance qualities being observed, or even with them being increased. However, such formulations are complex to use on account, precisely, of this high content of fatty substances and, for example, as regards the ease of mixing with the oxidizing composition. The mixtures may take longer to produce and may require higher forces. They may also lead to a deterioration of the working qualities such as the ease of application and the rinseability. The object of the present invention is thus to improve the mixability of dye compositions with the oxidizing composition, and also the working qualities of dye compositions that are in cream form, comprising high contents of fatty substances, without causing any reduction in the dyeing performance qualities of such compositions. This aim and others are achieved by the present invention, one subject of which is thus a composition for dyeing human keratin fibres, such as the hair, which is free of oxidizing agent other than atmospheric oxygen and which is in cream form, comprising: (a) at least one oxidation dye precursor;(b) at least one ionic surfactant;(c) at least one oil;(d) optionally at least one solid fatty alcohol in a content of not more than 0.5% by weight relative to the weight of the composition;(e) at least one thickening polymer. A subject of the invention is also a dyeing process in which such a composition is used, in the presence of an oxidizing agent other than atmospheric oxygen. Finally, the invention relates to a multi-compartment device comprising a compartment containing a composition free of oxidizing agent other than atmospheric oxygen, comprising at least one oxidation dye precursor; at least one ionic surfactant; at least one oil; optionally at least one solid fatty alcohol in a content of not more than 0.5% by weight relative to the weight of the composition; at least one thickening polymer; and a compartment containing an oxidizing composition. The composition of the invention makes it possible to obtain good dyeing properties, such as strength of the colour, resistance to external agents (shampooing, perspiration, light) and homogeneity, which are particularly efficient. It also has a texture suitable for the application. Specifically, the composition according to the invention is easy to mix with the oxidizing composition and easy to apply to the fibres. Similarly, it rinses off easily after the leave-on time. Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will emerge more clearly on reading the description and the examples that follow. In the text hereinbelow, and unless otherwise indicated, the limits of a range of values are included in that range. The term “at least one” associated with an ingredient of the composition signifies “one or more”. The human keratin fibres treated by means of the process according to the invention are preferably the hair. The composition is in the form of a cream. Thus, the composition has a viscosity of at least 5 poises measured at 25° C. using a Rheomat 180 viscometer and at a shear rate of 60 s−1. Preferably, the viscosity may range from 5 poises to 500 poises, more particularly from 7 poises to 250 poises and preferably from 8 poises to 100 poises. Dyes As indicated previously, the dyeing composition according to the invention comprises at least one oxidation dye precursor. As oxidation dye precursors, use may be made of oxidation bases and couplers.

The viscosity of the silicones is measured at 25° C. according to Standard ASTM 445 Appendix C. Non-volatile polydialkylsiloxanes may also be used. These non-volatile silicones are more particularly chosen from polydialkylsiloxanes, among which mention may be made mainly of polydimethylsiloxanes containing trimethylsilyl end groups. Among these polydialkylsiloxanes, mention may be made, in a non-limiting manner, of the following commercial products: the Silbione® oils of the 47 and 70 047 series or the Mirasil® oils sold by Rhodia, such as, for example, the oil 70 047 V 500 000;the oils of the Mirasil® series sold by the company Rhodia;the oils of the 200 series from the company Dow Corning, such as DC200 with a viscosity of 60 000 mm2/s;the Viscasil® oils from General Electric and certain oils of the SF series (SF 96, SF 18) from General Electric.
