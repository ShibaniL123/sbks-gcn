CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/893,862, filed on Oct. 21, 2013, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT This invention was made with government support under grant number DE-SC0001059 awarded by the Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND A new generation of optoelectronic devices such as organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, organic light emitting transistors (OLETs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), printable circuits, electrochemical capacitors, and sensors are built upon organic semiconductors as their active components. To enable high device efficiencies such as large charge carrier mobilities (μ) needed for transistor/circuit operations, or efficient exciton formation/splitting that is necessary for OLED/OPV operations, it is desirable that both p-type and n-type organic semiconductor materials are available. Furthermore, these organic semiconductor-based devices should exhibit satisfactory stability in ambient conditions and should be processable in a cost-effective manner. For example, a benchmark polymer, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT), can provide hole mobilities in the order of about 0.1 cm2/Vs and current modulation in the order of about 105 or greater, which is close to amorphous silicon. Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells commonly are considered the most promising OPV structures because they can be fabricated using roll-to-roll and large-scale production. BHJ solar cells include a photoactive layer disposed between an anode and a cathode, where the photoactive layer is composed of a blend film including a donor material and an acceptor material. State-of-the-art BHJ solar cells use fullerene-based compounds as the acceptor material. Typical fullerenes include C60 or C70 “bucky ball” compounds functionalized with solubilizing side chains such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The most common donor material used in BHJ solar cells is poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). However, it is well known that P3HT-based cell have limited efficiency due to poor light absorption above 500 nm. Furthermore, P3HT also has poor air stability. Accordingly, the art desires new polymeric semiconducting materials as active layers in various optoelectronic devices. SUMMARY In light of the foregoing, the present teachings provide novel polymeric compounds that can be used as organic semiconductor materials. More specifically, the present polymers include at least one annulated thienyl-vinylene-thienyl (TVT) unit and at least one other pi-conjugated unit as repeating units. Also provided are associated devices and related methods for the preparation and use of these compounds. The present compounds can exhibit properties such as optimized optical absorption, good charge transport characteristics and chemical stability in ambient conditions, low-temperature processability, large solubility in common solvents, and processing versatility (e.g., via various solution processes). As a result, optoelectronic devices such as OPV cells that incorporate one or more of the present compounds as a photoactive layer can exhibit high performance in ambient conditions, for example, demonstrating one or more of low band-gap, high fill factor, high open circuit voltage, and high power conversion efficiency, and preferably all of these criteria. Similarly, other organic semiconductor-based devices such as OTFTs can be fabricated efficiently using the organic semiconductor materials described herein. The present teachings also provide methods of preparing such compounds and semiconductor materials, as well as various compositions, composites, and devices that incorporate the compounds and semiconductor materials disclosed herein. The foregoing as well as other features and advantages of the present teachings will be more fully understood from the following figures, description, examples, and claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Throughout the application, where compositions are described as having, including, or comprising specific components, or where processes are described as having, including, or comprising specific process steps, it is contemplated that compositions of the present teachings also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited components, and that the processes of the present teachings also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited process steps. In the application, where an element or component is said to be included in and/or selected from a list of recited elements or components, it should be understood that the element or component can be any one of the recited elements or components, or the element or component can be selected from a group consisting of two or more of the recited elements or components. Further, it should be understood that elements and/or features of a composition, an apparatus, or a method described herein can be combined in a variety of ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings, whether explicit or implicit herein. The use of the terms “include,” “includes”, “including,” “have,” “has,” or “having” should be generally understood as open-ended and non-limiting unless specifically stated otherwise. The use of the singular herein includes the plural (and vice versa) unless specifically stated otherwise. In addition, where the use of the term “about” is before a quantitative value, the present teachings also include the specific quantitative value itself, unless specifically stated otherwise. As used herein, the term “about” refers to a ±10% variation from the nominal value unless otherwise indicated or inferred. It should be understood that the order of steps or order for performing certain actions is immaterial so long as the present teachings remain operable. Moreover, two or more steps or actions may be conducted simultaneously. As used herein, a “p-type semiconductor material” or a “donor” material refers to a semiconductor material, for example, an organic semiconductor material, having holes as the majority current or charge carriers. In some embodiments, when a p-type semiconductor material is deposited on a substrate, it can provide a hole mobility in excess of about 10−5 cm2/Vs. In the case of field-effect devices, a p-type semiconductor also can exhibit a current on/off ratio of greater than about 10. As used herein, an “n-type semiconductor material” or an “acceptor” material refers to a semiconductor material, for example, an organic semiconductor material, having electrons as the majority current or charge carriers. In some embodiments, when an n-type semiconductor material is deposited on a substrate, it can provide an electron mobility in excess of about 10−5 cm2/Vs. In the case of field-effect devices, an n-type semiconductor also can exhibit a current on/off ratio of greater than about 10. As used herein, “mobility” refers to a measure of the velocity with which charge carriers, for example, holes (or units of positive charge) in the case of a p-type semiconductor material and electrons (or units of negative charge) in the case of an n-type semiconductor material, move through the material under the influence of an electric field. This parameter, which depends on the device architecture, can be measured using a field-effect device or space-charge limited current measurements. As used herein, a compound can be considered “ambient stable” or “stable at ambient conditions” when a transistor incorporating the compound as its semiconducting material exhibits a carrier mobility that is maintained at about its initial measurement when the compound is exposed to ambient conditions, for example, air, ambient temperature, and humidity, over a period of time. For example, a compound can be described as ambient stable if a transistor incorporating the compound shows a carrier mobility that does not vary more than 20% or more than 10% from its initial value after exposure to ambient conditions, including, air, humidity and temperature, over a 3 day, 5 day, or 10 day period. As used herein, fill factor (FF) is the ratio (given as a percentage) of the actual maximum obtainable power, (Pm or Vmp*Jmp), to the theoretical (not actually obtainable) power, (Jsc*Voc). Accordingly, FF can be determined using the equation: [in-line-formulae]FF=(Vmp*Jmp)/(Jsc*Voc)[/in-line-formulae] where Jmp and Vmp represent the current density and voltage at the maximum power point (Pm), respectively, this point being obtained by varying the resistance in the circuit until J*V is at its greatest value; and Jsc and Voc represent the short circuit current and the open circuit voltage, respectively. Fill factor is a key parameter in evaluating the performance of solar cells. Commercial solar cells typically have a fill factor of about 0.60% or greater. As used herein, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is the difference in the electrical potentials between the anode and the cathode of a device when there is no external load connected. As used herein, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a solar cell is the percentage of power converted from incident light to electrical power. The PCE of a solar cell can be calculated by dividing the maximum power point (Pm) by the input light irradiance (E, in W/m2) under standard test conditions (STC) and the surface area of the solar cell (Ac in m2). STC typically refers to a temperature of 25° C. and an irradiance of 1000 W/m2 with an air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5) spectrum. As used herein, a component (such as a thin film layer) can be considered “photoactive” if it contains one or more compounds that can absorb photons to produce excitons for the generation of a photocurrent. As used herein, “solution-processable” refers to compounds (e.g., polymers), materials, or compositions that can be used in various solution-phase processes including spin-coating, printing (e.g., inkjet printing, gravure printing, offset printing and the like), spray coating, electrospray coating, drop casting, dip coating, and blade coating. As used herein, a “semicrystalline polymer” refers to a polymer that has an inherent tendency to crystallize at least partially either when cooled from a melted state or deposited from solution, when subjected to kinetically favorable conditions such as slow cooling, or low solvent evaporation rate and so forth. The crystallization or lack thereof can be readily identified by using several analytical methods, for example, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and/or X-ray diffraction (XRD). As used herein, “annealing” refers to a post-deposition heat treatment to the semicrystalline polymer film in ambient or under reduced/increased pressure for a time duration of more than 100 seconds, and “annealing temperature” refers to the maximum temperature that the polymer film is exposed to for at least 60 seconds during this process of annealing. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that annealing can result in an increase of crystallinity in the polymer film, where possible, thereby increasing field effect mobility. The increase in crystallinity can be monitored by several methods, for example, by comparing the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the as-deposited and the annealed films. As used herein, a “polymeric compound” (or “polymer”) refers to a molecule including a plurality of one or more repeating units connected by covalent chemical bonds. A polymeric compound can be represented by the general formula: [in-line-formulae]*M*[/in-line-formulae] wherein M is the repeating unit or monomer. The polymeric compound can have only one type of repeating unit as well as two or more types of different repeating units. When a polymeric compound has only one type of repeating unit, it can be referred to as a homopolymer. When a polymeric compound has two or more types of different repeating units, the term “copolymer” or “copolymeric compound” can be used instead. For example, a copolymeric compound can include repeating units [in-line-formulae]*Ma* and *Mb* ,[/in-line-formulae] where Ma and Mb represent two different repeating units. Unless specified otherwise, the assembly of the repeating units in the copolymer can be head-to-tail, head-to-head, or tail-to-tail. In addition, unless specified otherwise, the copolymer can be a random copolymer, an alternating copolymer, or a block copolymer. For example, the general formula: [in-line-formulae]*Max-Mby*[/in-line-formulae] can be used to represent a copolymer of Ma and Mb having x mole fraction of Ma and y mole fraction of Mb in the copolymer, where the manner in which comonomers Ma and Mb is repeated can be alternating, random, regiorandom, regioregular, or in blocks. In addition to its composition, a polymeric compound can be further characterized by its degree of polymerization (n) and molar mass (e.g., number average molecular weight (Ma) and/or weight average molecular weight (Mw) depending on the measuring technique(s)). As used herein, “halo” or “halogen” refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo. As used herein, “oxo” refers to a double-bonded oxygen (i.e., ═O).

The one or more carbon-carbon double bonds can be internal (such as in 2-butene) or terminal (such as in 1-butene). In various embodiments, an alkenyl group can have 2 to 40 carbon atoms (i.e., C2-40 alkenyl group), for example, 2 to 20 carbon atoms (i.e., C2-20 alkenyl group).

In various embodiments, a cycloalkyl group can have 3 to 24 carbon atoms, for example, 3 to 20 carbon atoms (e.g., C3-14 cycloalkyl group). A cycloalkyl group can be monocyclic (e.g., cyclohexyl) or polycyclic (e.g., containing fused, bridged, and/or spiro ring systems), where the carbon atoms are located inside or outside of the ring system. Any suitable ring position of the cycloalkyl group can be covalently linked to the defined chemical structure. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, cycloheptatrienyl, norbornyl, norpinyl, norcaryl, adamantyl, and spiro[4.5]decanyl groups, as well as their homologs, isomers, and the like.

Compounds of the present teachings can include a “divalent group” defined herein as a linking group capable of forming a covalent bond with two other moieties. For example, compounds of the present teachings can include a divalent C1-20 alkyl group (e.g., a methylene group), a divalent C2-20 alkenyl group (e.g., a vinylyl group), a divalent C2-20 alkynyl group (e.g., an ethynylyl group). a divalent C6-14 aryl group (e.g., a phenylyl group); a divalent 3-14 membered cycloheteroalkyl group (e.g., a pyrrolidylyl), and/or a divalent 5-14 membered heteroaryl group (e.g., a thienylyl group). Generally, a chemical group (e.g., —Ar—) is understood to be divalent by the inclusion of the two bonds before and after the group. The electron-donating or electron-withdrawing properties of several hundred of the most common substituents, reflecting all common classes of substituents have been determined, quantified, and published. The most common quantification of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing properties is in terms of Hammett σ values. Hydrogen has a Hammett σ value of zero, while other substituents have Hammett σ values that increase positively or negatively in direct relation to their electron-withdrawing or electron-donating characteristics. Substituents with negative Hammett σ values are considered electron-donating, while those with positive Hammett σ values are considered electron-withdrawing. See Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, 12th ed., McGraw Hill, 1979, Table 3-12, pp. 3-134 to 3-138, which lists Hammett σ values for a large number of commonly encountered substituents and is incorporated by reference herein. It should be understood that the term “electron-accepting group” can be used synonymously herein with “electron acceptor” and “electron-withdrawing group”. In particular, an “electron-withdrawing group” (“EWG”) or an “electron-accepting group” or an “electron-acceptor” refers to a functional group that draws electrons to itself more than a hydrogen atom would if it occupied the same position in a molecule. Examples of electron-withdrawing groups include, but are not limited to, halogen or halo (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), —NO2, —CN, —NC, —S(R0)2+, —N(R0)3+, —SO3H, —SO2R0, —SO3R0, —SO2NHR0, —SO2N(R0)2, —COOH, —COR0, —COOR0, —CONHR0, —CON(R0)2, C1-40 haloalkyl groups, C6-14 aryl groups, and 5-14 membered electron-poor heteroaryl groups; where R0 is a C1-20 alkyl group, a C2-20 alkenyl group, a C2-20 alkynyl group, a C1-20 haloalkyl group, a C1-20 alkoxy group, a C6-14 aryl group, a C3-14 cycloalkyl group, a 3-14 membered cycloheteroalkyl group, and a 5-14 membered heteroaryl group, each of which can be optionally substituted as described herein. For example, each of the C1-20 alkyl group, the C2-20 alkenyl group, the C2-20 alkynyl group, the C1-20 haloalkyl group, the C1-20 alkoxy group, the C6-14 aryl group, the C3-14 cycloalkyl group, the 3-14 membered cycloheteroalkyl group, and the 5-14 membered heteroaryl group can be optionally substituted with 1-5 small electron-withdrawing groups such as F, Cl, Br, —NO2, —CN, —NC, —S(R0)2+, —N(R0)3+, —SO3H, —SO2R0, —SO3R0, —SO2NHR0, —SO2N(R0)2, —COOH, —COR0, —COOR0, —CONHR0, and —CON(R0)2. It should be understood that the term “electron-donating group” can be used synonymously herein with “electron donor”. In particular, an “electron-donating group” or an “electron-donor” refers to a functional group that donates electrons to a neighboring atom more than a hydrogen atom would if it occupied the same position in a molecule. Examples of electron-donating groups include —OH, —OR0, —NH2, —NHR0, —N(R0)2, and 5-14 membered electron-rich heteroaryl groups, where R0 is a C1-20 alkyl group, a C2-20 alkenyl group, a C2-20 alkynyl group, a C6-14 aryl group, or a C3-14 cycloalkyl group. Various unsubstituted heteroaryl groups can be described as electron-rich (or π-excessive) or electron-poor (or π-deficient). Such classification is based on the average electron density on each ring atom as compared to that of a carbon atom in benzene. Examples of electron-rich systems include 5-membered heteroaryl groups having one heteroatom such as furan, pyrrole, and thiophene; and their benzofused counterparts such as benzofuran, benzopyrrole, and benzothiophene. Examples of electron-poor systems include 6-membered heteroaryl groups having one or more heteroatoms such as pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine, and pyrimidine; as well as their benzofused counterparts such as quinoline, isoquinoline, quinoxaline, cinnoline, phthalazine, naphthyridine, quinazoline, phenanthridine, acridine, and purine. Mixed heteroaromatic rings can belong to either class depending on the type, number, and position of the one or more heteroatom(s) in the ring. See Katritzky, A. R and Lagowski, J. M., Heterocyclic Chemistry (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1960). At various places in the present specification, substituents are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the description include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges.

In particular embodiments, the fullerene can be a C60 fullerene derivative or a C70 fullerene derivative, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or simply PCBM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). In some embodiments, chemically modified fullerenes can be used, provided that the modified fullerene retains acceptor-type and electron mobility characteristics. Some common fullerene derivatives include bisadduct of PC61BM (Bis-PCBM), indene-C60 monoadduct (ICMA), and indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA). Further, other acceptor materials can be used in place of fullerenes, provided that they have the required acceptor-type and electron mobility characteristics. For example, the acceptor material can be various organic small molecules, polymers, carbon nanotubes, or inorganic particles (quantum dots, quantum rods, quantum tripods, TiO2, ZnO etc.). In some embodiments, the acceptor material can be an electron-transporting (n-type) polymer. In some embodiments, the electron-transporting polymer can comprise a bis(imide)arene unit. Exemplary polymers are described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2010/0326527, 2010/0326527, and 2010/0283047. In some embodiments, the bulk heterojunction solar cells according to the present teachings can incorporate a blend material (e.g., a blended film) including a polymer of the present teachings as the acceptor material and a donor material as the photoactive layer. For example, embodiments of the present polymers that can function as an acceptor material (i.e., an n-type semiconducting polymer) include those having a bis(imide)arene unit, for example, a naphthalene diimide, as the pi-2 moiety. Many donor polymers have been reported, the most well known being poly(3-hexylthiophene) or P3HT. Many donor polymers have an alternating push-pull structure: [in-line-formulae]*D-A*[/in-line-formulae] where the donor subunit (D) often includes a bridged dithiophene moiety (such as a benzodithiophene moiety, a naphthodithiophene moiety, a thienodithiophene moiety, and a pyridodithiophene moiety); the acceptor subunit (A) can include an electron-poor conjugated moiety; and either the donor subunit (D) or the acceptor subunit (A) can comprise one or more thienyl or thienothienyl groups. Suitable donor polymers are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2013/0247992 and Facchetti, “Pi-Conjugated Polymers for Organic Electronics and Photovoltaic Cell Applications,” Chem. Mater., 23:733-758 (2011). In alternative embodiments where the annulated TVT unit is copolymerized with an electron-donating polycyclic moiety, the present polymers can function as a donor material (i.e., a p-type semiconducting polymer). Such p-type semiconducting polymer can be used together with a fullerene-based acceptor material or an n-type semiconducting polymer (including an n-type semiconducting polymer according to the present teachings) in a solar cell. A photoactive component according to the present teachings can be prepared as a blended film deposited from a solution or dispersion containing a mixture of one or more of the present compounds and either an acceptor compound such as fullerene (e.g., PCBM) or a polymeric acceptor described herein, or a donor polymer. The ratio of the donor polymer to the acceptor compound can range from about 10:1 to about 1:10 by weight; for example, from about 5:1 to about 1:5 by weight, from about 3:1 to about 1:3 by weight, or from about 2:1 to about 1:2 by weight. The photoactive layer also can contain a polymeric binder, which can be present from about 5 to about 95% by weight. The polymeric binder, for example, can be a semicrystalline polymer selected from polystyrene (PS), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). In some embodiments, the polymeric blend can be used together with additional components that are optically active, for example, components that can assist in light harvesting by capturing and transferring excitons to one or both of the electron-donor polymers/electron-acceptor polymers in the blend, and/or optically non-active components to modify and/or improve processing and/or device performance. Such optically non-active components can include alkanethiols (e.g., alkanedithiols) and other α,ω-functionalized alkanes (e.g., diiodoalkanes) as known in the art. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,227,691. The blend composition can be deposited on a substrate (e.g., an electrode-substrate) preferably via a solution-phase process, followed by removal of the solvent or mixture of solvents to provide the photoactive layer. By having the blend composition provided as an intimate mixture of the present polymer and an acceptor compound, bulk heterojunctions are created upon removal of the solvent (optionally under reduced pressure and/or elevated temperature), during which nanoscale phase separation of the present donor polymers and the acceptor compound takes place. In some embodiments, the depositing step can be carried out by printing, including inkjet printing and various contact printing techniques (e.g., screen-printing, gravure printing, offset printing, pad printing, lithographic printing, flexographic printing, and microcontact printing). In other embodiments, the depositing step can be carried out by spin coating, slot-die coating, drop-casting, zone casting, dip coating, blade coating, or spraying. When the film is formed by spin coating, the spin speed can range from about 300 rpm to about 6000 rpm, or from about 500 rpm to about 2000 rpm. Subsequent processing steps can include thermal annealing or irradiation of the deposited film. For example, the blended film can be annealed from about 50° C. to about 300° C., preferably from about 70° C. to about 200° C., more preferably from about 90° C. to about 180° C. for about 1 min to about 20 minutes. The annealing step can be carried out under an inert atmosphere (e.g., under nitrogen). Irradiation of the deposited film can be carried out using infrared light or ultraviolet light. As used herein, “annealing” refers to a post-deposition heat treatment to the semicrystalline polymer film in ambient or under reduced/increased pressure for a time duration of more than 60 seconds, and “annealing temperature” refers to the maximum temperature that the polymer film is exposed to for at least 30 seconds during this process of annealing. The photoactive layer typically can have a thickness ranging from about 30 nm to about 500 nm. In preferred embodiments, the photoactive layer can be a thin film having a thickness of about 80-300 nm. FIG. 1 illustrates a representative structure of a bulk-heterojunction organic solar cell which can incorporate one or more compounds of the present teachings as either the donor material or the acceptor material. As shown, a representative solar cell 20 generally includes an anode 22, a cathode 26, and a photoactive layer 24 between the anode and the cathode that can incorporate one or more polymers of the present teachings as either the electron donor (p-channel) material or the electron acceptor (n-channel) material. In some embodiments, an optional smoothing layer can be present between the anode and the photoactive layer. The substrate 28 can be a solid, rigid or flexible layer designed to provide robustness to the device. In preferred embodiments, the substrate can be transparent or semi-transparent in the spectral region of interest. As used herein, a material is considered “transparent” when it has transmittance over 50%, and a material is considered “semi-transparent” when it has transmittance between about 50% and about 5%. The substrate can comprise any suitable material known in the art such as glass or a flexible plastic (polymer) film. The first and second electrodes should have different work functions, with the electrode having the higher work function at or above about 4.5 eV (the “high work function electrode”) serving as the hole-injecting electrode or anode, and the electrode having the lower work function at or below about 4.3 eV (the “low work function electrode”) serving as the electron-injecting electrode. In a traditional OPV device structure, the high work function electrode or anode typically is composed of a transparent conducting metal oxide or metal sulfide such as indium tin oxide (ITO), gallium indium tin oxide (GITO), and zinc indium tin oxide (ZITO), or a thin, transparent layer of gold or silver. The low work function electrode or cathode typically is composed of a low work function metal such as aluminum, indium, calcium, barium, and magnesium. The electrodes can be deposited by thermal vapor deposition, electron beam evaporation, RF or magnetron sputtering, chemical vapor deposition or the like. In various embodiments, the solar cell can include one or more optional interface layers (“interlayers”) between the anode and the photoactive layer and/or between the cathode and the photoactive layer. For example, in some embodiments, an optional smoothing layer (e.g., a film of 3,4-polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT), or 3,4-polyethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrene-sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)) can be present between the anode and the photoactive layer. The optional interlayer(s) can perform other functions such as reducing the energy barrier between the photoactive layer and the electrode, forming selective contacts for a single type of carrier (e.g., a hole-blocking layer), modifying the work function of the adjacent electrode, and/or protecting the underlying photoactive layer. In some embodiments, a transition metal oxide layer such as V2O5, MoO3, WO3 and NiO can be deposited on top of the ITO anode, instead of using PEDOT or PEDOT:PSS as the p-type buffer. To improve device stability via modification of the cathode, an n-type buffer composed of LiF, CsF or similar fluorides can be provided between the cathode and the photoactive layer. Other n-type buffer materials include TiOx, ZnOx and Cs-doped TiOx. Depending on the composition, the interlayers can be solution-processed (e.g., sol-gel deposition, self-assembled monolayers) or deposited by vacuum processes such as thermal evaporation or sputtering. In certain embodiments, a solar cell according to the present teachings can include a transparent glass substrate onto which an electrode layer (anode) made of indium tin oxide (ITO) is applied. This electrode layer can have a relatively rough surface, and a smoothing layer made of a polymer, typically PEDOT:PSS made electrically conductive through doping, can be applied on top of the electrode layer to enhance its surface morphology. Other similar interlayers can be optionally present between the anode and the photoactive layer for improving mechanical, chemical, and/or electronic properties of the device. The photoactive layer is composed of an all-polymer blend as described above, and can have a layer thickness of, e.g., about 80 nm to a few μm. Before a counter electrode (cathode) is applied, an electrically insulating transition layer can be applied onto the photoactive layer. This transition layer can be made of an alkali halide, e.g., LiF, and can be vapor-deposited in vacuum. Again, similar to the anode, other similar interlayers can be optionally present between the photoactive layer and the cathode for improving mechanical, chemical, and/or electronic properties of the device. In certain embodiments, a solar cell according to the present teachings can have an inverted device structure, where a modified ITO film is used as the cathode. For example, the ITO can be modified by n-type metal oxides or metal carbonates such as TiOx, ZnOx, Cs-doped TiOx, and caesium carbonate. In particular embodiments, the inverted OPV can include a solution-processed ZnOx n-type interface layer as described in Lloyd et al., “Influence of the hole-transport layer on the initial behavior and lifetime of inverted organic photovoltaics,” Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 95(5): 1382-1388 (2011). Compared with the traditional device structure, inverted-type devices can demonstrate better long-term ambient stability by avoiding the need for the corrosive and hygroscopic hole-transporting PEDOT:PSS and low work function metal cathode. The anode of an inverted OPV cell can be composed of Ag, Au, and the like, with an optional p-type interface layer composed of transition metal oxides such as V2O5, MoO3, WO3 and NiO. Another aspect of the present teachings relates to methods of fabricating an organic light-emitting transistor or an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) that incorporates one or more semiconductor materials of the present teachings. For example, in an OLED, one or more compounds of the present teachings can be used as electron-transporting and/or emissive and/or hole-transporting materials. An OLED generally includes a substrate, a transparent anode (e.g., ITO), a cathode (e.g., metal), and one or more organic layers which can incorporate one or more compounds of the present teachings as hole-transporting (p-channel) and/or emissive and/or electron-transporting (n-channel) materials. In embodiments where the present compounds only have one or two of the properties of hole transport, electron transport, and emission, the present compounds can be blended with one or more further organic compounds having the remaining required property or properties. In other embodiments, the article of manufacture can be an electronic or optoelectronic device (e.g., an organic light-emitting transistor) including a first electrode, a second electrode, and a semiconducting component in contact with the first electrode and the second electrode, where the semiconducting component includes a compound of the present teachings. These devices can include a composite having a semiconducting component (or semiconductor material) of the present teachings and a substrate component and/or a dielectric component. The substrate component can be selected from doped silicon, an indium tin oxide (ITO), ITO-coated glass, ITO-coated polyimide or other plastics, aluminum or other metals alone or coated on a polymer or other substrate, a doped polythiophene, and the like. The dielectric component can be prepared from inorganic dielectric materials such as various oxides (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3, HfO2), organic dielectric materials such as various polymeric materials (e.g., polycarbonate, polyester, polystyrene, polyhaloethylene, polyacrylate), and self-assembled superlattice/self-assembled nanodielectric (SAS/SAND) materials (e.g., as described in Yoon, M-H. et al., PNAS, 102 (13): 4678-4682 (2005), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein), as well as hybrid organic/inorganic dielectric materials (e.g., described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/642,504, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein). In some embodiments, the dielectric component can include the crosslinked polymer blends described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/315,076, 60/816,952, and 60/861,308, the entire disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference herein. The composite also can include one or more electrical contacts. Suitable materials for the source, drain, and gate electrodes include metals (e.g., Au, Al, Ni, Cu), transparent conducting oxides (e.g., ITO, IZO, ZITO, GZO, GIO, GITO), and conducting polymers (e.g., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy)). The following examples are provided to illustrate further and to facilitate the understanding of the present teachings and are not in any way intended to limit the invention. All reagents were commercially available and were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Anhydrous dichloromethane was distilled from CaH2. Unless otherwise stated, all reactions were carried out under inert atmosphere using standard Schlenk line techniques. NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Unity Plus 500 (500 MHz, room temperature) or Mercury (400 MHz, high temperature) spectrometers, and chemical shifts are referenced to residual protio-solvent signals.

Various synthetic routes to 5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[b]thiophen-4-one are known in the art. For example, as described in International Publication No. WO2006084688, thiophene can be reacted with N,N-dimethyl-2-propenamide as a mixture with triflic anhydride in DCE as shown in the above scheme.

Example 1d Synthesis of stannylated (E)-4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4,4′,5,5′-tetrahydro-6,6′-bi(cyclopenta[b]thiophenylidene) (C52EHTVT-tin) Synthesis of 10: To a solution of (2-ethylhexyl)magnesium bromide (1 M in Et2O, 22 mmol), a solution of 3-thiophene carboxaldehyde 8 (1.8 mL, 20 mmol) in 5 mL of Et2O was added over 10 min at 0° C. The reaction mixture was warmed to 25° C. and stirred for 23 h. The mixture was poured into a mixture of ice water (80 mL) and conc. HCl (15 mL), and extracted with Et2O (100 mL×3). The organic phases were dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to afford a brown oil of the intermediate alcohol 9. The alcohol 9 was dissolved in acetic acid (10 mL), and a solution of Cr(VI)O3 (2.1 g, 21 mmol) in 15 mL of acetic acid/water (2:1) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h at 25° C. After the further addition of water (30 mL), the mixture was extracted with Et2O (80 mL×3).

Alternative Synthesis of 10: Alternatively, the 3-acetylthiophene 8 can be synthesized from 3-bromothiophene as described in the scheme above, which then can be used to prepare the ketone 14 as described below. Synthesis of 12: To a solution of triethyl phosphonoacetate (9.4 mL, 48 mmol) in THF (35 mL) was added a 2.5 M hexane solution of n-BuLi (19.5 mL, 49 mmol) dropwise at −60° C. under a N2 atmosphere over 15 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2.5 h at −60° C., and then a THF solution of the 3-acetylthiophene 8 (3.52 g, 16 mmol) was added over 20 min. The dark orange solution was gradually warmed to 25° C., and stirred for 24 h at 25° C. and 48 h at 65° C. The solution was treated with aqueous NH4Cl and HCl, and extracted with CH2Cl2 (100 mL×3). The organic phases were dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to give a brown oil. The product was purified by silica gel chromatography (CH2Cl2/hexane=2:1) to afford a yellow oil as a second fraction corresponding to the intermediate ester 11. A mixture of the ester 11 and an aqueous solution of NaOH (10%) in EtOH was heated to reflux for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25° C., and poured into a 10% aqueous solution of HCl. The mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL×3), washed with water, and dried over Na2SO4. The resulting organic phase was dried under vaccum to yield a clear, colorless oil corresponding to a mixture of the Z and E isomers of the unsaturated carboxylic acid 12 (yield 84%). Main isomer: 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): d (ppm)=0.79-0.87 (m, 6H), 1.15-1.32 (m, 9H), 2.40 (d, J=5.5 Hz, 2H), 5.85 (s, 1H), 7.04-7.05 (m, 1H), 7.25-7.28 (m, 2H). 13C NMR (126 MHz, CDCl3): d (ppm)=10.86, 14.42, 23.26, 25.81, 28.88, 32.60, 37.53, 45.60, 117.54, 124.49, 124.97, 128.28, 139.02, 156.14, 170.57. Synthesis of 14: Pd/C (300 mg, 10 wt %) and ammonium formate (845 mg, 13 mmol) were added to an isopropyl alcohol solution of the unsaturated carboxylic acid 12 (1.19 g, 4.4 mmol) under a N2 atmosphere. The mixture was stirred overnight at 80° C., and then concentrated. The mixture was dissolved in CH2Cl2, filtered through a Celite® pad, and evaporated under reduced pressure to afford the intermediate saturated carboxylic acid 13 as a clear, colorless oil.

Example 3 Characterization of Monomers and Polymers Table 1 below provides optical absorption data of certain embodiments of the present compounds in chloroform solution, as well as the optical band gaps estimated from the low energy band edge. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is noted that the optical absorption maxima and the absorption onset suggest a low energy gap for the monomer C5TVT (4) as compared to TVT which is probably due to annulation. In addition, the polymers having the fused five (C5TVT or C5RTVT) fusion (co-monomer 5 and 16 in the polymerization) exhibit a considerable red shift of the absorption maxima and/or a lower optical bandgap compared to the corresponding polymers with either a dithiophene (T2) co-monomer or a thienylvinylene (TVT) comonomer. This result could be ascribed to the increased planarization of the co-monomer, its more rigid structure, as well as the electron-donating properties of the C5 annulation. That planarization is the major factor affecting absorption is clear by the fact that when a fused six (C6RTVT) unit (co-monomer 7) is used, the optical absorption blue shifts and the bandgap is expanded.

To investigate the redox properties of the present compounds, cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using a THF-(NBu)4PF6 solvent-electrolyte solution, Pt as the working electrode, silver as the pseudo-reference electrode and ferrocene (0.54 V vs SCE) as the internal standard. The Pt working electrode was coated with a thin polymer film by drop-casting a CHCl3 solution. Exemplary redox potential data including estimated frontier molecular orbital energies are provided in Table 2. These data evidence that in the case of the naphthalene-containing polymers the LUMO energy is pinned, as in the case of P(NDI-C5TVT). Thus, the effect of the C5 annulation of TVT mainly is on the energy of the HOMO.

Example 4 Device Fabrication and Characterization Top-gate bottom-contact transistor (TFT) devices (50-100 μm channel lengths (L) and 1.0-4.0 mm channel widths (W)) were fabricated with the semiconductors films deposited by spin-coating a solution of chlorinated solvents (2-10 mg/mL) on top of Au electrodes/glass substrates. Next, the gate dielectric layer was spin-coated. Examples of gate dielectrics are PMMA, PS, PVA, PTBS and have thicknesses of 300-1500 nm. The device was completed by deposition of the gate Au contact. All electrical measurements were performed in ambient atmosphere. A Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system was used to perform all electrical/TFT characterizations concerning the devices. The 4200 SCS system consists of three source measurement units (SMU), all of which are supplied with remote pre-amplifiers. The other major component of the test system is a Signatone probe station. Triax cable and probes were used for all electrodes to provide the first level of shielding. A dark/metal box enclosure was used to avoid light exposure and to further reduce environmental noise. The dark box had a triax cable feedthrough panel to maintain consistent triax shielding all the way from the preamps to the end of triax probe tips. Transistor carrier mobilities (μ) were calculated by standard field effect transistor equations. In traditional metal-insulator-semiconductor FETs (MISFETs), there is typically a linear and saturated regime in the IDS vs VDS curves at different VG (where IDS is the source-drain saturation current, VDS is the potential between the source and drain, and VG is the gate voltage). At large VDS, the current saturates and is given by: [in-line-formulae](IDS)sat=(WCi/2L)μ(VG−Vt)2 (1)[/in-line-formulae] where L and W are the device channel length and width, respectively, Ci is the capacitance of the gate insulator, and Vt is the threshold voltage. Mobilities (μ) were calculated in the saturation regime by rearranging equation (1): [in-line-formulae]μsat=(2IDSL)/[WCi(VG−Vt)2] (2)[/in-line-formulae] The threshold voltage (Vt) can be estimated as the x intercept of the linear section of the plot of VG versus (IDS)1/2. Table 3 summarizes the transistor performance parameters measured under ambient conditions including the field-effect electron and hole mobilities (pt, in saturation unless indicated), current on-to-off ratio (Ion:Ioff), and turn-on voltage (Von) calculated from Vg=0 V to Vg=+/−60-80 V.

Immediately before deposition of the hole-injection layer, the substrates were UV ozone treated for 20 minutes in a JELIGHT UVO Cleaner® 42. An 8-nm film of MoO3 was deposited onto the ITO thermally under a vacuum of ˜10−6 Torr as the hole-injection layer. Active layers comprising blends of polymer:PC71BM (in embodiments where the present polymer functions as the donor material) or polymer:polymer (in embodiments where the present polymer functions as the acceptor material) at weight ratios varying from 1:4 to 4:1 donor:acceptor, were spin cast from organic solvent solutions (e.g., chloroform: 1,2-dichlorobenzene (9:1 by volume)). To complete the device fabrication, 0.6 nm of LiF and 100 nm of aluminum were successively deposited thermally under vacuum of ˜10−6 Torr. The active area of the device was ˜0.09 cm2. The devices were then encapsulated with a cover glass using EPO-TEK OG112-6 UV curable epoxy (Epoxy Technology) in the glove box. The photovoltaic characteristics of the encapsulated devices were tested in air. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves were obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The photocurrent was measured under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (Newport 91160A 300W Class-A Solar Simulator, 2 inch by 2 inch uniform beam) with air mass 1.5 global filter.
