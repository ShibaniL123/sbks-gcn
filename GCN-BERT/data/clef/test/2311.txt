The aqueous dispersion of the present invention has high dispersion stability. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS The present invention is described in detail below. The production method of the present invention includes emulsion polymerization of vinylidene fluoride [VDF] to provide an aqueous dispersion that contains polyvinylidene fluoride [PVDF]. In the production method of the present invention, VDF as a radical-polymerizable monomer alone may be polymerized, or VDF and other fluorinated or non-fluorinated monomers copolymerizable with VDF may be polymerized. In view of the productivity, it is preferred that vinylidene fluoride alone is polymerized. The production method of the present invention features polymerization of VDF in the presence of a surfactant that has a surface tension of 55 mN/m or smaller when added in an amount of 1000 ppm, an organic peroxide, and water. The surfactant that has a surface tension of 55 mN/m or smaller enables production of an aqueous dispersion containing polyvinylidene fluoride with high productivity. The upper limit of the surface tension of the surfactant is preferably 54 mN/m, more preferably 53 mN/m, and still more preferably 50 mN/m. The lower limit of the surface tension of the surfactant is preferably 5 mN/m, more preferably 7 mN/m, and still more preferably 10 mN/m. The surface tension can be determined with, for example, a surface tension meter. The surfactant is preferably at least one of the surfactants represented by the following Formulae (1) to (3). The double-chain surfactants represented by Formulae (1) to (3) enable production of an aqueous dispersion that contains polyvinylidene fluoride with high productivity. The surfactants represented by Formula (1): wherein R1 and R2 independently represent a C1 to C14 alkyl or halogenated alkyl group; the alkyl or halogenated alkyl group may contain an oxygen atom between carbon atoms if the alkyl or halogenated alkyl group contains 2 to 14 carbons; R3 represents H or -(CH2)v-COOM1; R4 represents - SO3M2 or -(CH2)v-COOM1; v represents an integer of 0 to 3; M1 and M2 independently represent H, NR4, or an alkali metal; and four Rs independently represent H or a C1 to C3 alkyl group.

The surfactants represented by Formula (3): wherein R7 and R8 independently represent a C1 to C14 alkyl or halogenated alkyl group; the alkyl or halogenated alkyl group may contain an oxygen atom between carbon atoms if the alkyl or halogenated alkyl group contains 2 to 14 carbons; R9 represents -SO3M2 or -COOM1; M1 and M2 independently represent H, NR4, or an alkali metal; four Rs independently represent H or a C1 to C3 alkyl group; and w represents an integer of 0 to 3. In Formula (2), R5 and R6 each may be a linear-chain or branched alkyl or halogenated alkyl group. Examples of the surfactant represented by Formula (2) include ammonium 2,2-dioctylmalonate. In Formula (3), R7 and R8 each may be a linear-chain or branched alkyl or halogenated alkyl group. Examples of the surfactant represented by Formula (3) include sodium 9-heptadecanesulfonate. The organic peroxide is used as a polymerization initiator. If VDF is polymerized at high temperatures using a polymerization initiator other than organic peroxide, for example, a persulfate, a gelled product is obtained, and the aqueous dispersion is not obtained accordingly. Additionally, the resultant PVDF is colored by heating, thus is unusable at high temperatures. Examples of the organic peroxide include dialkylperoxides such as di-t-butylperoxide, di-t-hexylperoxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexane, and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexyne-3; hydroperoxides such as 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutylhydroperoxide and t-butylhydroperoxide; diacylperoxides such as isobutylperoxide, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoylperoxide, octanoylperoxide, lauroylperoxide, stearoylperoxide, succinic acid peroxide, and bis(ω-hydrododecafluoroheptanoyl)peroxide; peroxydicarbonates such as dinormalpropyl peroxydicarbonate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, bis(4-t-butylcyclohexyl)peroxydicarbonate, di-2-ethoxyethyl peroxydicarbonate, di-2-ethylhexyl peroxydicarbonate, di-2-methoxybutyl peroxydicarbonate, and diethyl peroxydicarbonate; and peroxyesters such as 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl peroxyneodecanoate, 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethyl peroxyneodecanoate, t-hexyl peroxyneodecanoate, t-butyl peroxyneodecanoate, t-hexyl peroxypivalate, t-butyl peroxypivalate, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexanoylperoxy)hexane, 1-cyclohexyl-1-methylethyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, t-hexyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, t-butyl peroxyisobutyrate, t-hexyl peroxyisopropylmonocarbonate, t-butyl peroxy-3,5,5-trimethylhexanoate, t-butyl peroxylaurate, t-butyl peroxyisopropylmonocarbonate, t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexylmonocarbonate, and t-butyl peroxyacetate.

As needed, the organic peroxide may be used in combination with a reducing agent such as Rongalite, ascorbic acid, tartaric acid, sodium disulfite, isoascorbic acid, and iron (II) sulfate. The amount of the organic peroxide is preferably 1 to 10,000 ppm based on water, and more preferably 300 to 3,500 ppm. Each of these values is the amount of organic peroxide present at the beginning of the polymerization. The organic peroxide may be further added after the start of the polymerization. Use of any of the surfactants represented by Formulae (1) to (3) is also important to achieve emulsion polymerization at high temperatures. For example, if ammonium perfluorohexanoate and a reactive compound are used as taught in Patent Literature 3, a PVDF aqueous dispersion having excellent dispersion stability will not be obtained. The amount of the surfactants represented by Formulae (1) to (3) is preferably 10 to 30,000 ppm based on water, and more preferably 50 to 10,000 ppm. Polymerization in the presence of any of the surfactants represented by Formulae (1) to (3) and the organic peroxide enables emulsion polymerization at high temperatures. This not only improves the productivity, but also allows the resultant PVDF to have a desired crystallinity and a desired melting point. The surfactant is more preferably a surfactant represented by Formula (4): CnX12n+1-OOC-CH (SO3M2)-CH2-COO-CmX22m+1 wherein n and m independently represent an integer of 3 to 10; X1 and X2 independently represent H, F, Cl, Br, or I; M2 represents H, NR4, or an alkali metal; and four Rs independently represent H or a C1 to C3 alkyl group.

The amount of the surfactant represented by Formula (4) is preferably 10 to 30,000 ppm based on water, and more preferably 50 to 10,000 ppm. The polymerization can be performed as follows. Specifically, a polymerization vessel is charged with water, the surfactant, and the monomers such as VDF, and then the organic peroxide is added thereto. The monomers can be polymerized under stirring. The polymerization time may be 1 to 30 hours. The emulsion polymerization pressure is preferably 0.5 to 5.0 MPa, and more preferably 1.0 to 4.5 MPa. The emulsion polymerization temperature may be changed in accordance with desired properties of the polymer by selecting an appropriate initiator. The emulsion polymerization temperature may be 10°C to 200°C. In the production method of the present invention, a molecular weight regulator or any other additive may be added. The molecular weight regulator may be added at one time in the beginning of the polymerization, or may be added continuously or intermittently. Examples of the molecular weight regulator include esters such as dimethyl malonate, diethyl malonate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, and dimethyl succinate, isopentane, isopropanol, acetone, mercaptans, carbon tetrachloride, cyclohexane, monoiodomethane, 1-iodomethane, 1-iodopropane, isopropyl iodide, diiodomethane, 1,2-diiodomethane, and 1,3-diiodopropane.
