FIGS. 1-4 illustrate a device 100, in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure. As illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, device 100 includes a portion 110, a portion 120, and a portion 130. Portion 110, which may also be referred to herein as a “u-shaped portion” or a “chin support,” is configured to receive a portion of a head of a user. More specifically, in one example, portion 110 is configured to be positioned adjacent to and in contact with a portion of the user's head. In a more specific example, a user may position his or her jaw, and possibly his or her chin, in contact with portion 110. It is noted that a size of portion 110 may vary to provide suitable stability and comfort for various sized users. Further, in one embodiment, a strip of material (e.g., a rubber strip), which, for example, may comprise a pad (e.g., a padded cushion), may be positioned adjacent to and in contact with portion 110. As an example, the strip of material may be affixed to portion 110 via an adhesive. In one non-limiting example, the strip of material may comprise a neoprene strip. As will be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art, the strip may provide a cushion (i.e., padding) to a user. Portion 120, which may also be referred to herein as a “angular portion,” extends from portion 110 and includes a first piece 122 and a second piece 124, which is at an angle Θ1 with respect to first piece 122. First piece 122 may extend from portion 130 and second piece 124 may extend from portion 110. It is noted that although angle Θ1 between first piece 122 and second piece is depicted as being approximately 90 degrees, the present disclosure is not so limited. Rather, angle Θ1 may comprise any suitable sized angle, and angle Θ1 may vary depending on a size of device 100. Portion 120 may also include a third piece 125, which extends from and is at an angle relative to first piece 122. In one non-limiting example, third piece 125 is substantially perpendicular to piece 122. Portion 120 may also include a fourth piece 127, which extends from and is at an angle relative to second piece 124. In one non-limiting example, an angle between fourth piece 127 and second piece 124 is an acute angle. Further, one surface of fourth piece 127 may abut a surface of portion 130. Portion 130, which may also be referred to herein as a “chest portion” is configured to be positioned adjacent to and in contact with a portion of the user's chest. Stated another way, portion 130 may be configured for resting on the user's chest, and may provide support and help keep device 100 in a desired position. As illustrated in at least FIG. 2, portion 130 is at an angle to and extends from piece 125 of portion 120. In one non-limiting example, the angle between piece 125 and portion 130 is an acute angle. Further, one surface of fourth piece 127 may abut a surface of portion 110. According to one embodiment, at least one side of portion 130 may be substantially planar (i.e., for contacting a user's chest area). Further, it is noted that a size and shape of portion 130 may vary to provide suitable stability and comfort. Further, the bottom portion 130 may include a strip of material (e.g., a rubber material) that may act as a non-sticky adhesive on bottom portion 130 and may aid to keep bottom portion 130 comfortable for a user and in place whether bottom portion 130 is placed on the user's skin or clothing. In one example, the strip may be affixed to bottom portion 130 via any suitable manner, such as an adhesive. The strip of material may comprise, for example only, a synthetic rubber, such as a neoprene strip. According to one embodiment, the strip of material may comprise a pad (e.g., a cushioned pad), which may provide a cushion (i.e., padding) to a user. FIG. 5 illustrates device 100 including a strip 302 configured to be positioned adjacent a surface of portion 130. As will be understood, strip 302, which may comprise, for example only, a material (e.g., a rubber material, such as neoprene), may be affixed (e.g. via an adhesive) to a surface of portion 130 and may be positioned adjacent to and in contact with a user (e.g., in contact with a user's chest) during use of device 100. Stated another way, strip 302 may be configured to be positioned between a surface of portion 130 and a user. Strip 302, which may also be referred to as a “pad,” may provide a cushion (i.e., padding) to a user. FIG. 5 further illustrates a strip 304 configured to be positioned adjacent a surface of portion 110. As will be understood, strip 304, which may comprise a piece of material (e.g., a rubber material, such as neoprene), may be affixed (e.g., via an adhesive) to a surface of portion 110 and may be positioned adjacent to an in contact with a user (e.g., in contact with a user's chin and/or jaw) during use of device 100. Stated another way, strip 304 may be configured to be positioned between a surface of portion 110 and a user. Strip 304, which may also be referred to as a “pad,” may provide a cushion (i.e., padding) to a user. According to one embodiment, each of strip 302 and strip 304 may be removable and/or replaceable. Further, each of strip 302 and strip 304 may be wiped clean, either after being removed or while being affixed to portion 110. Further, each of strip 302 and strip 304 may be removed and, thereafter, new strips may be positioned on device 100. With reference to FIGS. 6-8, which depict device 100 “in use” by a user 200, portion 110 is positioned adjacent to and in contact with a jaw 202 of user 200. Further, portion 130 is positioned adjacent to an in contact with a chest area of user 200. It is noted that it is noted required for either portion 110 or portion 130 to be in contact with the skin of a user. It is further noted that a position of device 200 relative to a user (e.g., user 200) may be adjusted based on a desire of user (e.g., for comfort). More specifically, a position of portion 110 and/or portion 130 relative to a user may be adjusted. FIG. 9 is another depiction of device 100. As illustrated in FIG. 9, a dimension D1 of first piece 122 may comprise, as a non-limiting example, 1.812 inches, and a dimension D2 of second piece 124 may comprise, as a non-limiting example, 2.306 inches. Further, a dimension D3, which extends from portion 130 to portion 110, may comprise, for example only, 6.060 inches. Further, an angle Θ2 (i.e., between an axis 402 extending through a corner of portion 120 (and parallel to a longitudinal axis of portion 130) and an axis 404 parallel to an surface of portion 110), may comprise, as a non-limiting example, 145 degrees. Further, with reference to FIG. 10, which is another depiction of device 100, a dimension D4 may comprise, for example only, 5.259 inches, a dimension D5 may comprise, for example only, 6.062 inches, a dimension D6 may comprise, for example only, 1.062 inches, and a dimension D7 may comprise, for example only, 4.134 inches. It is noted that the dimensions depicted and disclosed with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10 are provided only as examples, and the dimensions may vary in any suitable manner. As will be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art, a device 100 may be used as a traveler's aid (e.g., in a plane, train or automobile) for resting and sleeping. Device 100 may be used an alternative to a travel pillow and may be much easier to use and carry. Device 100 may also be used anywhere a user wants to catch some rest (e.g., emergency waiting room, church, at home watching television, etc.). Device 100, and more specifically, portion 110, may be configured to help keep a user's mouth in a substantially closed position (e.g., to prevent drooling). The user's head may stay upright, which may help prevent a kinked neck and/or infringement on fellow passengers (e.g., when the user's head leans too far to one side or the other). It is noted that in contrast to some conventional devices, device 100 does not require a back strap (i.e., a strap which wraps around a portion of a user's head).
