Substituted Indol-5-ol Derivatives and Their Therapeutic Applications PRIORITY CLAIM [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/852,309 (Filed on March 15, 2013), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates generally to the use of compounds to treat a variety of disorders, diseases and pathologic conditions and more specifically to the use of substituted indol-5-ol derivatives to modulate protein kinases and for treating protein kinase-mediated diseases. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell. Protein kinases, containing a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain, catalyze the phosphorylation of target protein substrates. [0004] The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates in the phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Tyrosine phosphorylation is a central event in the regulation of a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival. Several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases control these events by catalyzing the transfer of phosphate from ATP to a tyrosine residue of specific cell protein targets. Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families [ Hanks et al., FASEB J., (1995), 9, 576-596; Knighton et al., Science, (1991), 253, 407-414; Garcia-Bustos et al., ΕΜΒΟ J., (1994), 13:23 52-2361). Examples of kinases in the protein kinase family include, without limitation, abl, Akt, bcr-abl, Blk, Brk, Btk, c-kit, c-Met, c-src, c-fms, CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, CDK10, cRafl, CSF1R, CSK, EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, Erk, Fak, fes, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, Fgr, fit-1, Fps, Frk, Fyn, Hck, IGF-1R, INS-R, Jak, KDR, Lck, Lyn, ΜΕΚ, ρ38, PDGFR, PIK, PKC, ΡΥΚ2, ros, Tie, Tie-2, TRK, Yes, and Zap70. [0005] Studies indicated that protein kinases play a central role in the regulation and maintenance of a wide variety of cellular processes and cellular function. For example, kinase activity acts as molecular switches regulating cell proliferation, activation, and/or differentiation. Uncontrolled or excessive kinase activity has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferation disorders as well as diseases resulting from inappropriate activation of the immune system (autoimmune disorders), allograft rejection, and graft vs host disease. [0006] It is reported that many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases. In addition, endothelial cell specific receptor PTKs, such as VEGF-2 and Tie-2, mediate the angiogenic process and are involved in supporting the progression of cancers and other diseases involving uncontrolled vascularization. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents. [0007] Many cancers are characterized by disruptions in cellular signaling pathways that lead to uncontrolled growth and proliferation of cancerous cells. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a crucial role in these signaling pathways, transmitting extracellular molecular signals into cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a cell. RTKs are transmembrane proteins that generally include an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a membrane-spanning domain and a catalytic cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The binding of ligand to the extracellular potion is believed to promote dimerization, resulting in trans-phosphorylation and activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (Schlessinger et al. Neuron 1992; 9:383-391). [0008] Considering the lack of currently available treatment options for the majority of the conditions associated with protein kinases, there is still a great need for new therapeutic agents that inhibit these protein targets. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an antitumor agent comprising a substituted indol-5-ol derivative as described in formula (I), pharmaceutically-acceptable formulations thereof, methods for making novel compounds and compositions for using the compounds. The compounds and compositions comprising the compounds in formula (I) have utility in treatment of a variety of diseases. [0010] The combination therapy described herein may be provided by the preparation of the substituted indol-5-ol derivatives of formula (I) and the other therapeutic agent as separate pharmaceutical formulations followed by the administration thereof to a patient simultaneously, semi-simultaneously, separately or over regular intervals. [0011] The present invention provides methods of use for certain chemical compounds such as kinase inhibitors for treatment of various diseases, disorders, and pathologies, for example, cancer, and vascular disorders, such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or ischemia. The triazine compounds described in this invention may block the enzymatic activity of some or many of the members of the Aurora kinase family, in addition to blocking the activity of other receptor and non-receptor kinase. Such compounds may be beneficial for treatment of the diseases where disorders affect cell motility, adhesion, and cell cycle progression, and in addition, diseases with related hypoxic conditions, osteoporosis and conditions, which result from or are related to increases in vascular permeability, inflammation or respiratory distress, tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastases and apoptosis.

By way of example, a synthetic route similar to that shown in any of the following Schemes may be used, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Each variable in the following schemes refers to any group consistent with the description of the compounds provided herein. [0109] In the Schemes that follow the term "reduction" refers to the process of reducing a nitro functionality to an amino functionality, or the process of transforming an ester functionality to an alcohol. The reduction of a nitro group can be carried out in a number of ways well known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis including, but not limited to, catalytic hydrogenation, reduction with SnCl2 and reduction with titanium bichloride. In the Schemes that follow, the term "hydrolyze" refers to the reaction of a substrate or reactant with water. More specifically, "hydrolyze" refers to the conversion of an ester or nitrite functionality into a carboxylic acid. This process can be catalyzed by a variety of acids or bases well known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. [0110] The compounds of Formula (Ila, lib, and lie) may be prepared by use of known chemical reactions and procedures. The following general preparative methods are presented to aid one of skill in the art in synthesizing the inhibitors, with more detailed examples being presented in the experimental section describing the working examples. [0111] Propenyl-pyrazol amine as defined in formula (III) is not commercially available. It can be prepared by several methods as described earlier (see, e.g., U.S. provisional application number 61/555,738). [0112] Precursors of substituted indol-5-ol as defined in formula (IV) can be purchased from suppliers, or synthesized from commercially available precursors using established protocols. (WO 2004/009542, Ρ33-38; Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2006, Vol 49, No. 7, Ρ2143-2146; Org. Lett. Vol 10, No 12, 2008, Ρ 2369-2372; WO 00/47212, Ρ245-250; WO 2009036055 Al, Ρ57). [0113] Especially, precursor 4-7-d-fluoroindol-5-ol as defined in formula (IVa) was not reported before and can be prepared with the same token. [0114] For example, as illustrated in scheme 1, precursor (IV) can be prepared from the commercially available starting materials via several steps. Also various synthetic routs can be utilized to prepare the compound. [0116] The preparation of the compounds of formula (Ha, lib and lie) in this invention can be carried out by methods known in the art. [0117] As shown in scheme 2, the pyrimidine derivative (Ha) can be synthesized by the reaction of 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine, or 4,6-dichloro-2-(methylsulfonyl)pyrimidine, with a sequence of sustitutedidole-5-ol s to give dichloropyrimidine intermediate of compound b, which can react with WH to produce the advanced monochloro intermediate of compound c. The displacement of the last chlorine by RH can be achieved by increasing the temperature, affording the final compound (Ha). The reaction can be stepwise or in one pot. Alternative sequence can also be used to make pyrimidine derivatives. With the same token, Compound lib and lie can also be synthesized. [0119] The reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of an inert solvent. There is no particular restriction on the nature of the solvent to be employed, provided that it has no adverse effect on the reaction or on the reagents involved and that it can dissolve the reagents, at least to some extent. Examples of suitable solvents include: aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, heptane, ligroin and petroleum ether; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons, especially aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene and the dichlorobenzenes; esters, such as ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate and diethyl carbonate; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, isophorone and cyclohexanone; nitro compounds, which may be nitroalkanes or nitroaranes, such as nitroethane and nitrobenzene; nitriles, such as acetonitrile and isobutyronitrile; amides, which may be fatty acid amides, such as formamide, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and hexamethylphosphoric triamide; and sulphoxides, such as dimethyl sulphoxide and sulpholane.

Thus, tablets or pills may be coated with sugar, shellac, or other enteric coating agents. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active ingredients, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors. Materials used in preparing these various compositions should be pharmaceutically or veterinarally pure and non-toxic in the amounts used. [0127] For the purposes of parenteral therapeutic administration, the active ingredient may be incorporated into a solution or suspension.

EXAMPLES [0197] The invention further encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising any one or more of the compounds disclosed herein and said compounds in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, crystal forms and individual steroisomers thereof (e.g., diastereomers, enantiomer), and as in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. These include, but are not limited to, wherein the inventive compounds are formulated into a composition in a neutral or salt form. [0198] “Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such as organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups also can be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, and procaine and the like. [0199] “Salts” are chemical combinations of two ionizable components (e.g., when dissolved in water), one acidic and the other basic with respect to one another. If in a salt form, a drug can be either the acidic or the basic component. [0200] “Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” include any salt form of the compound wherein the salt is safe for animal ingestion (e.g., nontoxic to humans when taken orally). Exemplary such salts that can be used in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, 3-phenylpropionate, acetate, adipate, alginate, amsonate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, butyrate, calcium edetate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, camsylate, carbonate, citrate, clavulariate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, ethanesulfonate, finnarate, gluceptate, glucoheptanoate, gluconate, glutamate, glycerophosphate, glycollylarsanilate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexafluorophosphate, hexanoate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroiodide, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, laurylsulphonate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methanesulfonate, methylbromide, methylnitrate, methyl sulfate, mucate, naphthylate, napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine ammonium salt, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pantothenate, pectinate, persulfate, phosphate, phosphateldiphosphate, picrate, pivalate, polygalacturonate, propionate, p-toluenesulfonate, saccharate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, succinate, sulfate, sulfosaliculate, suramate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, thiocyanate, tosylate, triethiodide, undecanoate, and valerate salts, and the like (see also S.M. Berge et al., Pharmaceutical Salts, J. Pharm. Scis. , 1977, 66:1-18; P.L. Gould, Salt selection for basic drugs, Int'l J. PharmsA9&6, 33:201-17.) [0201] “Solvates” are compositions which, during the process of crystallization of a compound from solution, trap molecules of the solvent in the forming lattice. [0202] “Hydrates” are solvates wherein the solvent was water. [0203] “Crystal” forms are solid compositions wherein the molecules making up the composition are packed in a repeating lattice structure. When more than one lattice pattern is possible for compositions made up the same molecules, the different compositions are called “polymorphs.” [0204] “Diastereomers” are stereoisomers that are not related as object and mirror image, but still differ are in the arrangement in three-dimensional space about one tetrahedral, sp3-hybridized carbon. [0205] An “enantiomer” is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other, but are non-superposable (not identical). [0206] “Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is any excipient which is non-toxic and aids in a drug’s function (see also, Rowe RC et al., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 5th ed., 2006.) [0207] The following examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope. [0208] All experiments were performed under anhydrous conditions (i.e. dry solvents) in an atmosphere of argon, except where stated, using oven-dried apparatus and employing standard techniques in handling air-sensitive materials. Aqueous solutions of sodium bicarbonate (NaHC03) and sodium chloride (brine) were saturated. [0209] Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck Kiesel gel 60 F254 plates with visualization by ultraviolet and/or anisaldehyde, potassium permanganate or phosphomolybdic acid dips. [0210] NMR spectra: 1Η Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded at 400 MHz. Data are presented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, qn = quintet, dd = doublet of doublets, m = multiplet, bs = broad singlet), coupling constant (J/Hz) and integration. Coupling constants were taken and calculated directly from the spectra and are uncorrected. [0211] Low resolution mass spectra: Electrospray (ES+) ionization was used. The protonated parent ion (Μ+Η) or parent sodium ion (M+Na) or fragment of highest mass is quoted. Analytical gradient consisted of 10% ACN in water ramping up to 100% ACN over 5 minutes unless otherwise stated. [0212] High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was use to analyze the purity of triazine derivatives. HPLC was performed on a Phenomenex Synergi Polar-RP, 4u, 80Α, 150 χ 4.6 mm column using a vShimadzusystem equipped with SPD-M10A Phosphodiode Array Detector. Mobile phase A was water and mobile phase Β was acetonitrile with a gradient from 20% to 80% Β over 60 minutes and re-equilibrate at Α/Β (80:20) for 10 minutes. UV detection was at 220 and 54 nm. [0213] A 250 mL flask was charged with potassium tert-butoxide (5.75 g, 51.26 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (50 m L). The resulting suspension was cooled to 5-10 °C before ethyl acetoacetate (6.67 g, 51.26 mmol) was I added. The rate of addition was controlled so that the internal temperature of the reactor did not exceed 15 °C. The resulting mixture became homogeneous and was pale yellow in color. After addition was completed, the reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C and then 2,3,4,6-tetrafluoronitrobenzene (5.00g, 25.63 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (20 m L) was added. After addition was complete, the resulting brown reaction mixture was stirred at about 0°C (ice batch) for 30 min. 1 Ν HC1 were slowly added and the brown solution eventually became a clear yellow solution. The pH of the aqueous phase was pH 6. The mixture was I extracted with ethyl acetate (3 χ) and the combined organic extracts were washed with brine (50 mL) and concentrated in vacua to afford orange oil. [0214] The oil obtained above was charged into a 250 L round bottom flask and dissolved in glacial acetic acid (25 mL). Sulfuric acid (cone.,15 mL) was then added and a vigorous evolution of gas was observed in addition to a slight exotherm. Stirring was initiated and the reaction mixture was heated at 70 °C for 7 h, after which time TLC analysis indicated 100% conversion. The reaction mixture was cooled to between 15°C to 20 °C and ethyl acetate (200 mL) was added followed by the addition of water (100 mL). Sat. NaOH solution in water was added slowly to adjust the pH~7. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 χ 100 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed Example 1 with brine. The brown organic extracts were concentrated under reduced pressure to afford crude compound as brown oil. [0215] The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 0-30% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give the desired compound 3.00 g (, 50% yield, 1).

Example 128 [0278] This example tests the inhibitory properties of representative compounds of the invention in c-Src kinase, Aurora-A kinase, Flt3 kinase, Ret kinase and TrkA Kinase assays (see, Daniele Fancelli et al, J. Med. Chem., 2006, 49 (24), ρρ 7247-7251). The KinaseProfiler™ Service Assay Protocols (Millipore) was used to test the kinase inhibiting activity of novel compounds from this invention. To do this, the buffer composition was as: 20 mM MOPS, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35, 5% Glycerol, 0.1% β-mercaptοethanο 1, 1 mg/mL BSA. Test compounds were initially dissolved in DMSO at the desired concentration, then serially diluted to the kinase assay buffer. In a final reaction volume of 25 pL, Aurora-A(h) (5-10 mU) is incubated with 8 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 0.2 mM EDTA, 200 μΜ LRRASLG (Kemptide), 10 mM MgAcetate and [y33P-ATP], The reaction was initiated by the addition of the MgATP mix. After incubation for 40 minute at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by addition of 5 pL of a 3% phosphoric acid solution. 10 pL of the reaction was then spotted onto a Ρ30 filtermat and washed three times for 5 minutes in 50 mM phosphoric acid and once in methanol prior to drying and scintillation counting. Wells containing substrate but no kinase and wells containing a phosphopeptide control were used to set 0% and 100% phosphorylation value, repectively. [0279] The Kinase Hotspot SM kinase assay was also used to test the compounds for IC50 or % inhibitions (Reaction Biology Corp.). Inhibitory IC50 values were determined by titration of compound at the optimal kinase concentration (Kinase EC50).

Example 130 [0286] NTW-3475 was also tested for its antiproliferative potential using cell lines from the NCI 60 cancer cell line panel. [0287] The human tumor cell lines of the cancer screening panel are grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. For a typical screening experiment, cells are inoculated into 96 well microtiter plates in 100 μℓ, at plating densities ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 cells/well depending on the doubling time of individual cell lines. After cell inoculation, the microtiter plates are incubated at 37° C, 5 % C02, 95 % air and 100 % relative humidity for 24 h prior to addition of experimental drugs. [0288] After 24 h, two plates of each cell line are fixed in situ with TCA, to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Τζ). Experimental drugs are solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at 400-fold the desired final maximum test concentration and stored frozen prior to use. At the time of drug addition, an aliquot of frozen concentrate is thawed and diluted to twice the desired final maximum test concentration with complete medium containing 50 pg/ml gentamicin. Additional four, 10-fold or lA log serial dilutions are made to provide a total of five drug concentrations plus control. Aliquots of 100 μ1 of these different drug dilutions are added to the appropriate microtiter wells already containing 100 μ1 of medium, resulting in the required final drag concentrations. [0289] Following drag addition, the plates are incubated for an additional 48 h at 37°C, 5 % C02, 95 % air, and 100 % relative humidity. For adherent cells, the assay is tenninated by the addition of cold TCA. Cells are fixed in situ by the gentle addition of 50 μ1 of cold 50 % (w/v) TCA (final concentration, 10 % TCA) and incubated for 60 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant is discarded, and the plates are washed five times with tap water and air dried. Sulforhodamine Β (SRB) solution (100 μ1) at 0.4 % (w/v) in 1 % acetic acid is added to each well, and plates are incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye is removed by washing five times with 1 % acetic acid and the plates are air dried. Bound stain is subsequently solubilized with 10 mM trizma base, and the absorbance is read on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nm. For suspension cells, the methodology is the same except that the assay is terminated by fixing settled cells at the bottom of the wells by gently adding 50 μ1 of 80 % TCA (final concentration, 16 % TCA). Using the seven absorbance measurements [time zero, (Τζ), control growth, (C), and test growth in the presence of drug at the five concentration levels (Ti)], the percentage growth is calculated at each of the drug concentrations levels. Percentage growth inhibition is calculated as: [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] χ 100 for concentrations for which Ti>/=Tz [(Η-Τζ)/Τζ] χ 100 for concentrations for which Ti<Tz. [0290] Three dose response parameters are calculated for each experimental agent. Growth inhibition of 50 % (GI50) is calculated from [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] χ 100 = 50, which is the drug concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the net protein increase (as measured by SRB staining) in control cells during the drug incubation. [0291] As shown in FIG. 3 NTW-3475 demonstrated strong antiproliferative activity (shown by % of control) in at least 13 of the 16 cell lines studied. This antiproliferative effect was seen a range of cell lines including cell lines from Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, Thyroid, Endometrial, Gastric, Breast and Pancreatic Carcinomas. Example 131 [0292] This example assesses NTW-3475’s anti-tumor activity using a SCID mouse xenograft models for leukemias and nude mouse xenograft models of endometrial, pancreatic and thyroid carcinomas. NTW-3475 combination therapy was also studied in murine xenografts. [0293] The objective of the first study was to evaluate antitumor activities of the novel multiplekinase inhibitor NTW-3475 against human MV411 human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) xenograft model in female SCID mice. [0294] Four or six animals were randomly assigned to each study group. Each animal was injected subcutaneously in the left and right flank area with 0.1 ml of 1.0 χ 108 MV411 cells per mL. [0295] Each test or control animal was placed on a 5-day on, two-day off for two cycles of vehicle negative control or 25, 50 mg/kg of NTW-3475. Tumor growth was measured with a digital hand held caliper twice weekly (once tumor emerges) prior to the first dosing and then two to three times weekly until euthanized. Animals were weighed prior to tumor cell injection, prior to dosing, two to three times weekly with tumor growth measurements, and prior to euthanasia. [0296] The results are shown in FIGS. 4 (tumor weight over time), 5 (tumor volume over time), and 6 ( T/C at day 22). The results indicate that NTW-3475 has a strong anti-tumor effect against AML with minimal body weight lost. [0297] The objective of the second study was to evaluate antitumor activities of novel multiplekinase inhibitor NTW-3475 in human Κ562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) xenograft model in female SCID mice. [0298] Four to six animals were randomly assigned to study groups. Each animal was weighed, and then injected subcutaneously in the left and right flank area with 0.1 ml of 8.0 χ 107 Κ562 cells per mL. [0299] Each test or control animal was on a 5-day on, two-day off for two cycles treatment schedule. Tumor growth was measured with a digital hand held caliper twice weekly (once tumor emerges) prior to the first dosing and then two to three times weekly until euthanized. Animals were weighed prior to tumor cell injection, prior to dosing, two to three times weekly with tumor growth measurements, and prior to euthanasia. The results are shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. The results show that NTW-3475 has a strong anti-tumor effect against CML in this model system. [0300] The objective of the third study was to evaluate antitumor activities of novel multiplekinase inhibitor NTW-3475 in human MIAPaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma xenograft in athymic nude-Faxnl mice. [0301] Four animals were randomly assigned to study groups. Each animal was weighed, and then injected subcutaneously in the left and right flank area with 0.1 ml of 5.0 x 107 MIAPaCa-2 cells per mL. [0302] Each test or control animal was on a 5-day on, two-day off for two cycles treatment schedule with negative control vehicle, positive control Abraxane at 20 mg/kg or 25, 50 mg/kg of NTW-3475. Tumor growth was measured with a digital hand held caliper twice weekly (once tumor emerges) prior to the first dosing and then two to three times weekly until euthanized. The results are shown in FIGS. 9, 10 and 11 which indicate that NTW-3475 has a strong anti-tumor effect against pancreatic carcinoma cells in this model system. [0303] NTW-3475 was similarly tested and shown to have an anti-tumor effect in ΤΤ human Thyroid carcinoma xenograft (FIGs. 12 and 13). [0304] NTW-3475 was similarly tested and shown to have an anti-tumor effect in ΑΝ3 human endometrial carcinoma xenograft (FIGs. 14, 15, and 16). [0305] NTW-3475 was similarly tested alone and in combination with Abraxane and the combination shown to have an anti-tumor effect in MIAPaCa-2 xenograft (FIGs. 17, 18 and 19). [0306] Overall the kinase, proliferation, and xenografts studies indicate that NTW-3475 shows high cellular potency and targeting (FIG. 20) and NTW-3475 is active in vivo against AML, CML, thyroid, endometrial and some pancreatic carcinoma in xenograft model systems (FIG. 21). Example 132 [0307] The embodiment of the invention disclosed in Example 87 (Compound 87), (also refered to herein as compound “NTW-3456”) demonstrated strong inhibition of all the kinases in Example 128 and was chosen for further testing. [0308] The first study was designed to assess the effect of NTW-3456 on kinase activity. Activity of NTW-3456 for a wide range of kinases and is shown FIGS. 22-24, including mutant kinases thought to play a large role in neoplastic transformation (FIGs. 23 and 24). In addition, NTW-3456 inhibited kinase activity in abl mutants for which no prior inhibitors have been FDA approved. In particular, NTW-3456 inhibits the 2 T315I mutant for which no kinase inhibitor had been known prior to NTW-3456. Example 133 [0309] NTW-3456 was tested for its effect on in vitro proliferation using the protocol for the 60 NCI Cancer Cell Lines used to test NTW-3475. [0310] The NCI-60 DTP Human Tumor Cell Line Panel was used to further evaluate the biochemistry of NTW-3475 (see Shoemaker: The NCI60 human tumour cell line anticancer drug screen, Nature Reviews Cancer 6, 813-823 (1 October 2006)). The effect of NTW-3456 on kinase activity was tested for a wide range of kinases and is shown in FIG. 25. Overall, NTW-3456 inhibited both phosphorylation and proliferation. Anti-proliferative activity from NTW-3456 was seen against AML, CML, thyroid, enodmetrial, gastric, breast, and some pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (FIG. 26). Example 134 [0311] This example studies the anti-tumor activity of NTW-3456 in xenograft model systems for AML, CML, thyroid, endometrial, pancreatic carcinomas. [0312] Figures 27-32 depict the results of various concentrations of NTW-3456 on tumor growth in SCID mouse/xenograft model of AML using MV411 cells. In this model system, NTW-3456 demonstrates significant anti-tumor activity, especially at higher doses (FIGs. 29 and 32). This invention is characterized as it is here was a correlation between the inhibition of the pFLT3 kinase and growth control. [0313] The mice carrying the established MV4-11 tumor xenografts (tumor volume around 150 mm3) were given an oral dose of 50 mg/kg NTW-3456. At 0, 1, 2, 8, 16, 24 hours after dosing, three were euthanized. The blood samples were collected and plasma was prepared with centrifuge for LCMS assay. And the tumors were harvested, homogenized in lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLT3 antibody FIG. 33. [0314] The curve (solid dot) is the plot of plasma concentration-time profiles of NTW-3456 after oral administration of 50 mg/kg. The top curve (solid triangle) showed NTW-3456 inhibit FLT3 phosphorylation (pFLT3) of MV4-11 tumors after oral administration of 50 mg/kg NTW-3456 at indicated time. [0315] NTW-3456 inhibits FLT3 phosphorylation in vivo and it is time-dependent. After 24 hour, NTW-3456 (7 ηΜ in plasma) still inhibits more than 60% FLT3 phoseporylation of MV4-11 tumor. [0316] Figures 34 and 35 depict the results of various concentrations of NTW-3456 on a SCID mouse/xenograft model of CML using Κ562 cells. In this model system, NTW-3456 demonstrates significant anti-tumor activity, especially at higher doses (FIG. 34). [0317] Figures 36-38 depict the results of various concentrations of NTW-3456 on a nude mouse/xenograft the ΤΤ cell model of thyroid carcinoma. In this model system, NTW-3456 demonstrates significant anti-tumor activity, especially at higher doses (FIG. 38). [0318] Figures 39-41 depict the results of various concentrations of NTW-3456 on the ΑΝ3 nude mouse/xenograft model of endometrial carcinoma. In this model system, NTW-3456 demonstrates significant anti-tumor activity, especially at higher doses (FIG. 41). [0319] Figures 42-44 depict the results of various concentrations of NTW-3456 on a nude mouse/xenograft the MIAPaCa-2 model of pancreatic carcinoma. In this model system, NTW-3456 demonstrates some anti-tumor activity in this model of pancreatic carcinoma. [0320] Figures 45 and 46 depict the results of various concentrations of NTW-3456, with or without Abraxane on a MiaPaCa-2 model of pancreatic carcinoma. In this model system, NTW-3456 demonstrates significant anti-tumor activity, especially when used in combination with Abraxane (FIG. 47). [0321] Figures 48 and 49 depict the results of various concentrations of NTW-3456, with or without Abraxane on a Panc-1 model of pancreatic carcinoma. In this model system, NTW-3456 demonstrates significant anti-tumor activity, especially when used in combination with Abraxane [0322] Figure 50 summarizes NTW-3456’s anti-tumor activity in murine xenografts. Overall, these examples demonstrate the high specific activity seen with NTW-3456 Example 135 [0323] This example studies the biochemistry of NTW-3456 and NTW-3475 cells. [0324] Figure 51 and 52 show the dose response curves for the inhibition of proliferation and pERK and pAKt signaling in MiaPaCa-2 and BaFC3 cells by NTE-3456, Nilotinib, Ponatinnib, Suntinib, and Imatinib. FIG. 53 summarizes this data. [0325] Figure 54 shows the dose response curves for the inhibition of in vitro growth in Κ562 cells by NTE-3456, Nilotinib, Ponatinnib, Suntinib, and Imatinib. Figure 55 shows the dose response curves for the inhibition of p-Crl kinase activity in Κ562 cells by NTE-3456, Nilotinib, Ponatinnib, Suntinib, and Imatinib. FIG. 56 shows the dose response curves for the induction of Caspse 3/7 activity in Κ562 cells by NTE-3456, Nilotinib, Ponatinnib, Suntinib, and Imatinib. FIG. 57 summarizes this data. [0326] Figure 58 shows the dose response curve for the inhibition of kinase activity in BaF3 cells by NTW-3456 from FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. Figure 59 sets forth the NTW-3456 IC50 levels for FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 driven BaF3 cells. Overall, the inhibition of proliferation, pERK pathway signaling in MIaPaca-2 and BxPC3 cells by NTW-3475 (FIG. 38) and NTW-3456 (FIG. 39) are similar. Further, these results suggest a correlation between and growth inhibition and the signaling inhibition.

[0334] The NCI-60 DTP Human Tumor Cell Line Panel was used to further evaluate the biochemistry of Compound 53 (see Shoemaker: The NCI60 human tumour cell line anticancer drug screen, Nature Reviews Cancer 6, 813-823 (1 October 2006)). [0335] The human tumor cell lines of the cancer screening panel are grown in RPMI1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. For a typical screening experiment, cells are inoculated into 96 well microtiter plates in 100 pL at plating densities ranging from 5,000 to 40,000 cells/well depending on the doubling time of individual cell lines. After cell inoculation, the microtiter plates are incubated at 37° C, 5 % C02, 95 % air and 100 % relative humidity for 24 h prior to addition of experimental drugs. [0336] After 24 h, two plates of each cell line are fixed in situ with TCA, to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Τζ). Experimental drugs are solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at 400-fold the desired final maximum test concentration and stored frozen prior to use. At the time of drug addition, an aliquot of frozen concentrate is thawed and diluted to twice the desired final maximum test concentration with complete medium containing 50 pg/ml gentamicin. Additional four, 10-fold or Vi log serial dilutions are made to provide a total of five drug concentrations plus control. Aliquots of 100 μ1 of these different drug dilutions are added to the appropriate microtiter wells already containing 100 μ1 of medium, resulting in the required final drug concentrations. [0337] Following drug addition, the plates are incubated for an additional 48 h at 37°C, 5 % C02, 95 % air, and 100 % relative humidity. For adherent cells, the assay is terminated by the addition of cold TCA. Cells are fixed in situ by the gentle addition of 50 μ1 of cold 50 % (w/v) TCA (final concentration, 10 % TCA) and incubated for 60 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant is discarded, and the plates are washed five times with tap water and air dried. Sulforhodamine Β (SRB) solution (100 μ1) at 0.4 % (w/v) in 1 % acetic acid is added to each well, and plates are incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye is removed by washing five times with 1 % acetic acid and the plates are air dried. Bound stain is subsequently solubilized with 10 mM trizma base, and the absorbance is read on an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nm. For suspension cells, the methodology is the same except that the assay is terminated by fixing settled cells at the bottom of the wells by gently adding 50 μ1 of 80 % TCA (final concentration, 16 % TCA). Using the seven absorbance measurements [time zero, (Τζ), control growth, (C), and test growth in the presence of drug at the five concentration levels (Ti)], the percentage growth is calculated at each of the drug concentrations levels. Percentage growth inhibition is calculated as: [0338] [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] χ 100 for concentrations for which Ti>/=Tz [0339] [(Ti-Tz)/Tz] χ 100 for concentrations for which Ti<Tz. [0340] Three dose response parameters are calculated for each experimental agent. Growth inhibition of 50 % (GI50) is calculated from [(Ti-Tz)/(C-Tz)] χ 100 = 50, which is the drug concentration resulting in a 50% reduction in the net protein increase (as measured by SRB staining) in control cells during the drug incubation. [0341] As shown in Table 6, Compound 53 demonstrated the growth inhibition (GI50) ranging from 0.01 to 1.89 μΜ. [0342] Table 6 In-Vitro Testing Results for Compound 53.

Example 139 [0344] This example illustrated the proliferating cell growth inhibition of selected compounds from this invention. To do this, the cells were seeded into fresh Iscove’s growth medium at a density of 0.4℮6 cells/ml and grown in log phase for 24hr. Cells were then resuspended in their fresh respective growth media at O.le6 cells/ml and plated into 384 well black, clear-bottom microplates at 36ul/well. Test compounds and controls were initially dissolved in DMSO at the desired concentration, then serially diluted to the assay buffer. These solutions were added and cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37°C. CellTiterBlue (Promega cat# G7572) was added on the Beckman FX. Plates were returned to the 37°C CO2 incubator for 4 hr and then fluorescence was determined on the Victor plate reader. Data were processed using Microsoft Excel, and GI50 values were generated using Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). [0345] Table 7 shows representative GI50 data for the cell growth inhibition of Κ562, ΤΤ, KU812, MV4.11, RS4.11, AN3.CA and Kato III proliferations.

[0347] Four to six animals were randomly assigned to study groups. Each animal was weighed, and then injected subcutaneously in the left and right flank area with 0.1 ml of 8.0 χ 107 Κ562 cells per mL. [0348] Each test or control animal was on a 5-day on, two-day off for two cycles treatment schedule. Tumor growth was measured with a digital hand held caliper twice weekly (once tumor emerges) prior to the first dosing and then two to three times weekly until euthanized. Animals were weighed prior to tumor cell injection, prior to dosing, two to three times weekly with tumor growth measurements, and prior to euthanasia. The results are shown in FIGS. 60 to 63. The results show that Compound 10 and 11 have a strong anti-tumor effect against CML in this model system and no body weight lost. [0349] On the appropriate days, each animal in an appropriate group will receive a specific amount of test article either at 75 or 100 mg/kg, and the dosing volume is 1 Oml/kg by oral gavage as indicated. Dosing schedule will be once daily for 10 days (qd xlO, 5 days on and 2 days off for 2 cycles). [0350] Compound 53 was similarly tested and shown to have an anti-tumor effect in the in Κ562 Fluman Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Xenograft model in mice (Figure 64). Example 141 [0351] This example assesses Compound 10, 53 and 88’s anti-tumor activity using a SCID mouse xenograft models for ΤΤ human Thyroid carcinoma xenograft (FIGs. 65 to 69.) [0352] Compound 10 was tested and shown to have an anti-tumor effect in ΤΤ human Thyroid carcinoma xenograft (FIGs. 65 and 66). On the appropriate days, each animal in an appropriate group will receive a specific amount of Compound 10 either at 50 or 100 mg/kg, and the dosing volume is 1 Oml/kg by oral gavage as indicated. Dosing schedule will be once daily for 30 days. [0353] On the appropriate days, each animal in an appropriate group will receive a specific amount of Compound 53 either at 50 or 100 mg/kg, and the dosing volume is 1 Oml/kg by oral gavage as indicated. Dosing schedule will be once daily for 30 days. [0354] On the appropriate days, each animal in an appropriate group will receive a specific amount of Compound 88 either at 50 mg/kg, and the dosing volume is 1 Oml/kg by oral gavage as indicated. Dosing schedule will be once daily for 30 days. Example 142 [0355] The objective of the first study was to evaluate antitumor activities of the novel multiplekinase inhibitor Compounds 11, 68, and 82 against human MV411 human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) xenograft model in female SCID mice. [0356] Four or six animals were randomly assigned to each study group. Each animal was injected subcutaneously in the left and right flank area with 0.1 ml of 1.0 χ 108 MV411 cells per mL. [0357] Each test or control animal was placed on a 5-day on, two-day off for two cycles of vehicle negative control or 25, 50 mg/kg of compound. Tumor growth was measured with a digital hand held caliper twice weekly (once tumor emerges) prior to the first dosing and then two to three times weekly until euthanized. Animals were weighed prior to tumor cell injection, prior to dosing, two to three times weekly with tumor growth measurements, and prior to euthanasia. [0358] The results are shown in FIGS. 70-71. The results indicate that Compounds 11, 68 and 82 have a strong anti-tumor effect against AML with minimal body weight lost. Example 143 [0359] The objective of the third study was to evaluate antitumor activities of novel multiplekinase inhibitor Compound 10, 11, 12, 53, 68, 82, 83, 88, and 90 in human MIAPaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma xenograft in athymic nude-Faxnl mice. [0360] Four animals were randomly assigned to study groups. Each animal was weighed, and then injected subcutaneously in the left and right flank area with 0.1 ml of 5.0 χ 107 MIAPaCa-2 cells per mL. [0361] Each test or control animal was on a 5-day on, two-day off for three cycles treatment schedule with negative control vehicle or 40 mg/kg of Compound 10, 11,12, 53, 68, 82, 83, 88 and 90. Tumor growth was measured with a digital hand held caliper twice weekly (once tumor emerges) prior to the first dosing and then two to three times weekly until euthanized. [0362] The results are shown in FIGS. 72, 73, and 74 which indicate that Compounds 10, 11, 12, 53, 68, 82, 83, 88, and 90 have a strong anti-tumor effect against pancreatic carcinoma cells in this model system. The combination of Compounds 68 and 82 with Abraxane showed significant antitumor efficacy. Example 144 [0363] The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of Compound 53 has been studied using U251 human CNS tumor xenograft model in nude mice (Fig 16). This was a subcutaneous early stage experiment (defined as a median tumor staging size less than 200 mg). Compound 53 or vehicle control was administered by Intraperitoneal injection for various days with different doses. Compound 53 showed significant antitumor activities at dose of 60 mg/kg with the value of treat/control (T/C), 40% on day 30 when used dosing schedule of Q2Dx3. Compound 53 was well tolerated at this doses with maximum body weight lose 3.4%. Example 145 [0364] The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of Compound 53 has been studied using SC LOX IMVI Melanoma Xenografts model in nude mice (Fig 76). This was a subcutaneous early stage experiment (defined as a median tumor staging size less than 200 mg). Compound 53 or vehicle control was administered by Intraperitoneal injection for various days with different doses. Compound 53 showed significant antitumor activities at dose of 50 mg/kg with the value of treat/control (T/C), 21% on day 13 when used dosing schedule of QDx4. Compound 53 was well tolerated at this doses with maximum body weight lose 10.3%.
