To a solution of 6-(trifluoromethyl) pyrimidin-4-amine (1.0 g, 6.2 mmol) in DMF (30 mL) was added NBS (1.2 g, 6.8 mmol). The mixture was heated to 70° C. for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt, diluted with H2O, and extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine; dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was triturated in DCM to obtain title compound as white solid (1.38 g, 93%).
