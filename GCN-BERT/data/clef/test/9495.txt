Synthesis of Compound 1-5
1.02 g (yield=19%) of Compound 1-5 was synthesized in the same manner as in Synthesis of Compound 1-6 of Synthesis Example 1, except that Intermediate 1-5(2) was used instead of Intermediate 1-6(2). The obtained Compound 1-5 was identified by 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) and FAB-MS.
