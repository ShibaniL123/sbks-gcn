19-NOR C3,3-DISUBSTITUTED C21-N-PYRAZOLYL STEROIDS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF Background of the Invention Brain excitability is defined as the level of arousal of an animal, a continuum that ranges from coma to convulsions, and is regulated by various neurotransmitters. In general, neurotransmitters are responsible for regulating the conductance of ions across neuronal membranes. At rest, the neuronal membrane possesses a potential (or membrane voltage) of approximately -70 mV, the cell interior being negative with respect to the cell exterior. The potential (voltage) is the result of ion (K+, Na+, Cl', organic anions) balance across the neuronal semipermeable membrane. Neurotransmitters are stored in presynaptic vesicles and are released under the influence of neuronal action potentials. When released into the synaptic cleft, an excitatory chemical transmitter such as acetylcholine will cause membrane depolarization (change of potential from 70 mV to -50 mV). This effect is mediated by postsynaptic nicotinic receptors which are stimulated by acetylcholine to increase membrane permeability to Na+ ions. The reduced membrane potential stimulates neuronal excitability in the form of a postsynaptic action potential. In the case of the GABA receptor complex (GRC), the effect on brain excitability is mediated by GABA, a neurotransmitter. GABA has a profound influence on overall brain excitability because up to 40% of the neurons in the brain utilize GABA as a neurotransmitter. GABA regulates the excitability of individual neurons by regulating the conductance of chloride ions across the neuronal membrane. GABA interacts with its recognition site on the GRC to facilitate the flow of chloride ions down an electrochemical gradient of the GRC into the cell. An intracellular increase in the levels of this anion causes hyperpolarization of the transmembrane potential, rendering the neuron less susceptible to excitatory inputs (i.e., reduced neuron excitability). In other words, the higher the chloride ion concentration in the neuron, the lower the brain excitability (the level of arousal). It is well-documented that the GRC is responsible for the mediation of anxiety, seizure activity, and sedation. Thus, GABA and drugs that act like GABA or facilitate the effects of GABA (e.g., the therapeutically useful barbiturates and benzodiazepines (BZs), such as Valium®) produce their therapeutically useful effects by interacting with specific regulatory sites on the GRC. Accumulated evidence has now indicated that in addition to the benzodiazepine and barbiturate binding site, the GRC contains a distinct site for neuroactive steroids (Lan, Ν. C. et αℓ., Neurochem. Res. 16:347-356 (1991)). Neuroactive steroids can occur endogenously. The most potent endogenous neuroactive steroids are 3a-hydroxy-5-reduced pregnan-20-one and 3a-21-dihydroxy-5-reduced pregnan-20-one, metabolites of hormonal steroids progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, respectively. The ability of these steroid metabolites to alter brain excitability was recognized in 1986 (Majewska, Μ. D. et αℓ., Science 232:1004-1007 (1986); Harrison, Ν. L. etal., JPharmacol. Exp. Ther. 241:346-353 (1987)). The ovarian hormone progesterone and its metabolites have been demonstrated to have profound effects on brain excitability (Backstrom, Τ. et αℓ., Acta Obstet. Gynecol. Scand. Suppl. 130:19-24 (1985); Pfaff, D.W and McEwen, Β. S., Science 219:808-814 (1983); Gyermek et αℓ., J Med Chem. 11: 117 (1968); Lambert, J. etal., Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 8:224-227 (1987)). The levels of progesterone and its metabolites vary with the phases of the menstrual cycle. It has been well documented that the levels of progesterone and its metabolites decrease prior to the onset of menses. The monthly recurrence of certain physical symptoms prior to the onset of menses has also been well documented. These symptoms, which have become associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), include stress, anxiety, and migraine headaches (Dalton, Κ., Premenstrual Syndrome and Progesterone Therapy, 2nd edition, Chicago Yearbook, Chicago (1984)). Subjects with PMS have a monthly recurrence of symptoms that are present in premenses and absent in postmenses. In a similar fashion, a reduction in progesterone has also been temporally correlated with an increase in seizure frequency in female epileptics, i.e., catamenial epilepsy (Laidlaw, J., Lancet, 1235-1237 (1956)). A more direct correlation has been observed with a reduction in progesterone metabolites (Rosciszewska et αℓ., J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. 49:47-51 (1986)). In addition, for subjects with primary generalized petit mal epilepsy, the temporal incidence of seizures has been correlated with the incidence of the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (Backstrom, Τ. et αℓ., J. Psychosom. Obstet. Gynaecol. 2:8-20 (1983)). The steroid deoxycorticosterone has been found to be effective in treating subjects with epileptic spells correlated with their menstrual cycles (Aird, RB. and Gordan, G., J. Amer. Med. Soc. 145:715-719 (1951)). A syndrome also related to low progesterone levels is postnatal depression (PND). Immediately after birth, progesterone levels decrease dramatically leading to the onset of PND. The symptoms of PND range from mild depression to psychosis requiring hospitalization. PND is also associated with severe anxiety and irritability. PND-associated depression is not amenable to treatment by classic antidepressants, and women experiencing PND show an increased incidence of PMS (Dalton, Κ., Premenstrual Syndrome and Progesterone Therapy, 2nd edition, Chicago Yearbook, Chicago (1984)). Collectively, these observations imply a crucial role for progesterone and deoxycorticosterone and more specifically their metabolites in the homeostatic regulation of brain excitability, which is manifested as an increase in seizure activity or symptoms associated with catamenial epilepsy, PMS, and PND. The correlation between reduced levels of progesterone and the symptoms associated with PMS, PND, and catamenial epilepsy (Backstrom, Τ. etal., JPsychosom.Obstet. Gynaecol. 2:8-20 (1983)); Dalton, Κ., Premenstrual Syndrome and Progesterone Therapy, 2nd edition, Chicago Yearbook, Chicago (1984)) has prompted the use of progesterone in their treatment (Mattson etal., “Medroxyprogesterone therapy of catamenial epilepsy,” in Advances in Epileptology: XVth Epilepsy International Symposium, Raven Press, New York (1984), ρρ. 279-282, and Dalton, Κ., Premenstrual Syndrome and Progesterone Therapy, 2nd edition, Chicago Yearbook, Chicago (1984)). However, progesterone is not consistently effective in the treatment of the aforementioned syndromes. For example, no dose-response relationship exists for progesterone in the treatment of PMS (Maddocks etal., Obstet. Gynecol. 154:573-581 (1986); Dennerstein et αℓ., Brit. Med J 290:16-17 (1986)). New and improved neuroactive steroids are needed that act as modulating agents for brain excitability, as well as agents for the prevention and treatment of CNS-related diseases. The compounds, compositions, and methods described herein are directed toward this end. Summary of the Invention The present invention is based, in part, on the desire to provide novel 19-nor (i.e., C19 desmethyl) compounds, e.g., related to progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, and their metabolites, with good potency, pharmacokinetic (ΡΚ) properties, oral bioavailability, formulatability, stability, safety, clearance and/or metabolism. One key feature of the compounds as described herein is disubstitution at the C3 position (e.g., with one substituent being a 3α hydroxy moiety. The inventors envision disubstitution at C-3 will eliminate the potential for oxidation of the hydroxy moiety to the ketone, prevent further metabolism, and reduce the potential for secondary elimination pathways, such as glucuronidation. The inventors further envision the overall effect of C3 disubstitution should be of improving the overall ΡΚ parameters and reducing potential toxicities and side effects, which may allow, in certain embodiments, administration orally and/or chronically. Another key feature of the compounds as described herein is the presence of a hydrogen at the Cl9 position (“19-nor”) rather than a methyl group. The inventors envision 19-nor compounds, as compared to their Cl 9-methyl counterparts, will have improved physical properties, such as improved solubility. The inventors envision futher enhancement of solubility, for example, when the ΑΒ ring system is in the cis configuration.

In certain embodiments, the subject is a human. In certain embodiments, the subject is a non-human animal. The terms “human,” “patient,” and “subject” are used interchangeably herein. Disease, disorder, and condition are used interchangeably herein. As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms “treat,” “treating” and “treatment” contemplate an action that occurs while a subject is suffering from the specified disease, disorder or condition, which reduces the severity of the disease, disorder or condition, or retards or slows the progression of the disease, disorder or condition (“therapeutic treatment”), and also contemplates an action that occurs before a subject begins to suffer from the specified disease, disorder or condition (“prophylactic treatment”). In general, the “effective amount” of a compound refers to an amount sufficient to elicit the desired biological response. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in this art, the effective amount of a compound of the invention may vary depending on such factors as the desired biological endpoint, the pharmacokinetics of the compound, the disease being treated, the mode of administration, and the age, health, and condition of the subject An effective amount encompasses therapeutic and prophylactic treatment. As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of a disease, disorder or condition, or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms associated with the disease, disorder or condition. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of the disease, disorder or condition. The term “therapeutically effective amount” can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of disease or condition, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent. As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a “prophylactically effective amount” of a compound is an amount sufficient to prevent a disease, disorder or condition, or one or more symptoms associated with the disease, disorder or condition, or prevent its recurrence. A prophylactically effective amount of a compound means an amount of a therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other agents, which provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of the disease, disorder or condition.

Pharmaceutical Compositions In another aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention (also referred to as the “active ingredient”) and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an effective amount of the active ingredient. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of the active ingredient. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a prophylactically effective amount of the active ingredient. The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be administered by a variety of routes including, but not limited to, oral (enteral) administration, parenteral (by injection) administration, rectal administration, transdermal administration, intradermal administration, intrathecal administration, subcutaneous (SC) administration, intravenous (IV) administration, intramuscular (IM) administration, and intranasal administration. Generally, the compounds provided herein are administered in an effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient’s symptoms, and the like. When used to prevent the onset of a CNS-disorder, the compounds provided herein will be administered to a subject at risk for developing the condition, typically on the advice and under the supervision of a physician, at the dosage levels described above. Subjects at risk for developing a particular condition generally include those that have a family history of the condition, or those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly susceptible to developing the condition. The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can also be administered chronically (“chronic administration”). Chronic administration refers to administration of a compound or pharmaceutical composition thereof over an extended period of time, e.g., for example, over 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, etc, or may be continued indefinitely, for example, for the rest of the subject’s life. In certain embodiments, the chronic administration is intended to provide a constant level of the compound in the blood, e.g., within the therapeutic window over the extended period of time. The pharmaceutical compostions of the present invention may be further delivered using a variety of dosing methods. For example, in certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be given as a bolus, e.g., in order to raise the concentration of the compound in the blood to an effective level. The placement of the bolus dose depends on the systemic levels of the active ingredient desired throughout the body, e.g., an intramuscular or subcutaneous bolus dose allows a slow release of the active ingredient, while a bolus delivered directly to the veins (e.g., through an IV drip) allows a much faster delivery which quickly raises the concentration of the active ingredient in the blood to an effective level. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be administered as a continuous infusion, e.g., by IV drip, to provide maintenance of a steady-state concentration of the active ingredient in the subject’s body. Furthermore, in still yet other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be administered as first as a bolus dose, followed by continuous infusion. The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the compound is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or excipients and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form. With oral dosing, one to five and especially two to four and typically three oral doses per day are representative regimens. Using these dosing patterns, each dose provides from about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg of the compound provided herein, with preferred doses each providing from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg, and especially about 1 to about 5 mg/kg. Transdermal doses are generally selected to provide similar or lower blood levels than are achieved using injection doses, generally in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight, and more preferably from about 0.5 to about 15% by weight. Injection dose levels range from about 0.1 mg/kg/hour to at least 10 mg/kg/hour, all for from about 1 to about 120 hours and especially 24 to 96 hours. A preloading bolus of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg or more may also be administered to achieve adequate steady state levels. The maximum total dose is not expected to exceed about 2 g/day for a 40 to 80 kg human patient. Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. Injectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable excipients known in the art. As before, the active compound in such compositions is typically a minor component, often being from about 0.05 to 10% by weight with the remainder being the injectable excipient and the like. Transdermal compositions are typically formulated as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s). When formulated as a ointment, the active ingredients will typically be combined with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with, for example an oil-in-water cream base. Such transdermal formulations are well-known in the art and generally include additional ingredients to enhance the dermal penetration of stability of the active ingredients or Formulation. All such known transdermal formulations and ingredients are included within the scope provided herein. The compounds provided herein can also be administered by a transdermal device. Accordingly, transdermal administration can be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir or porous membrane type, or of a solid matrix variety. The above-described components for orally administrable, injectable or topically administrable compositions are merely representative. Other materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set forth in Part 8 of Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition, 1985, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, which is incorporated herein by reference. The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences. The present invention also relates to the pharmaceutically acceptable formulations of a compound of the present invention. In one embodiment, the formulation comprises water. In another embodiment, the formulation comprises a cyclodextrin derivative. The most common cyclodextrins are α-, β- and γ- cyclodextrins consisting of 6, 7 and 8 α-1,4-linked glucose units, respectively, optionally comprising one or more substituents on the linked sugar moieties, which include, but are not limited to, methylated, hydroxyalkylated, acylated, and sulfoalkylether substitution. In certain embodiments, the cyclodextrin is a sulfoalkyl ether P-cyclodextrin, e.g., for example, sulfobutyl ether P-cyclodextrin, also known as Captisol®. See, e.g., U.S. 5,376,645. In certain embodiments, the formulation comprises hexapropyl-P-cyclodextrin (e.g., 10-50% in water). The present invention also relates to the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of a compound of the present invention. The acid which may be used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is that which forms a non-toxic acid addition salt, i.e., a salt containing pharmacologically acceptable anions such as the hydrochloride, hydroiodide, hydrobromide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, benzoate, para-toluenesulfonate, and the like.

Methods of Use and Treatment As generally described herein, the present invention is directed to C21 -substituted neuroactive steroids designed, for example, to act as GABA modulators. In certain embodiments, such compounds are envisioned to be useful as therapeutic agents for the inducement of anesthesia and/or sedation in a subject. In some embodiments, such compounds are envisioned to be useful as therapeutic agents for treating a CNS-related disorder (e.g., sleep disorder, a mood disorder, a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, a convulsive disorder, a disorder of memory and/or cognition, a movement disorder, a personality disorder, autism spectrum disorder, pain, traumatic brain injury, a vascular disease, a substance abuse disorder and/or withdrawal syndrome, or tinnitus) in a subject in need (e.g., a subject with Rett syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, or Angelman syndrome). Thus, in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of inducing sedation and/or anesthesia in a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of the present invention or a composition thereof. In certain embodiments, the compound is administered by intravenous administration. Earlier studies (see, e.g., Gee et αℓ., European Journal of Pharmacology, 136:419-423 (1987)) demonstrated that certain 3a-hydroxylated steroids are orders of magnitude more potent as modulators of the GABA receptor complex (GRC) than others had reported (see, e.g., Majewska et αℓ., Science 232:1004-1007 (1986); Harrison etal., JPharmacol. Exp. Ther. 241:346-353 (1987)). Majewska et αℓ. and Harrison et αℓ. taught that 3a-hydroxylated-5-reduced steroids are only capable of much lower levels of effectiveness. In vitro and in vivo experimental data have now demonstrated that the high potency of these steroids allows them to be therapeutically useful in the modulation of brain excitability via the GRC (see, e.g, Gee etal., European Journal of Pharmacology, 136:419-423 (1987); Wieland etal., Psychopharmacology 118(1):65-71 (1995)). Various synthetic steroids have also been prepared as neuroactive steroids. See, for example, U.S. Patent 5,232,917, which discloses neuroactive steroid compounds useful in treating stress, anxiety, insomnia, seizure disorders, and mood disorders, that are amenable to GRC-active agents, such as depression, in a therapeutically beneficial manner. Furthermore, it has been previously demonstrated that these steroids interact at a unique site on the GRC which is distinct from other known sites of interaction (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and GABA) where therapeutically beneficial effects on stress, anxiety, sleep, mood disorders and seizure disorders have been previously elicited (see, e.g., Gee, K.W. and Yamamura, H.I., “Benzodiazepines and Barbiturates: Drugs for the Treatment of Anxiety, Insomnia and Seizure Disorders,” in Central Nervous System Disorders, Horvell, ed., Marcel-Dekker, New York (1985), ρρ. 123-147; Lloyd, K.G. and Morselli, P.L., “Psychopharmacology of GABAergic Drugs,” in Psychopharmacology: The Third Generation of Progress, Η.Υ. Meltzer, ed., Raven Press, Ν.Υ. (1987), ρρ. 183-195; and Gee etal., European Journal of Pharmacology, 136:419-423 (1987). These compounds are desirable for their duration, potency, and oral activity (along with other forms of administration). Compounds of the present invention, as described herein, are generally designed to modulate GABA function, and therefore to act as neuroactive steroids for the treatment and prevention of CNS-related conditions in a subject. Modulation, as used herein, refers to the inhibition or potentiation of GABA receptor function. Accordingly, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions provided herein find use as therapeutics for preventing and/or treating CNS conditions in mammals including humans and non-human mammals. Thus, and as stated earlier, the present invention includes within its scope, and extends to, the recited methods of treatment, as well as to the compounds for such methods, and to the use of such compounds for the preparation of medicaments useful for such methods. Exemplary CNS conditions related to GABA-modulation include, but are not limited to, sleep disorders [e.g., insomnia], mood disorders [e.g., depression, dysthymic disorder (e.g., mild depression), bipolar disorder (e.g., I and/or II), anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder), stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compulsive disorders (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD))], schizophrenia spectrum disorders [e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder], convulsive disorders [e.g., epilepsy (e.g., status epilepticus (SE)), seizures], disorders of memory and/or cognition [e.g., attention disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)), dementia (e.g., Alzheimer’s type dementia, Lewis body type dementia, vascular type dementia], movement disorders [e.g., Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease], personality disorders [e.g., anti-social personality disorder, obsessive compulsive personality disorder], autism spectrum disorders (ASD) [e.g., autism, monogenetic causes of autism such as synaptophathy’s, e.g., Rett syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Angelman syndrome], pain [e.g., neuropathic pain, injury related pain syndromes, acute pain, chronic pain], traumatic brain injury (TBI), vascular diseases [e.g., stroke, ischemia, vascular malformations], substance abuse disorders and/or withdrawal syndromes [e.g., addition to opiates, cocaine, and/or alcohol], and tinnitus.

In certain embodiments, the attention disorder is ADHD. In certain embodiments, the compound is administered to the subject chronically. In certain embodiments, the compound is administered to the subject orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Anesthesia / Sedation Anesthesia is a pharmacologically induced and reversible state of amnesia, analgesia, loss of responsiveness, loss of skeletal muscle reflexes, decreased stress response, or all of these simultaneously. These effects can be obtained from a single drug which alone provides the correct combination of effects, or occasionally with a combination of drugs (e.g., hypnotics, sedatives, paralytics, analgesics) to achieve very specific combinations of results. Anesthesia allows patients to undergo surgery and other procedures without the distress and pain they would otherwise experience. Sedation is the reduction of irritability or agitation by administration of a pharmacological agent, generally to facilitate a medical procedure or diagnostic procedure. Sedation and analgesia include a continuum of states of consciousness ranging from minimal sedation (anxiolysis) to general anesthesia. Minimal sedation is also known as anxiolysis. Minimal sedation is a drug-induced state during which the patient responds normally to verbal commands. Cognitive function and coordination may be impaired. Ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are typically unaffected. Moderate sedation/analgesia (conscious sedation) is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which the patient responds purposefully to verbal command, either alone or accompanied by light tactile stimulation. No interventions are usually necessary to maintain a patent airway. Spontaneous ventilation is typically adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. Deep sedation/analgesia is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which the patient cannot be easily aroused, but responds purposefully (not a reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus) following repeated or painful stimulation. Independent ventilatory function may be impaired and the patient may require assistance to maintain a patent airway. Spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained. General anesthesia is a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which the patient is not arousable, even to painful stimuli. The ability to maintain independent ventilatory function is often impaired and assistance is often required to maintain a patent airway. Positive pressure ventilation may be required due to depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired. Sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) allows the depression of patients' awareness of the environment and reduction of their response to external stimulation. It can play a role in the care of the critically ill patient, and encompasses a wide spectrum of symptom control that will vary between patients, and among individuals throughout the course of their illnesses. Heavy sedation in critical care has been used to facilitate endotracheal tube tolerance and ventilator synchronization, often with neuromuscular blocking agents. In some embodiments, sedation (e.g., long-term sedation, continuous sedation) is induced and maintained in the ICU for a prolonged period of time (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 week, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months). Long-term sedation agents may have long duration of action. Sedation agents in the ICU may have short elimination half-life. Procedural sedation and analgesia, also referred to as conscious sedation, is a technique of administering sedatives or dissociative agents with or without analgesics to induce a state that allows a subject to tolerate unpleasant procedures while maintaining cardiorespiratory function. Anxiety Disorders Anxiety disorder is a blanket term covering several different forms of abnormal and pathological fear and anxiety. Current psychiatric diagnostic criteria recognize a wide variety of anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is a common chronic disorder characterized by long-lasting anxiety that is not focused on any one object or situation. Those suffering from generalized anxiety experience non-specific persistent fear and worry and become overly concerned with everyday matters. Generalized anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder to affect older adults. In panic disorder, a person suffers from brief attacks of intense terror and apprehension, often marked by trembling, shaking, confusion, dizziness, nausea, difficulty breathing. These panic attacks, defined by the ΑΡΑ as fear or discomfort that abruptly arises and peaks in less than ten minutes, can last for several hours and can be triggered by stress, fear, or even exercise; although the specific cause is not always apparent. In addition to recurrent unexpected panic attacks, a diagnosis of panic disorder also requires that said attacks have chronic consequences: either worry over the attacks' potential implications, persistent fear of future attacks, or significant changes in behavior related to the attacks. Accordingly, those suffering from panic disorder experience symptoms even outside of specific panic episodes. Often, normal changes in heartbeat are noticed by a panic sufferer, leading them to think something is wrong with their heart or they are about to have another panic attack. In some cases, a heightened awareness (hypervigilance) of body functioning occurs during panic attacks, wherein any perceived physiological change is interpreted as a possible life threatening illness (i.e. extreme hypochondriasis). Obsessive compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder primarily characterized by repetitive obsessions (distressing, persistent, and intrusive thoughts or images) and compulsions (urges to perform specific acts or rituals). The OCD thought pattern may be likened to superstitions insofar as it involves a belief in a causative relationship where, in reality, one does not exist. Often the process is entirely illogical; for example, the compulsion of walking in a certain pattern may be employed to alleviate the obsession of impending harm. And in many cases, the compulsion is entirely inexplicable, simply an urge to complete a ritual triggered by nervousness. In a minority of cases, sufferers of OCD may only experience obsessions, with no overt compulsions; a much smaller number of sufferers experience only compulsions. The single largest category of anxiety disorders is that of Phobia, which includes all cases in which fear and anxiety is triggered by a specific stimulus or situation. Sufferers typically anticipate terrifying consequences from encountering the object of their fear, which can be anything from an animal to a location to a bodily fluid. Post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an anxiety disorder which results from a traumatic experience. Post-traumatic stress can result from an extreme situation, such as combat, rape, hostage situations, or even serious accident. It can also result from long term (chronic) exposure to a severe stressor, for example soldiers who endure individual battles but cannot cope with continuous combat. Common symptoms include flashbacks, avoidant behaviors, and depression. Neurodegenerative Diseases and Disorders The term “neurodegenerative disease” includes diseases and disorders that are associated with the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, or death of neurons. Neurodegenerative diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer’s disease (including the associated symptoms of mild, moderate, or severe cognitive impairment); amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); anoxic and ischemic injuries; ataxia and convulsion (including for the treatment and prevention and prevention of seizures that are caused by schizoaffective disorder or by drugs used to treat schizophrenia); benign forgetfulness; brain edema; cerebellar ataxia including McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome (MLS); closed head injury; coma; contusive injuries (e.g., spinal cord injury and head injury); dementias including multi-infarct dementia and senile dementia; disturbances of consciousness; Down syndrome; drug-induced or medication-induced Parkinsonism (such as neuroleptic-induced acute akathisia, acute dystonia, Parkinsonism, or tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or medication-induced postural tremor); epilepsy; fragile X syndrome; Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome; head trauma; hearing impairment and loss; Huntington’s disease; Lennox syndrome; levodopa-induced dyskinesia; mental retardation; movement disorders including akinesias and akinetic (rigid) syndromes (including basal ganglia calcification, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, Parkinsonism-ALS dementia complex, Parkinson’s disease, postencephalitic parkinsonism, and progressively supranuclear palsy); muscular spasms and disorders associated with muscular spasticity or weakness including chorea (such as benign hereditary chorea, drug-induced chorea, hemiballism, Huntington’s disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Sydenham’s chorea, and symptomatic chorea), dyskinesia (including tics such as complex tics, simple tics, and symptomatic tics), myoclonus (including generalized myoclonus and focal cyloclonus), tremor (such as rest tremor, postural tremor, and intention tremor) and dystonia (including axial dystonia, dystonic writer's cramp, hemiplegic dystonia, paroxysmal dystonia, and focal dystonia such as blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, and spasmodic dysphonia and torticollis); neuronal damage including ocular damage, retinopathy or macular degeneration of the eye; neurotoxic injury which follows cerebral stroke, thromboembolic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral ischemia, cerebral vasospasm, hypoglycemia, amnesia, hypoxia, anoxia, perinatal asphyxia and cardiac arrest; Parkinson’s disease; seizure; status epilecticus; stroke; tinnitus; tubular sclerosis, and viral infection induced neurodegeneration (e.g., caused by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and encephalopathies). Neurodegenerative diseases also include, but are not limited to, neurotoxic injury which follows cerebral stroke, thromboembolic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral ischemia, cerebral vasospasm, hypoglycemia, amnesia, hypoxia, anoxia, perinatal asphyxia and cardiac arrest. Methods of treating or preventing a neurodegenerative disease also include treating or preventing loss of neuronal function characteristic of neurodegenerative disorder. Epilepsy Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by repeated seizures over time. Types of epilepsy can include, but are not limited to generalized epilepsy, e.g., childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile nyoclonic epilepsy, epilepsy with grand-mal seizures on awakening, West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, partial epilepsy, e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy, frontal lobe epilepsy, benign focal epilepsy of childhood. Status epilepticus (SE) Status epilepticus (SE) can include, e.g., convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., early status epilepticus, established status epilepticus, refractory status epilepticus, super-refractory status epilepticus; ηοηconvulsive status epilepticus, e.g., generalized status epilepticus, complex partial status epilepticus; generalized periodic epileptiform discharges; and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges. Convulsive status epilepticus is characterized by the presence of convulsive status epileptic seizures, and can include early status epilepticus, established status epilepticus, refractory status epilepticus, super-refractory status epilepticus. Early status epilepticus is treated with a first line therapy. Established status epilepticus is characterized by status epileptic seizures which persist despite treatment with a first line therapy, and a second line therapy is administered. Refractory status epilepticus is characterized by status epileptic seizures which persist despite treatment with a first line and a second line therapy, and a general anesthetic is generally administered. Super refractory status epilepticus is characterized by status epileptic seizures which persist despite treatment with a first line therapy, a second line therapy, and a general anesthetic for 24 hours or more. Non-convulsive status epilepticus can include, e.g., focal non-convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., complex partial non-convulsive status epilepticus, simple partial non-convulsive status epilepticus, subtle non-convulsive status epilepticus; generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., late onset absence non-convulsive status epilepticus, atypical absence non-convulsive status epilepticus, or typical absence non-convulsive status epilepticus. Compositions described herein can also be administered as a prophylactic to a subject having a CNS disorder e.g., a traumatic brain injury, status epilepticus, e.g., convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., early status epilepticus, established status epilepticus, refractory status epilepticus, super-refractory status epilepticus; non-convulsive status epilepticus, e.g., generalized status epilepticus, complex partial status epilepticus; generalized periodic epileptiform discharges; and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges; prior to the onset of a seizure. Seizure A seizure is the physical findings or changes in behavior that occur after an episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The term “seizure” is often used interchangeably with “convulsion.” Convulsions are when a person’s body shakes rapidly and uncontrollably. During convulsions, the person’s muscles contract and relax repeatedly. Based on the type of behavior and brain activity, seizures are divided into two broad categories: generalized and partial (also called local or focal). Classifying the type of seizure helps doctors diagnose whether or not a patient has epilepsy. Generalized seizures are produced by electrical impulses from throughout the entire brain, whereas partial seizures are produced (at least initially) by electrical impulses in a relatively small part of the brain. The part of the brain generating the seizures is sometimes called the focus. There are six types of generalized seizures. The most common and dramatic, and therefore the most well known, is the generalized convulsion, also called the grand-mal seizure. In this type of seizure, the patient loses consciousness and usually collapses. The loss of consciousness is followed by generalized body stiffening (called the "tonic" phase of the seizure) for 30 to 60 seconds, then by violent jerking (the "clonic" phase) for 30 to 60 seconds, after which the patient goes into a deep sleep (the "postictal" or after-seizure phase). During grand-mal seizures, injuries and accidents may occur, such as tongue biting and urinary incontinence. Absence seizures cause a short loss of consciousness (just a few seconds) with few or no symptoms. The patient, most often a child, typically interrupts an activity and stares blankly. These seizures begin and end abruptly and may occur several times a day. Patients are usually not aware that they are having a seizure, except that they may be aware of "losing time." Myoclonic seizures consist of sporadic jerks, usually on both sides of the body. Patients sometimes describe the jerks as brief electrical shocks. When violent, these seizures may result in dropping or involuntarily throwing objects. Clonic seizures are repetitive, rhythmic jerks that involve both sides of the body at the same time. Tonic seizures are characterized by stiffening of the muscles. Atonic seizures consist of a sudden and general loss of muscle tone, particularly in the arms and legs, which often results in a fall. Seizures described herein can include epileptic seizures; acute repetitive seizures; cluster seizures; continuous seizures; unremitting seizures; prolonged seizures; recurrent seizures; status epilepticus seizures, e.g., refractory convulsive status epilepticus, non-convulsive status epilepticus seizures; refractory seizures; myoclonic seizures; tonic seizures; tonic-clonic seizures; simple partial seizures; complex partial seizures; secondarily generalized seizures; atypical absence seizures; absence seizures; atonic seizures; benign Rolandic seizures; febrile seizures; emotional seizures; focal seizures; gelastic seizures; generalized onset seizures; infantile spasms; Jacksonian seizures; massive bilateral myoclonus seizures; multifocal seizures; neonatal onset seizures; nocturnal seizures; occipital lobe seizures; post traumatic seizures; subtle seizures; Sylvan seizures; visual reflex seizures; or withdrawal seizures.

LCMS: Rt = 2.27 mm. m/z = 403.2 [M+H]+. Assay Methods Compounds provided herein can be evaluated using various assays; examples of which are described below. Steroid Inhibition of TBPS Binding (35S]-t-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding assays using rat brain cortical membranes in the presence of 5 μΜ GABA has been described (Gee et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987, 241, 346-353; Hawkinson et al, Mol. Pharmacol. 1994, 46, 977-985; Lewin, Α.Η et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 1989,35, 189-194). Briefly, cortices are rapidly removed following decapitation of carbon dioxide-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g). The cortices are homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 0.32 Μ sucrose using a glass/teflon homogenizer and centrifuged at 1500 χ g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants are centrifuged at 10,000 χ g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the Ρ2 pellets. The Ρ2 pellets are resuspended in 200 mM NaCl/50 mM Na-K phosphate pH 7.4 buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 χ g for 10 min at 4 °C. This washing procedure is repeated twice and the pellets are resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer. Aliquots (100 pL) of the membrane suspensions are incubated with 3 ηΜ [35S]-TBPS and 5 pL aliquots of test drug dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (final 0.5%) in the presence of 5 μΜ GABA. The incubation is brought to a final volume of 1.0 mL with buffer. Nonspecific binding is determined in the presence of 2 μΜ unlabeled TBPS and ranged from 15 to 25 %. Following a 90 min incubation at room temp, the assays are terminated by filtration through glass fiber filters (Schleicher and Schuell No. 32) using a cell harvester (Brandel) and rinsed three times with ice-cold buffer. Filter bound radioactivity is measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Non-linear curve fitting of the overall data for each drug averaged for each concentration is done using Prism (GraphPad). The data are fit to a partial instead of a full inhibition model if the sum of squares is significantly lower by F-test. Similarly, the data are fit to a two component instead of a one component inhibition model if the sum of squares is significantly lower by F-test. The concentration of test compound producing 50% inhibition (IC50) of specific binding and the maximal extent of inhibition (Imax) are determined for the individual experiments with the same model used for the overall data and then the means + SEM.s of the individual experiments are calculated. Picrotoxin serves as the positive control for these studies as it has been demonstrated to robustly inhibit TBPS binding. Various compounds are or can be screened to determine their potential as modulators of [35S]TBPS binding in vitro. These assays are or can be performed in accordance with the above discussed procedures. Patch clamp electrophysiology of recombinant α1β2γ2 and α4β3δ GABAj receptors Cellular electrophysiology is used to measure the pharmacological properties of our GABAa receptor modulators in heterologous cell systems. Each compound is tested for its ability to affect GABA mediated currents at a submaximal agonist dose (GABA EC20 = 2μΜ). LTK cells are stably transfected with the αφ2γ2 subunits of the GABA receptor and CHO cells are transiently transfected with the α4β3δ subunits via the Lipofecatamine method. Cells were passaged at a confluence of about 50-80% and then seeded onto 35mm sterile culture dishes containing 2 ml culture complete medium without antibiotics or antimycotics. Confluent clusters of cells are electrically coupled (Pritchett et al., Science , 1988, 242, 1306-1308.). Because responses in distant cells are not adequately voltage clamped and because of uncertainties about the extent of coupling (Verdoorn et al., Neuron 1990, 4, 919-928. ), cells were cultivated at a density that enables the recording of single cells (without visible connections to other cells). Whole cell currents were measured with ΗΕΚΑ EPC-10 amplifiers using PatchMaster software or by using the high throughput QPatch platform (Sophion). Bath solution for all experiments contained (in mM): NaCl 137 mM, KC1 4 mM, CaCl2 1.8 mM, MgCl2 1 mM, HEPES 10 mM, D-Glucose 10 mM, pH (NaOH) 7.4. In some cases 0.005% cremophor was also added. Intracellular (pipette) solution contained: KC1 130 mM, MgCl2 1 mM, Mg-ATP 5mM, HEPES 10 mM, EGTA 5mM, pH 7.2. During experiments, cells and solutions were maintained at room temperature (19°C - 30°C). For manual patch clamp recordings, cell culture dishes were placed on the dish holder of the microscope and continuously perfused (1 ml/min) with bath solution. After formation of a Gigaohm seal between the patch electrodes and the cell (pipette resistance range: 2.5 ΜΩ - 6.0 ΜΩ; seal resistance range:>l ΟΩ) the cell membrane across the pipette tip was ruptured to assure electrical access to the cell interior (whole-cell patch-configuration). For experiments using the QPatch system, cells were transferred as suspension to the QPatch system in the bath solution and automated whole cell recordings were performed. Cells were voltage clamped at a holding potential of -80 mV. For the analysis of test articles, GABA receptors were stimulated by 2 μΜ GABA after sequential pre-incubation of increasing concentrations of the test article. Pre-incubation duration was 30 s and the duration of the GABA stimulus was 2s. Test articles were dissolved in DMSO to form stock solutions (lOmM). Test articles were diluted to 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μΜ in bath solution. All concentrations of test articles were tested on each cell. The relative percentage potentiation was defined as the peak amplitude in response to GABA EC20 in the presence of the test article divided by the peak amplitude in response to GABA EC20 alone, multiplied by 100. Loss of Righting Reflex in Rats The plasma pharmacokinetics and a qualitative assessment of sedation were obtained in male Sprague Dawley rats according to the following procedure. Rats were dosed by intravenous bolus dose (60 seconds) via the foot dorsal vein at doses ranging from 5 to 15 mg/kg in an appropriate vehicle. In order to assess sedation, rats were gently restrained by hand to a lateral position for dose administration. If decreased muscle tone was observed during dose administration, restraint was gradually reduced. If the animal was unable to return to an upright position, the time was recorded as the onset of loss of righting reflex (LRR). In the event that LRR did not occur during dosing, the animals were evaluated at 5 minute intervals thereafter by being placed in dorsal recumbency. Sluggish or incomplete righting twice consecutively within a 30 second interval qualifies as a loss of righting reflex. After onset of LRR, animals were assessed every 5 minutes in the same manner. Recovery of righting reflex is defined as the ability of a rat to right itself completely within 20 seconds of being placed in dorsal recumbency. The duration of LRR is defined as the time interval between LRR and the return of righting reflex. Acute ΡΤΖ Method The anticonvulsant effect of test compounds were assessed in the pentylenetetazol-induced seizure assay in mice similar to methods described in Giardina & Gasior (2009) Curr Protoc Pharmacol., Chapter 5. Male CD-I mice were housed in groups of five under controlled conditions (temperature of 22±2°C and 12:12 light-dark cycle, lights on at 8:00 am) and water and food were available ad libitum. The mice were housed for 1 week prior to behavioral testing, at which time they weighed 25-35g. Pentylenetetrazol (ΡΤΖ, Sigma) was dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline at a concentration of 12 mg/mL concentration for subcutaneous administration. Test compounds were formulated and administered via oral gavage or intraperitoneal injection at a predetermined timepoint (typically 30 or 60 minutes) prior to ΡΤΖ injection. All solutions were made fresh and were given in a volume of lOml/kg body weight. Mice were acclimated to the test room for at least 30 min before compound administration. Mice were randomized into at least four test groups (vehicle and at least three doses of the test compound) with 10 mice per group. After compound administration, mice were observed for qualitative assessment of sedation for a pre-determined time point (30 or 60 minutes). Following the drug pretreatment time the mice were injected s.c. with ΡΤΖ (120 mg/kg). Immediately following the ΡΤΖ injection, mice were individually placed into observation chambers (25x15x15cm) and a three-channel timer was started. Each mouse was continuously observed for 30 min and the following behaviors were recorded by observers blinded to the treatments: 1) latency to clonic convulsions that persist for 3 sec and followed by an absence of righting reflex 2) latency to tonic convulsions, characterized by the rigid extension of all four limbs that exceeded a 90 degree angle with the body 3) latency to death 4) number of clonic and tonic convulsions. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M and one-way analysis of variance with Dunnetfs or Bonferroni's post-hoc test was used to detect significant differences in latency and number between the vehicle and dose group, ρ values <0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
