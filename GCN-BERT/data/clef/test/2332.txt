CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. provisional application No. 61/947,794 titled “IOHEXOL POWDER AND METHOD OF USING THE SAME”, filed Mar. 4, 2014, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Iohexol is a known contrast agent having the following structure: Oral solutions of iohexol are useful as contrast agents for e.g. abdominal imaging by tomography. It is convenient to provide iohexol for such purposes in a solid form which can be reconstituted into an oral contrast solution prior to use. However, although iohexol is highly soluble in water, iohexol particles tend to form large, cohesive, sticky aggregates which dissolve very slowly. Typically, complete dissolution requires extended stirring or elevated temperatures which can lead to degradation of the iohexol in non-buffered systems. Since it is desirable to reconstitute solid (e.g. powdered) iohexol by manually mixing the solid iohexol composition in an appropriate diluent (e.g. water or a flavored aqueous solution) at the physician's office or at an imaging facility, there is a risk that the iohexol composition will not completely dissolve under such conditions, and therefore the patient will receive a lower concentration and dose of the iohexol contrast agent than is desirable for proper imaging. Accordingly, it is important that the iohexol be provided in a form that dissolves rapidly and completely when subjected to manual mixing conditions so that the patient is provided with the full dosage of iohexol, at the proper concentration. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Compositions and methods are described herein for iohexol. In the various embodiments described herein, the contrast agent composition comprises particles of iohexol that substantially dissolve in water within about 60 seconds or less when tested using a Modified United States Pharmacopeia Method 641 as described herein. In some embodiments, the contrast agent composition comprises particles of iohexol which have one or more of the following characteristics: a bulk density of less than about 0.8 g/cm3, an interparticle spacing greater than about 60% of bulk volume, and a specific surface area greater than about 0.8 m2/g. In other embodiments, the contrast agent composition comprises iohexol crystals with a particular crystal structure, for example exhibiting a powder x-ray diffraction pattern substantially as described herein, and having 2θ peaks at about 7.6°, 16.2°, 19.9°, 20.8°, 22.3°, 29.8°, and 30.7°. In still other embodiments, the contrast agent composition comprises particles of iohexol prepared by a process comprising crystallizing iohexol from a solvent mixture which comprises alcohol, alkyl acetate and water. The crystallization is carried out by heating the solution of iohexol in the solvent mixture (e.g. at reflux) and under vigorous agitation (e.g. stirring) conditions. In some embodiments, the contrast agent composition comprises iohexol particles with a particle size distribution having one or more of the following characteristics: D90 of no more than about 40 μm, D50 of no more than about 20 μm, and D10 of no more than about 10 μm. In some embodiments, the contrast agent composition is prepared by spray drying a 30-40% (w/w) solution of iohexol. The inlet temperature of the spray drier falls within the range of about 220-255° C., and the outlet temperature falls within the range of about 95-115° C. In some embodiments, the method of preparing iohexol crystals includes (a) heating a solution of iohexol in a solvent comprising alcohol, alkyl acetate, and water to reflux, with agitation. The method further includes (b) removing one or more of the alcohol, alkyl acetate, and water by distilling the solution of iohexol. The method further includes (c) maintaining the solution of iohexol with agitation at temperature from 60° C. up to reflux at atmospheric, reduced, or elevated pressure, whereby a suspension of crystals of substantially exo iohexol are formed. The method further includes (d) cooling the suspension of step (b) to about 40-50° C., with agitation, and (e) filtering and drying the suspension.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Rapidly dissolving compositions of iohexol, and the preparation and use thereof are provided herein. Aspects of the disclosure provide for compositions of iohexol with particular characteristics to enable rapid dissolution including, but not limited to, particle size distribution, particle characteristics, crystalline form and/or the like. Aspects of the disclosure also provide for methods of producing compositions of rapidly dissolving iohexol by the use of particular crystallization or spray drying conditions. All documents, patents, and patent applications cited herein are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. As used herein, the term “Modified United States Pharmacopeia Method 641” denotes a modified form of the Standard United States Pharmacopeia Method 641, where the Modified United States Pharmacopeia Method 641 is carried out as follows: Place 1.8 g of the particulate iohexol in a meticulously clean, glass-stoppered, 50 mL glass cylinder approximately 1:10 diameter to height in size.Fill 40 mL of tap water adjusted to 10° C. (±2° C.) into the glass cylinder.Immediately start shaking the glass cylinder and start recording total time.Shake the glass cylinder with an up and down movement, keeping the frequency at 12-13 movements per 5 seconds.After 20 seconds observe for 3 seconds for completeness of dissolution.Evaluate after 3 seconds, when the bubbles disappear, comparing with pure solvent.If dissolved completely, record “dissolved in 20 seconds”.If not dissolved completely, continue shaking for a total time 30 secRepeat the dissolution evaluation at 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 1 min., and 1 min. 30 seconds.Always repeat the dissolution evaluation using the same procedure.If dissolved completely at time point 1 min 30 sec, record “dissolved in NMT 1 min 30 sec”.If not dissolved, record “not dissolved in 1 min 30 sec”. As used herein, the term “unit dose” denotes a physically identifiable, fixed amount of iohexol, provided for use. However, such fixed, “unit dose” need not comprise the entire amount required for the needs of a given imaging procedure. For example, a given imaging procedure may require more than a unit dose (e.g., multiple unit doses may be combined), or require less than unit dose (e.g., less than the entire amount of iohexol consumed after dissolution in an appropriate diluent). As used herein, the term “bulk density” of a material denotes total mass of the material divided by the total volume occupied by the material. As used herein, the term “interparticle spacing” denotes the percentage of the “bulk” particle volume which is free space. The interparticle spacing can be calculated from the bulk density and skeletal density. As discussed above, bulk density refers to the density determined by dividing the weight of the sample by its measured volume, for example using the USP <616> method. The skeletal density, sometimes referred to as the “true density,” is determined by dividing the weight of a sample by its “true” volume—i.e., the volume excluding interstitial voids and any open porosity in the sample (e.g., determined by gas displacement techniques). Interparticle spacing can be calculated from the bulk density and skeletal density as exemplified herein: if the bulk density of a particular iohexol sample is ˜0.9 g/cm3, the corresponding “bulk” volume for 1 g of the sample is 1.11 cm3; and if the skeletal density of the sample is ˜2 g/cm3, the corresponding “skeletal” volume (i.e. volume with porosity excluded) for 1 g of this sample is 0.5 cm3. The difference between the “bulk” volume and “skeletal” volume, 0.61 cm3, represents the volume of the free space (porosity) in the particle. The interparticle spacing is the difference between the “skeletal” volume and bulk volume, divided by the “bulk” volume, expressed as a percentage (i.e. 0.61 cm3/1.11 cm3=55% in this example). As used herein, the “specific surface area” of a material denotes the total surface area of the material per unit of mass of the material. As used herein, the “D90” of a particulate material denotes a diameter value for the particles in the material at which about 90% of the particles have a diameter below the diameter value. For example, in a sample with a D90 of 20 μm, 90% of the particles in the sample have a diameter of 20 μm or less. As used herein, the “D50” of a material denotes a diameter value for the particles in the material at which about 50% of the particles have a diameter below the diameter value. For example, in a sample with a D50 of 10 μm, 50% of the particles in the sample have a diameter of 10 μm or less. As used herein, the “D10” of a material denotes a diameter value for the particles in the material at which about 10% of the particles have a diameter below the diameter value. For example, in a sample with a D10 of 5 μm, 10% of the particles in the sample have a diameter of 5 μm or less. As used herein, a “functional excipient or additive” denotes an excipient or additive that increases or enhances the dissolution properties of the iohexol composition, for example, increasing the solubility or dissolution rate of the iohexol. In other words, the rate of dissolution of an iohexol composition with the functional excipient or additive is moderately or substantially higher than that of an otherwise identical iohexol composition without the functional excipient or additive. For example, if the addition of a particular excipient or additive to the contrast agent composition reduces the dissolution time by about 10 or more seconds (e.g., as measured by the Modified USP Method 641 described herein, and as compared to an otherwise identical formulation without the excipient or additive), then such excipient or additive would be considered a “functional excipient or additive.” Examples of function excipients and additives include, but are not limited to, disintegrating agents (croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, carboxymethyl starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc.), dispersants, beta-cyclodextrins and analogs, anticaking agents (e.g. colloidal silicon dioxide, etc.), lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, polyethylene glycols, etc.) and so forth. As used herein, the term “non-functional excipient or additive” denotes an excipient or additive that is not a functional excipient or additive (i.e., does not moderately or substantially increase or enhance the dissolution properties of the iohexol). For example, if the addition of a particular excipient or additive to the contrast agent composition only slightly reduces the dissolution time (e.g., by about 5 seconds or less as measured by the Modified USP Method 641 described herein, and as compared to an otherwise identical formulation without the excipient or additive), or does not change the dissolution time, or increases the dissolution time, then such excipient or additive would be considered a “non-functional excipient or additive.” Typically, nonlimiting examples of non-functional excipients or additives include flavoring agents (e.g. sweeteners) or coloring agents, provided such excipients or additives do not enhance the dissolution of the iohexol. As used herein, the term “sterile” indicates that a substance and/or element has been treated to be and/or is believed to be substantially free of undesirable microorganisms such as, but not limited to, a virus, a bacteria, and/or the like. As used herein, the term “non-sterile” indicates that a substance and/or element has not been treated to be and/or is believed not to be substantially free of undesirable microorganisms such as, but not limited to, a virus, a bacteria, and/or the like. The term “about” when used in connection with a numerical value means the numerical value, plus or minus up to 15% of that value. For example, “about 100” means from 85 to 115. In other embodiments, term “about” means the referenced numerical value plus or minus up to 10% of that referenced numerical value. For example, “about 100” means from 90 to 110. In particular contexts, the term “about” with regard to a series of numerical values refers to the numerical value, plus or minus half of the interval (without overlap) between the numerical values in the series.

The particles of iohexol according to the present invention can be in crystalline form, in amorphous form, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the contrast agent composition of the present invention comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of particles of iohexol in substantially crystalline form. The term “substantially crystalline form” refers to material which is predominantly crystalline, but may contain small amounts of amorphous material (e.g., less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less than about 3%, less than about 4%, less than about 5%, including ranges and subranges therebetween). In other embodiments, the contrast agent composition of the present invention comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of particles of iohexol in substantially amorphous form.

In some embodiments, the container is manually agitated for no more than about 40 seconds. Some embodiments of the invention are directed to administering an iohexol contrast solution to a patient in need thereof, such as, for example, prior to an imaging procedure to be performed on the patient. The administering can include preparing an iohexol contrast solution as described herein, and administering the iohexol contrast solution to the patient, for example by oral administration. In some embodiments, administering an iohexol contrast solution to a patient in need thereof includes (a) adding a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous diluent to a container containing a contrast agent composition that includes particles of iohexol that substantially dissolve in water within about 60 seconds when tested using Modified United States Pharmacopeia Method 641. The administering further includes (b) agitating the container for no more than 90 seconds, whereby substantially all of the iohexol contrast agent is dissolved. The administering further includes administering the contrast solution to the patient. In various embodiments, the processes described herein can provide specific shape(s) and particles size(s) and particle size distributions of the iohexol, which in turn can improve the solubility characteristics of the iohexol. For example, the iohexol particles crystallized according to the methods described herein can be characterized as agglomerates of smaller crystals, with high specific surface area. This high specific surface area can enable extensive contact with the diluent during reconstitution of compositions containing such forms of iohexol, resulting in a rapid dissolution rate, without the formation of sticky masses of iohexol in the distillation vessel during the dissolution process. Conventional spray-dried iohexol, which typically forms spherically shaped particles with low surface area, has a poorer (slower) dissolution rate compared to that of the crystallized or spray dried iohexol according to the present invention. Various of the embodiments disclosed herein provide for iohexol crystallization and preferential formation of exo isomers. In other words, the iohexol formed thereby comprises substantially the exo isomer. Based on observations (see Examples below), exo iohexol has a lower tendency to absorb moisture than naturally occurring iohexol, which typically contains both endo and exo isomers. Each rotational isomer (exo and endo) can have a different crystal structure. It is believed that this difference can lead to a different extent of water penetration into the crystal lattice, resulting in faster dissolution of the exo iohexol isomer. Thus, in embodiments of the present invention in which substantially exo iohexol is provided, more rapid dissolution can be provided compared to conventional formulations comprising a mixture of endo and exo iohexol. In other embodiments disclosed herein, the ratio of endo and exo isomers of iohexol in the composition can be changed by changing the composition of the solvent mixture used during crystallization, for example, changing the ratio of e.g., water, ethyl acetate, and ethanol used in the crystallization. Traditionally the preparation and dosing of iodinated contrast media requires the combination of separate components in order to prepare a single dose unit (unit dose) which is delivered to the patient. These components include but are not limited to: a bottle of liquid, concentrated contrast media, a measuring device such as a syringe or other measuring device and one or two cups for dispensing. Embodiments disclosed herein can be useful as part of a self-contained kit for the administration of oral contrast media, where all these components can be provided as part of the kit. The compositions of the present invention can be diluted with various diluents which provide stable solutions suitable for human consumption. These diluents can include, for example, beverages such as lemonade (e.g., powdered lemonade or other fruit flavored beverage mixes), sports drinks (e.g., isotonic sports beverages), a variety of fruit juices, water, infant formula, etc. Such flavored diluents are intended to increase patient compliance (i.e., the likelihood that the patient will finish the entire dose) by masking any unpleasant or objectionable flavor of the iohexol. EXAMPLES Example 1 Four powder samples of Iohexol particles were prepared according to the invention for further structural analysis (Table 1) TABLE 1 Sample Crystallized from JM-111013 ethanol JM-081213_IPA 2-propanol JM-081213_n-propanol 1-propanol JM-081213_n-butanol 1-butanol Data Collection Two methods for crystal characterization were used: a) X-ray powder analysis—small amount of all four samples were measured.b) X-ray structure determination—a suitable single crystal of iohexol was found in sample JM-081213_n-butanol and directly mounted on goniometer head for the crystal structure determination. Results X-Ray Powder Analysis All four measured samples have similar X-ray powder patterns as shown in FIG. 1. The number of the peaks for all four samples in the 2θ range (5-20°, reasonably separated peaks) are similar, and the positions of the peaks can be reasonably determined to be about the same, within experimental error. In accordance with the observed patterns, all four samples appear to have substantially the same crystal structure (see FIG. 1) which are very similar to the powder pattern calculated from the crystal structure data. The relative intensities of the peaks are similar for the samples JM-081213_n-propanol, JM-081213_IPA and JM-111013 and are comparable to those calculated from the crystal structure data. Unit Cell Parameters for Sample JM-111013 The automatic indexing of results obtained using DICVOLO4 show that the iohexol crystals formed are monoclinic with space group P21/c and the unit-cell parameters were least-square refined to the values: a=14.722(3) Å, α=90°b=18.921(4) Å, β=91.281(3)°c=9.295(2) Å, γ=90°Volume: 2589(1) Å3 Crystal Class: monoclinicCell determined from: 107 reflectionsCell 2θ range=5-60°Temperature: 293 K Example 2 Evaluation of Difference in Dissolving Time Between Iohexol Substance Prepared by Different Isolation Techniques Samples 1) Iohexol crystallized according to the invention—two batches, 03302012 and 01206013. 2) Conventional spray-dried iohexol—two batches, labeled Conventional Samples #1 and #2. 4) Iohexol spray-dried according to the invention—batch 03202012/1. 5) Iohexol spray-dried according to the invention, and according to a modified procedure, batch 03202012/8. 6) Iohexol spray-dried according to the invention, and according to a modified procedure, batch 03202012/9.

This material dissolved rapidly. The worst results were provided by conventional, spray-dried iohexol, which provided unsuitable dissolution times of 1 min 30 sec. This material had a lower surface area compared to the crystallized iohexol. In addition, the conventionally spray dried iohexol powder, after pouring water into the bottle, forms a glue-like layer than sticks at the bottom and increases the dissolution time. Spray dried material was prepared using various conditions: conventional spray drying conditions (input temperature 255° C., output 95° C.), and modified spray drying conditions (input temperature 220° C., output 75° C.; and input temperature 220° C., output 115° C.). The best performance was provided by one of the modified spray drying conditions (input temperature 220° C., output 115° C.) which provided smaller iohexol particles. The improved particle size was provided by the presence of smaller particles overall (D50 around 16 microns) and a very narrow particle size distribution, almost free of particles bigger than 30 microns. In contrast, the particle size distribution prepared by conventional spray drying methods is much wider, with a substantial amount of particles bigger than 30 microns, and a significant amount more than 50 microns. Example 3 Evaluation of Particle Morphology, Skeletal, Apparent Densities and Specific Surface Areas of Variously Prepared Iohexol The solid iohexol was obtained by crystallization or by spray drying. It was found that the mode of preparation of the solid phase determines the rate of dissolution of the iohexol. Samples are identified as crystallized iohexol or spray dried iohexol. Each type of iohexol was represented by several samples. Some samples were also exposed to the laboratory atmosphere (e.g., ambient air) and then analyzed. The particle morphology was evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) combined with ion microscope FIB-SEM Tescan Lyra3GU equipped with a number of detectors EDS, EBSD, STEM, EBIC and TOF-SIMS. Due to the non-conductive nature of iohexol, it accumulates an electrical charge which causes deterioration of SEM images. Therefore, iohexol samples were coated with a thin layer of platinum to remove electrical charges and thereby obtain high quality SEM images. Specific surface area was measured using a low-temperature nitrogen adsorption apparatus, a Pulse Chemisorb 2700. Crystallized Iohexol SEM images show that crystallized iohexol forms agglomerates of particles of spherical/ellipsoidal shape, in which the characteristic dimension of the individual particles is approximately 0.5-3 μm as shown in FIG. 2. Also, long rod-shape crystals were observed in all samples of crystallized iohexol (FIG. 3). Such rod-shaped particles are believed to be formed in areas of the crystallization vessel with low or zero intensity of mixing. This assumption was confirmed during a crystallization experiment without stirring, when large rod-shaped crystals, with length up to 100 μm and diameter 3-5 μm, were obtained (FIG. 4). Crystallized iohexol samples were also examined by SME analysis for the influence of air humidity (i.e., humidity of ambient/room air). Crystallized iohexol samples were exposed to air humidity for 120 hours. After this exposure, the sintering of originally separated particles was observed (FIG. 5). The porosity of the iohexol particles was also investigated using mercury intrusion, and the skeletal density was determined by helium pycnometer and physical adsorption of nitrogen. The particle size distribution obtained by mercury porosimetry (FIG. 6) shows the presence of spaces between the agglomerates, and between particles with the characteristic sizes mentioned above (0.5-3 μm). The cavities between the agglomerates have an approximate size between about 1 and about 100 μm. Since this data was obtained by mercury porosimetry, cavity size can be defined as the radius of a cylindrical pore. Smaller cavities correspond to the spaces between the particles. A significant maxima at 300 nm (see significant peak on FIG. 6) corresponds to the size of the narrowest area (window), when three spherical particles with a radius approximately 3 μm are in contact. A further increase of embossed mercury under higher pressures was not observed. This finding excludes the presence of very small, open cavities or pores, and therefore it is assumed that the small particles are not porous. The specific surface area data, which were evaluated using a BET isotherm, support the nonporous nature/character of the particles. The measured value of the specific surface area was about 2.8 m2/g, which is consistent with the calculation of the specific surface area of hypothetical material which consists of non-porous spheres with a radius of 3 μm. Considering the skeletal density of crystallized iohexol (2.097 g/cm3), the calculated specific surface area of this hypothetical material is about 4 m2/g. All data provided by analyses appear to support the conclusion that the crystallized iohexol solid material contains agglomerates consisting of small nonporous particles and that the total specific area is the sum of the outer surface areas of these particles. Spray Dried Iohexol Three different samples of spray dried iohexol were selected for evaluation: 1) Spray dried iohexol produced according to the invention using the spray drying conditions described above in Example 2 (batch number 00405003).2) Conventional spray dried iohexol (Conventional Sample #2).3) Freshly produced spray dried iohexol (batch number 03202012/1) according to the present invention, produced using the same conditions as used for sample number 00405003, above. In all samples, the particles appear as separate units without mechanical binding to other particles. Particle sizes of samples 1) or 3) appear to be almost the same and show two main sizes. The first is about 10 μm and the second value is about 25 μm (see FIG. 7). The surface morphology of the particles is characterized by the presence of depressions and craters. By contrast to samples 1) and 3), the conventional spray dried iohexol of sample 2) (FIG. 8) appears to be more uniform in distribution of the characteristic size of the particles. Also, particles of sample 2) shows a less rugged surface (shallow depressions and craters). The surface is cover with a film, similar to the sintered crystallized material of FIG. 5, i.e., after its exposure to air humidity. Sample 2) also shows multiple bridges between particles. In order to find possible pores or cavities inside of particles, one selected spherical particle of sample 1) was cut using an ion beam. The analysis of the SEM image (see FIGS. 9A-9C) did not show any porousity. In addition, the skeletal density (2.029 g/cm3) is almost identical to the value found for crystallized iohexol, which as discussed above is demonstrably non-porous, and therefore the hypothetical existence of closed porosity in the conventionally spray dried iohexol can be excluded. The specific surface of spray dried iohexol materials was found to be less than 1 m2/g, which is consistent with this observation. This value is determined by the limit of detection of the apparatus and method described herein. A comparison of the specific amount of nitrogen desorbed from the samples provides an estimate that the specific surface area of spray dried iohexol is approximately 12 to 15 times lower than that of crystallized iohexol. These results are also consistent with theoretical values of specific surface area based on the assumption that the particles are simple geometric objects with dimensions according to SEM images. Discussion of Values of Specific Surface Area Experimentally obtained values of the specific surface area are very low, which is typical of macroporous to non-porous materials. Experimental specific surface area values for all samples are in good agreement with the estimated values based on SEM image analysis, (calculating the particle surface area based on the geometrical shape of particles, i.e., and assuming that the particles are not porous (confirmed by mercury porosimetry as discussed above). Individual values and comparisons of the amount of nitrogen desorption for each sample are summarized in Table 5.

Example 4 Iohexol Purification An aqueous solution (2200 Kg) with conductivity less than 5 μS/cm and containing 426.0 kg of raw iohexol with less than 1.5% of starting material and less than 1.6% O-alkylated related by-products is concentrated under reduced pressure to an approximate weight of 1000 Kg. 775 L of ethyl acetate is added and a portion of the water is removed via azeotropic distillation under reduced pressure. Ethyl acetate is partially (220 L) removed by distillation at reduced pressure, followed by addition of 1700 L of ethanol. A portion of the remaining ethyl acetate is removed by azeotropic distillation by means of the binary ethanol/ethyl acetate azeotrope. The resulting ethanol solution of iohexol with small amounts of ethyl acetate and water is maintained under reflux and vigorous stirring until massive crystallization occurs. The suspension is vigorously stirring for 48 hours. The mixture is cooled to 40-50° C. and the product is filtered off, washed and dried in process filter-dryer. The yield of crystallized iohexol is 320 Kg with melting point 246-254° C. Example 5 Particles Characteristics of Iohexol Powder Three types of solid forms of iohexol were investigated and prepared by: Crystallized iohexol—crystallization from organic solvents, finished by drying and sieving. Spray dryed iohexol—spray drying from aqueous solution. All forms of iohexol were examined for the following characteristics: Morphology of particles (aggregation, agglomeration, geometry, size)Particle size distributionPorositySpecific surface areaBulk and skeletal densityCrystallinityHygroscopicity The parameters are summarized in following table 6: TABLE 6 Parameters Interparticle Specific Particle Size Skeletal space surface Iohexol Dissolution distribution (μm) Bulk density density (% of bulk area material code time (s) D10 D50 D90 (g/cm3) (g/cm3) volume) m2/g Crystallized 01206013 40 5 10 15 0.56 2.0 73 4.00 03302012 40 5 10 16 0.56 2.0 73 4.00 Spray dryed 03202012/1 60 9 14 22 0.90 2.0 56 0.50 03202012/8 40 7 12 19 0.90 2.0 56 0.50 03202012/9 60 11 20 35 0.90 2.0 56 0.50 Conventional 90 7 27 61 0.90 2.0 56 0.50 Sample #1 Conventional 90 7 29 66 0.90 2.0 56 0.50 Sample #2 Crystallinity—the crystalline character of crystallized iohexol was confirmed by XRPD. Spray dried iohexol was found to be essentially amorphous. Particle morphology—crystallized iohexol forms agglomerates of particles of spherical/ellipsoidal shape having a characteristic dimension of the individual particles approximately 0.5-3 μm. Particles are organized in agglomerates with average D50 of 10 μm. Spray dried iohexol is formed of spherical units with or without mechanical binding to other particles, depending on drying conditions. Also, the particle size distribution varies in D50 from 14 to 29 μm. All particles are characterized by the presence of depressions and craters. Skeletal density, bulk density—All forms of iohexol have substantially the same skeletal density, which is evidence that the mass of the interior of the particles is organized in a similar manner. Crystallized iohexol exhibited lower bulk density than spray dried iohexol. Surprisingly, the bulk density was found to play an important role in the dissolution characteristics of iohexol. Porosity—all forms of iohexol were found to be non-porous. Specific surface areas of all examined forms are relatively small due to the absence of pores; however the difference between crystallized iohexol and spray dried iohexol is significant. Crystallized iohexol has a specific surface area of about 4 m2/g, and spray dried iohexol is a specific surface area of about 0.5 m2/g. Dissolution time—the time required for complete dissolution for all forms of iohexol was tested. The values obtained vary from 30 to 90 seconds.
