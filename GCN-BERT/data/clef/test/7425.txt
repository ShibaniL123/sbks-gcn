A tray supporting apparatus 10 for a dishwasher according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 1. In the following description, for example, the tray 200 is a cutlery tray 200 configured to place knives and forks, as shown in FIGS. 1 to 6b. The tray supporting apparatus 100 according to embodiments of the present invention includes: a supporting frame 1 and two brackets adapted to support the tray 200, i.e., a first bracket 2a and a second bracket 2b. As shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 10, a sliding groove 10 is formed in each of two opposite sides of the supporting frame 1, and each sliding groove 10 has a first slideway 101, a second slideway 102 and a third slideway 103 spaced from one another. In some embodiments as shown in FIGS. 1-19, the sliding groove 10 is formed in each of front and rear sides of the supporting frame 1, and the sliding grooves 10 in the front and rear sides have a same structure. Herein, the sliding groove 10 is formed in each of the front and rear sides of the support frame 10, which is taken as an example to illustrate the present invention. Certainly, it may be understood by those having ordinary skills in the related art that the sliding groove 10 may be formed in each of left and right sides of the supporting frame 1 according to actual requirements. The first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b are disposed on the supporting frame 1 respectively. Specially, front and rear ends of each bracket 2 are received in the sliding grooves 10 in the front and rear sides of the supporting frame 1, as shown in FIGS. 1, 10, 1517 and 19. For describing the present invention conveniently, in following description and drawings, motion traces of the front ends of the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b within the sliding groove 10 in the front side of the supporting frame 1 are taken as an example to illustrate the present invention. It should be understood that motion traces of the rear ends of the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b within the sliding groove 10 in the rear side of the supporting frame 1 are the same with those of the front ends, which are omitted herein. As shown in FIGS. 4b, 5b, 6b, 14, 16 and 18, a first end 21a (i.e., a left end in figures) of the first bracket 2a and the second end 21b (i.e., a right end in figures) of the second bracket 2b are slidably received in the first slideway 101, a second end 22a of the first bracket 2a is slidably received in the second slideway 102 and a second end 22b of the second bracket 2b is slidably received in the third slideway 103. With the tray supporting apparatus for the dishwasher according to embodiments of the present invention, by slidably supporting the front ends and the rear ends of the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b in the sliding grooves of the supporting plate 1, the bracket 2 can be driven to move and a position and an angle of the tray 200 disposed on the bracket 2 can be adjusted, such that the position of the tray can be adjusted according to a size of the cutlery placed on the tray, thus making use of an inner space of the dishwasher flexibly and fully. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the sliding groove 10 further includes a first vertical slideway 104 and a second vertical slideway 105. As shown in FIGS. 1a-6b, 14-19, the first vertical slideway 104 is disposed at a left end of the first slideway 101 and is communicated with the first slideway 101, and the second vertical slideway 105 is disposed at a right end of the first slideway 101 and is communicated with the first slideway 101. Therefore, the first end 21a of the first bracket 2a can slide within the first slideway 101 and the first vertical slideway 104, and the first end 21b of the second bracket 2b can slide in the first slideway 101 and the second vertical slideway 105, and thus positions and angles of the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b have many kinds of variations, which facilitates adjusting a position of the tray 200. Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 2, 3, 12 and 13, the first vertical slideway 104 is extended downward from the left end of the first slideway 101 and the second vertical slideway 105 is extended from the right end of the first slideway 101. In some embodiments, the second vertical groove 105 is formed in a middle of the sliding groove 10, i.e. between the first slideway 101 and the third slideway 103, and the first slideway 101 and the third slideway 103 are separated by a top end of the second vertical slideway 105. At this time, a width L1 of the first bracket 2a (a length of the first bracket 2a in a left and right direction, when the first bracket 2a is placed horizontally) and a width L2 of the second bracket 2b (a length of the second bracket 2b in a left and right direction, when the second bracket 2b is placed horizontally) are configured in such a manner that L1+L2<P1+P2, in which P1 is a distance from a top end of the first vertical slideway 104 to a bottom end of the second vertical slideway 105, and P2 is a distance from the bottom end of the second vertical slideway 105 to a right end of the third slideway 103, as shown in FIG. 2. In this way, it may be ensured that the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b can move in the sliding grooves 10 in different manners. Motion traces of ends of the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b are represented by arrows in FIGS. 2 and 3. In some embodiments, a bottom of the second slideway 102 is in flush with a bottom of the second vertical slideway 105. Alternatively, the second slideway 102 is disposed below the first slideway 101 parallelly, and the third slideway 103 is extended in the left and right direction and is aligned with the first slideway 101. In other words, extension directions of the third slideway 103 and the first slideway 101 are in a same straight line, such as a horizontal line. Therefore, it is more convenient to adjust the positions and angles of corresponding ends of the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b. Certainly, the extension directions of the third slideway 103 and the first slideway 101 may be parallel with each other, but not in a same straight line. In some embodiments, the third slideway 103 is adjacent to and is spaced from the second vertical slideway 105, and an extension length of the third slideway 103 is substantially equal to that of the first slideway 101. In an embodiment, the second slideway 102 is adjacent to the second vertical slideway 105 and is spaced from the first vertical slideway 104 and the second vertical slideway 105 respectively. In some embodiments, a length of the second slideway 102 is less than that of the first slideway 101, as shown in FIGS. 12-19. In another embodiment of the present invention, the length of the second slideway 102 is equal to that of the first slideway 101, the second slideway 102 is communicated with the first vertical slideway 104 and is spaced from the second vertical slideway 105, as shown in FIGS. 4a-6b, in which a separator 11 is provided at an end of the second slideway 102 close to a bottom of the second vertical slideway 105. By disposing the separator 11, the end of the bracket 2 can move within the sliding groove in different manners, and thus the tray 200 may be arranged with different angles and in different positions. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the separator 11 is provided at the end of the second slideway 102 close to the bottom of the second vertical slideway 105. Therefore, the first slideway 101 is communicated with the second vertical slideway 105, and the second slideway 102 is spaced from the second vertical slideway 105, i.e., the ends of the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b cannot move from the second slideway 102 to the second vertical slideway 105 directly or from the second vertical slideway 105 to the second slideway 102 directly. In some embodiments, the separator 11 and the supporting frame 1 are formed integrally. As shown in FIGS. 2, 3, 12 and 13, in a further embodiment of the present invention, each end of the first slideway 101 is provided with a positioning protrusion 12, which is configured to stop a movement of a corresponding end of the first or second bracket, and the corresponding end of the first or second bracket may be released from a stop effect of the positioning protrusion 12 when an external force is acted on the first or second bracket and may slide in the first vertical slideway 104 and the second vertical slideway 105. In other words, with the positioning protrusion 12, the first end 21a of the first bracket 2a and the first end 21b of the second bracket 2b may be restricted within the first slideway 101, instead of sliding into the first vertical slideway 104 and the second vertical slideway 105, thus implementing a positioning of the corresponding bracket so as to position the tray 200. However, the first end 21a of the first bracket 2a and the first end 21b of the second bracket 2b may be slidden into the first vertical slideway 104 or the second vertical slideway 105, when an external force is acted on the first or second bracket. As shown in FIGS. 1-19, the supporting frame 1 is configured to have a substantial box-like structure, and each of the front frame and the rear frame of the supporting frame 1 is formed by at least two horizontal supporting bars spaced from each other in an up and down direction. Alternatively, the supporting bar 13 is a steel wire. In an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 1-9, two supporting plates 110 opposite to and spaced from each other are provided to the supporting frame 1, and each sliding groove 10 is formed in a corresponding supporting plate 110 respectively. In an embodiment of the present invention as shown in FIG. 1, the two supporting plates 110 are spaced from and parallel with each other in a front and rear direction. The sliding groove 10 is formed in each of opposite surfaces of the two supporting plates 110, and the sliding groove 10 includes the first slideway 101 and the second slideway 102 spaced from each other in the up and down direction, and a third slideway 103 in a same horizontal plane with the first slideway 101, in which the third slideway 103 is spaced from the first slideway 101, i.e., the first slideway 101 is not communicated with the third slideway 103. Alternatively, two horizontal supporting bars are provided. The two supporting plates 110 have a connection structure 43, and one of the two supporting plates 110 is mounted at a front side of the supporting frame 1 by the connection structure 43 and the other of the two supporting plates 110 is mounted at a rear side of the supporting frame 1 by the connection structure 43. In an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 1, 8 and 9, the connection structure 43 includes: a plurality of hooks 431 and a plurality of connection grooves 432. The plurality of hooks 431 are adapted to fit with the upmost horizontal supporting bar 13 and is disposed on an outer side of an upper part of the supporting plate 110, and the plurality of connection grooves 432 are adapted to fit with the downmost horizontal supporting bar 13 and disposed on a bottom of the supporting plate 110. Alternatively, the plurality of hooks 431 are distributed evenly on the supporting plate 110 in the left and right direction and spaced from one another, and the plurality of connection grooves 432 are distributed evenly on the supporting plate 110 in the left and right direction and spaced from one another. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the tray supporting apparatus 110 further includes a plurality of sliding members 3, and the plurality of sliding members 3 are slidably disposed in the sliding groove 10 and at least connected with the front end and the rear end of the bracket respectively, and thus the bracket 2 can be driven to slide between the two supporting plates 110. Alternatively, the sliding member 3 is configured as a pulley and rotatably connected with the corresponding end of the bracket 2, as shown in FIG. 7. In an embodiment of the present invention, a first end of the pulley is pre-mounted into the sliding groove 10 and a second end of the pulley defines an inserting hole 31, and a corresponding end of the bracket 2 is adapted to be snapped into the inserting hole 31. In some embodiments, a gap (not shown) is formed in a peripheral wall of the inserting hole 31 so as to form an elastic inserting structure, and thus the corresponding end of the bracket 2 is able to be rotated therein without separating from the inserting hole 31 when being inserted into the inserting hole 31. In other embodiments of the present invention, as shown in FIGS. 10-19, the sliding groove 10 is defined by the supporting bar 13 at a corresponding side of the supporting frame 1 directly. Alternatively, as shown in FIGS. 10-12, the front ends and rear ends of the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b are provided with a plurality of mounting hooks 21, and the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b are mounted on the supporting frame 1 by the plurality of mounting hooks 21. Furthermore, the tray supporting apparatus 100 further includes a roller assembly 5, and the roller assembly 5 is disposed on the supporting frame 1 to move the supporting frame. As shown in FIGS. 1, 8, 9 and 10, the roller assembly 5 is disposed at each of the right side and the left side of the supporting frame 1, such that the supporting frame 1 can be driven to move within a sliding groove formed in an inner wall of a cleaning chamber in the dishwasher, and thus the tray supporting apparatus 100 can be put into or removed out from the cleaning chamber. The first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b of the tray supporting apparatus 100 according to embodiments of the present invention may have a plurality of position states, and some important positions thereof will be described in the following with reference to FIGS. 4a-6b and 14-19. In a first position state, as shown in FIG. 4b, the first bracket 2a and the second bracket 2b are configured to form a substantially V shape from a view of the front side of the tray supporting apparatus 100.
