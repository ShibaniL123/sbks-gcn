TECHNICAL FIELD This present technology generally relates to systems, devices, and methods related to golf clubs, and more specifically to metal wood clubs including a hosel incorporating a hosel rib. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED TECHNOLOGY Multi-piece construction metal wood golf clubs generally include a plurality of pieces which are joined together to form a golf club head. One of those pieces includes the hosel, the portion of the golf club head configured to receive the shaft of the golf club. In some golf club heads, the plurality of pieces also includes a face cup, a crown, and a sole. The plurality of pieces can be welded together to form the golf club head. Lie angle, face angle, and loft angle, are a few characteristics of a golf club head which a manufacturer desires to keep within tolerance during manufacturing. The lie angle of any golf club is the angle formed between the center of the shaft and the ground line of the golf club when the club is soled in its proper playing position. Face angle is the angle of the face of the club relative to the target. If the club head is “square,” the clubface will be directly facing the target on address. A “closed” face will be aligned to the left of the target (for right-handed players). If it is “open,” the face will be aligned to the right of the target. Loft angle is a measurement, in degrees, of the angle at which the face of the club lies relative to a perfectly vertical face. Using a club with a high loft angle will typically result in a golf shot with a high initial trajectory. In contrast, utilizing a club with a low loft angle will typically result in a golf shot with a low initial trajectory. Devices have been developed for bending the hosel of the golf club head. The devices generally include some form of vise or clamp and may include a bending tool and/or gauge to measure the angle or bend in at least one axis or plane. U.S. Pat. No. 6,260,250 generally discloses a bending plate to be used in conjunction with a conventional clamping apparatus in order to apply force to the hosel region of the club head in order to vary the lie and/or loft angle of the golf club head. As discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,260,250, the force to the hosel is applied using a tool well known in the golf club manufacturing industry. SUMMARY The systems, methods, and devices described herein have innovative aspects, no single one of which is indispensable or solely responsible for their desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of the claims, some of the advantageous features will now be summarized. One aspect of the present technology is the realization that during welding of the golf club head, portions of the golf club head can distort, causing face angle, loft, and lie angle to be out of specification. As a result, the hosel needs to be bent relative to the rest of the golf club head after welding in order for face angle, loft, and lie angle to fall within specification. In addition, some golf club head constructions can preferably include a hosel rib bridging the gap between a portion of the hosel and a portion of the golf club head. However, a hosel rib can limit the bending of the hosel relative to the golf club head after welding. Thus, there exists a need for an improved golf club head design incorporating a hosel rib but allowing for bending of the hosel relative to the rest of the golf club head after welding. The present technology is directed to systems, devices, and methods related to golf clubs, and more specifically to metal wood clubs including a hosel with a rib extending from a portion of the hosel. The construction of the golf club head incorporates a hosel rib construction providing the ability to bend the hosel relative to the rest of the golf club head after welding the multi-piece golf club head together.

Features of the present disclosure will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. After considering this discussion, and particularly after reading the section entitled “Detailed Description” one will understand how the illustrated features serve to explain certain principles of the present disclosure. Embodiments described herein generally relate to systems, devices, and methods related to golf clubs, and more specifically to metal wood clubs including a hosel with a hosel rib extending from a portion of the hosel. FIGS. 1-4 illustrate one embodiment of a golf club head 100. The golf club head 100 includes a crown 200, a sole 300, a striking face 400, and a hosel 500. The hosel 500 is the portion of the golf club head 100 configured to receive the shaft of the golf club, coupling the shaft to the golf club head 100. The hosel 500 can include a shaft bore 505 configured to receive a portion of the shaft. The hosel 500 is generally located on the heel side 10 of the golf club head 100 which is opposite the toe side 20. The striking face 400 is located at the front of the golf club head 100 and is configured to impact the golf ball when the golf club is swung. The sole 300 is located at the bottom of the golf club head 100 and the crown 200 is located at the top of the golf club head 100. The golf club head 100 includes an aft portion 30 at the rear of the golf club head 100 opposite the striking face 400. In some embodiments, the golf club head 1100 can comprise a multi-piece construction, meaning that the golf club head 1100 comprises a plurality of pieces, which may include for example a face cup 1700, sole 1300, crown, and hosel 1500, which are formed separately, and then joined together to form a golf club head 1100, which can be referred to as a marriage. FIGS. 5-14 illustrate embodiments of a golf club head 1100 comprising multi-piece construction. It is important to note that the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 5-14 do not illustrate the crown of the golf club head 1100 to provide an uninhibited view of the club head interior 1650 and to highlight the various inventive concepts described herein. In the embodiments illustrated, the golf club head 1100 is formed from four pieces, a face cup 1700, a hosel 1500, a sole 1300, and a crown (not illustrated). The crown comprises the top portion of the golf club head 1100, the sole 1300 comprises the bottom portion of the golf club head 1100, the face cup 1700 comprises the striking face 1400 as well as an upper face cup return 1720 and a lower face cup return 1710, and the hosel 1500 is configured to receive the shaft of the club. The hosel 1500 comprises an external portion 1510 which extends outside the golf club head 1100 and an internal portion 1520 which extends into the golf club head interior 1650. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIGS. 5-14, the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 is welded to the shell engaging hosel portion 1530 of the hosel 1500, which generally separates the external portion 1510 of the hosel 1500 from the internal portion 1520 of the hosel 1500. In additional embodiments, the golf club head 1100 can comprise additional constructions which may include for example, two piece construction, three piece construction, four piece construction, five piece construction, etc. FIG. 15 illustrates one embodiment of a method of constructing a golf club head 1100, which is outlined in more detail below. The various pieces of the golf club head 1100 can be made from a variety of materials which may include, for example, titanium, steel, aluminum, composite materials such as carbon fiber, etc. The various pieces of the golf club head 1100 can be formed using a variety of techniques which may include, for example, casting, forging, stamping, machining, sintering, vacuum infusion, autoclaving, etc. The marriage of the golf club head 1100 can comprise joining the various pieces of the club head together using a variety of techniques which may include, for example, welding, swaging, brazing, mechanical locking structures, bonding agents such as adhesives, epoxies, resins, etc. Welding, when utilized herein, refers to joining a plurality of structures via melting at least a portion of each structure forming a molten pool which becomes a strong joint once the pool cools. Welding can utilize various sources of heat which may include, for example, a gas flame, an electric arc, a laser, an electron beam, friction, ultrasound, etc. One of the primary goals of golf club manufacturing is ensuring that characteristics of the golf club head 1100 which may include for example, lie angle, face angle, and loft angle, remain within tolerance during manufacturing. In some cases, during manufacture, the hosel 1500 may not be oriented within tolerance relative to the rest of the golf club head 1100. The rest of the golf club head 1100 can be referred to as the shell 1600 and can include the striking face 1400, sole 1300, and crown. Often, such errors are due to movement or deformation of the various pieces of the club head 1100 during their marriage to form the golf club head 1100. In some embodiments, the characteristics of the golf club head 1100 including lie angle, face angle, and loft angle, can move outside the tolerated range during the marriage of the various pieces of the golf club head, particularly when they are welded together. Thus, after the marriage of the various pieces of the golf club head 1100, the orientation of the hosel 1500 often must be manipulated relative to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 to ensure the golf club head 1100 is within specification. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 5, the internal portion 1520 of the hosel 1500 does not engage the shell 1600 directly. In some embodiments, the hosel 1500 only directly engages the shell 1600 at the shell engaging hosel portion 1530, providing some flexibility between the hosel 1500 and the shell 1600 and allowing for some manipulation of the hosel 1500 relative to the shell 1600 after affixing the hosel 1500 to the shell 1600 at the shell engaging hosel portion 1530. In some embodiments, including those illustrated in FIGS. 5-10, the golf club head can include a hosel rib 1550. The hosel rib 1550 can comprise an extension of material from the hosel 1500 to bridge the gap between a portion of the hosel 1500 and a portion of the golf club head 1100, which may include for example the shell 1600. The internal portion of the hosel 1520 can then indirectly engage the shell 1600 via the hosel rib 1550 as illustrated in FIG. 10. In some embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 can engage the sole 1300 of the golf club head 1100. In some embodiments, in a five piece construction for example which includes a skirt between the sole and the crown, the hosel rib 1550 can engage the skirt of the golf club head 1100. In additional embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 could engage the striking face 1400, the crown 1200, etc. The hosel rib 1550 can promote additional strength and stiffness between the hosel 1500 and the shell 1600 of the golf club head. The hosel rib 1550 can be particularly useful for altering the acoustic qualities of the golf club head 1100 as it impacts a golf ball. Golfers have become accustomed to particular acoustic sounds for various types of golf clubs. The hosel rib 1550 can allow a golf club manufacturer to manipulate the acoustic characteristics of a golf club to produce a desirable sound by manipulating for example, the frequencies and/or amplitude at which various portions of the golf club head 1100 vibrate when the golf club head 1100 strikes a golf ball. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 5, the hosel rib 1550 can extend out from the internal portion 1520 of the hosel 1500. The hosel rib 1550 can extend substantially towards the heel 1010 of the golf club head 1100. In some embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 can extend towards other portions of the shell 1600 which may include for example, the striking face 1400, the sole 1300, the aft portion 1030 of the golf club head 1100, the crown, etc. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIGS. 5-8, the hosel rib 1550 comprises a substantially rectangular cross section. In other embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 can comprise cross sectional shapes which may include for example, square, triangular, circular, ovular, organic shapes, etc. In some embodiments, the golf club head 1100 can comprise a plurality of hosel ribs 1550. The hosel rib 1550 can be integrally formed with the hosel 1500. In other embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 can be affixed to the hosel 1500 by a variety of techniques which may include for example, welding, swaging, brazing, mechanical locking structures, bonding agents such as adhesives, epoxies, resins, etc. The hosel rib 1550 can be affixed to a portion of the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 as well, which may include for example, the sole 1300. In some embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 can be affixed to a portion of the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 during the same stage of construction as the marriage of the golf club head 1100. One problem with a hosel rib 1550 which is affixed to both the hosel 1500 and the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100, is that adjusting the hosel 1500 orientation relative to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 after joining the various pieces of the golf club head 1100 together, becomes difficult due to the inflexibility of the hosel 1500 relative to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100. In some embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 is not affixed to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 during the marriage of the golf club head 1100, thus maintaining some flexibility between the hosel 1500 and the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100. The hosel 1500 can then be manipulated relative to the shell 1600 after the marriage to achieve the desired golf club characteristics. The problem then becomes, affixing the hosel rib 1550 to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 after the marriage, as the marriage may have made it difficult or impossible to access the golf club head interior 1650. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIGS. 5-7, the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 can include a rib window 1800. The rib window 1800 can be configured to receive at least a portion of the hosel rib 1550. In some embodiments, the rib window 1800 can be formed through the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100. The rib window 1800 can be formed through the sole 1600 of the golf club head 1100. The rib window 1800 can be formed through a portion of the heel 1010 of the golf club head 1100. The hosel rib 1550 can be dimensioned such that when the hosel 1500 is affixed to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100, a portion of the hosel rib 1550 extends into the rib window 1800. In some embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 can be dimensioned such that when the hosel 1500 is affixed to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100, a portion of the hosel rib 1550 extends through the rib window 1800 extending outside the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100, as illustrated in FIG. 7. The rib window 1800 can be dimensioned such that the hosel rib 1550 can be manipulated relative to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 after the marriage of the various pieces of the golf club head 1100, with the hosel rib 1550 moving relative to the rib window 1800 as the hosel 1500 is bent into the desired orientation. In other embodiments, the hosel rib 1550 may not pass through the rib window 1800, but the rib window 1800 may provide a window to affix the hosel rib 1550 to the shell 1600. In some embodiments, the shell 1600 can include multiple rib windows 1800. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 8, once the manipulation of the hosel 1500 has been completed and is within specification, the hosel rib 1550 can be affixed to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 8, affixing the hosel rib 1550 to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 can include welding the hosel rib 1550 to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100, forming a weld bead 1850. The welding process can fill in any remaining portions of the rib window 1800 not filled by the hosel rib 1550, eliminating any gaps between the hosel rib 1550 and the shell 1600. Then, in some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 9, excess weld bead 1850 formed by welding the hosel rib 1550 to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 as well as any portion of the hosel rib 1550 extending outside the outer surface of the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 can be removed via a finishing process. In some embodiments, the finishing process can include one or a combination of techniques which may include, for example, grinding, polishing, sanding, cutting etc. The rib window 1800, portion of the hosel rib 1550 extending through the rib window 1800, and excess weld bead 1850, can then be replaced by a polished area 1870 as illustrated in FIG. 10. In some embodiments, the polished area 1870 can appear consistent with the rest of the shell 1600, with any immediately apparent evidence of the hosel rib 1550 and weld bead 1850 removed by the finishing process. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 11, rather than including a rib window, the shell 1600 can include a plurality of affixation ports 1900. In some embodiments, the affixation ports 1900 can comprise holes formed through the shell 1600. The affixation ports 1900 can be circular in cross section. The affixation ports 1900 can allow the hosel rib 1550 to be affixed to the shell 1600 after the marriage of the shell 1600 and after the manipulation of the hosel 1500 has been completed and is within specification. The plurality of affixation ports 1900 can be positioned such that hosel rib 1550 is within an affixable proximity to at least one, and preferably several of the affixation ports 1900, even after manipulating the hosel 1500 relative to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 12, each affixation port 1900 can be utilized for a spot weld 1950. Depending on the position of the hosel rib 1550 relative to the shell 1600, one or more of the spot welds 1950 can engage the hosel rib 1550 and affix the hosel rib 1550 to the shell 1600 as illustrated in FIG. 14. Then, in some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 13, excess spot weld 1950 formed by welding the hosel rib 1550 to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 can be removed via a finishing process forming a polished area 1970. In other embodiments, affixing the hosel rib 1550 to the shell 1600 of the golf club head 1100 can include other means of fixation which may include for example, swaging, brazing, mechanical locking structures, bonding agents such as adhesives, epoxies, resins, etc. In some embodiments, one or more pieces of the golf club head 1100 including for example, the hosel 1500, the crown, the sole 1300, the striking face 1400, the hosel rib 1550, etc. can comprise a composite material which may include for example, carbon fiber. In some embodiments, the finishing process can include adding additional materials over the rib window 1800 area or affixation port 1900 area to further camouflage the existence of the rib window 1800 or affixation ports 1900. In describing the present technology herein, certain features that are described in the context of separate implementations also can be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation also can be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable sub combination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a sub combination or variation of a sub combination.
