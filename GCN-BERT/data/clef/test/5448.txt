TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a composition for promoting lipolysis. BACKGROUND In modern life, we are chronically in a high nutrient condition, and further tend to accumulate fats in our bodies due to chronic lack of exercise. Visceral fat is a tissue that secrets bad adipocytokines that increase a risk for hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and the like. Thus, materials having a function that reduces the visceral fat effortlessly have been being developed. Catechins that exert their effect by being ingested with exercise (Nonpatent Literature 1) and polyphenols that suppress absorption of fat (Nonpatent Literature 2) are reported to be available as such materials. Patent Document 1 describes that combination of lactoferrin with a blood circulation accelerator exerts an effect of reducing the visceral fat by suppressing the accumulation of fat.

The composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention exhibits a promotion effect that is excellent in breakdown of the fat. Thus, this is effective for prevention and treatment of obesity. According to the composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention, it is anticipated to reduce the visceral fat. Thus, it is anticipated to efficiently prevent and treat the lifestyle related disease such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and the like. A method for oral administration can be determined appropriately depending on conditions such as concentrations of the components (A) and (B) to be combined, the dosage form, an age, bodyweight and sex of the subject to be administered, and an exercise load when a dose is received before an exercise. For example when the dosage form is the tablet, it is preferable to take the tablet together with water and the like. A dosing interval can be determined appropriately, and the dose may be received before, after, or during a meal. The administration of one or two or more other agents or compositions for promoting the lipolysis may be combined in addition to the administration of the composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention. Alternatively, a composition including one or two or more other ingredients having the effect of promoting the lipolysis in addition to the combination of the components (A) and (B) may be made as the composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention. The lipolysis can be promoted by giving the composition for promoting the lipolysis to the human or the vertebrate other than the human. Thus, the composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention is useful as a pharmaceutical, a quasi-drug, a food product, and a feedstuff.

An ingestion time of the food product including the composition for promoting the lipolysis is not particularly limited here. For example, the food product may be ingested before or after the meal and before or after the exercise. When the composition for promoting the lipolysis is used as the food product, it is preferable to display the effect of the present invention. Examples of the display for the effect of the present invention may include the display that the food product is used for promoting the breakdown of the fat. The breakdown of the visceral fat is promoted by administering the composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention as the food products to the human as described above. Therefore, the composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention is useful as various food products for obesity prevention, weight loss, and prevention of the lifestyle related diseases. The composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention is also useful as the feedstuff because even when this is administered to the vertebrate such as a pet animal other than the human, the effect of promoting the breakdown of the visceral fat can also be anticipated. Further, the components (A) and (B) in the composition for promoting the lipolysis of the present invention can be added to an ordinary food product or feedstuff to give the effect of promoting the lipolysis to that food product or feedstuff. EXAMPLES The present invention will be described in detail below based on Examples. The present invention is not limited to these Examples. Experimental Examples 1 to 9 and Comparative Experimental Examples 1 to 4 Preparation of Rat Mesenteric Adipocytes Two SD rats (male, 10 weeks of age, Japan SLC, Inc.) were used. The rats were euthanized under anesthesia with ether and anatomized, and mesenteric adipose tissue was removed. The obtained tissue was placed in a sterilized petri dish, immersed in ice-cold saline (Otsuka Normal Saline, supplied from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) containing 1% antibiotic (Antibiotic-Antimycotic Stabilized, supplied from Sigma, A5955), and washed to remove blood and hairs, particularly lymphocytes (washed several times with different saline until no hair was visible). The tissue was cut using ophthalmic scissors (cut 25 times per 1 g of the tissue), and dispersed by stirring every several minutes in a PBS solution containing 1 mg/mL of collagenase (Collagenase S-1 derived from Actinomycetes, supplied from Nitta Gelatin Inc.) at 37° C. for 40 minutes. Roughly, the tissue from one rat was treated with 20 mL of the collagenase solution. The tissue suspension was filtrated through a cell strainer with a pore size of 100 μm (REF352360 supplied from BD Falcon). Subsequently, a viscosity of the suspension was reduced by adding 20 mL of DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium-high glucose, D5796 supplied from Sigma), and then the suspension was centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 minutes. An oil layer in an upper layer was removed using an aspirator, and then, the resulting suspension was resuspended and filtrated through a cell strainer with a pore size of 70 μm (REF352350 supplied from BD Falcon). After centrifuging at 800 rpm for 15 minutes, it was confirmed that there was no suspended cell in a supernatant, the presence of a pellet was confirmed, and then the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in 5 mL of DMEM (serum free), the suspension was centrifuged at 800 rpm for 15 minutes, and then the supernatant was removed. The resulting pellet was gently suspended in 5 mL of a medium for visceral adipocyte differentiation (Visceral Adipocyte Culture Medium, 250 mL, code: VACMR supplied from Primary Cell Co., Ltd.). The suspension was diluted to 10 times, and the number of cells was counted and was 1.015×107 cells/mL. 2.54×107 cells could be recovered from one rat. The cells suspended in the medium were placed so as to be at 6×106 cells/24-wells and 500 μL/well, and their cultivation was started. On the following day, 500 μL of the medium was added, and subsequently the medium was changed every third day. Thereafter, the medium was changed every third day. On the 6th day after the start of the cultivation, the medium was changed to a medium containing each sample. A culture supernatant was collected 48 hours after adding the sample, and the cultivation was terminated. It was visually confirmed that there was no cytotoxicity in all of the cultivations. Preparation of Sample Samples used in each Example and Comparative Example were prepared. Lactoferrin (supplied from DMV), raspberry ketone (supplied from Takasago International Corporation), an artichoke leaf extract (brand name: Biobenefity F supplied from Ichimaru Pharcos Co., Ltd.), a cacao extract (Cacao extract-P supplied from Oryza Oil & Fat Chemical Co., Ltd.), a grape seed extract (brand name: Gravinol supplied from Kikkoman Corporation), a pine bark extract (Enzogenol supplied from Enzo Nutraceuticals Limited), a Coleus forskohlii extract (supplied from Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd.), a Durvillaea extract, a rosemary extract (brand name: Leomeal supplied from Lion Corporation), soybean isoflavone aglycone (supplied from Kikkoman Corporation), a ginger extract (supplied from Nippon Funmatsu Yakuhin Co., Ltd.), epigallocatechin gallate (supplied from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.), and chlorogenic acid (supplied from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) were used as ingredients in the samples. Biobenefity F used as the artichoke leaf extract contains dextrin in an amount of 70% by mass as the diluent, but an amount of the combined artichoke leaf extract in Table 1 is a value in terms of removing the diluent. The Durvillaea extract was extracted under the following condition. The Durvillaea extract was obtained by stirring 10 g of dried Durvillaea in aqueous ethanol (alcohol/water=30/70 (v/v)) in 20 times its weight for 3 hours and then distilling off its supernatant. A concentration of lactoferrin was adjusted to 30 ppm or 10 ppm, and lactoferrin at each concentration was used as the sample for evaluating the effect of lactoferrin alone (Comparative Experimental example 1). Each ingredient other than lactoferrin was used as the sample for evaluating the effect of a single preparation alone as follows. Lactoferrin and each ingredient other than lactoferrin were adjusted to the following concentrations and mixed to use as the sample for evaluating the effect of a combined preparation (Experimental Examples 1 to 9 and Comparative Experimental Examples 2 to 4). (Samples for Evaluating Single Preparation) Each ingredient other than lactoferrin: 30 ppm Each ingredient other than lactoferrin: 10 ppm (Samples for Evaluating Combined Preparation (+Lactoferrin 30 ppm)) Each ingredient other than lactoferrin: 30 ppm+lactoferrin 30 ppm Each ingredient other than lactoferrin: 10 ppm+lactoferrin 30 ppm (Samples for Evaluating Combined Preparation (+Lactoferrin 10 ppm)) Each ingredient other than lactoferrin: 30 ppm+lactoferrin 10 ppm Each ingredient other than lactoferrin: 10 ppm+lactoferrin 10 ppm Quantification of Glycerol Concentration Glycerol was quantified using F-Kit Glycerol (product No. 14820 supplied from Roche). Absorbance was measured using Novaspec Plus (supplied from Amersham Bioscience). 1.0 mL of a solution I dissolved in 11 mL of distilled water, 2.0 mL of distilled water, 0.1 mL of each sample described above, and 0.01 mL of a solution II were added. The mixture was mixed well, and reacted at room temperature for 5 minutes. The absorbance at AB 340 nm (E1) was measured. 0.01 mL of a solution III was added thereto. The mixture was mixed well and reacted at room temperature for 7 minutes. Then, the absorbance (E2) was measured. Standard solutions included in the kit were used as controls. The concentration of glycerol was calculated based on the measured absorbance values by the following calculation formula I according to attached instructions. [in-line-formulae]Glycerol (g/L)=V×MW/ε×d×v×1000×δE×dilution rate (Calculation formula I)[/in-line-formulae] δE=(E2−E1)sample−(E2−E1)blank V (amount of reaction solution): 3.02 mL MW (molecular weight): 92.1 d (optical path length): 1 cm ε (absorbance coefficient): 6.3 (1×mmol−1×cm−1) v (amount of specimen): 0.1 mL (Calculation of Glycerol Concentration Based on Calculation Formula I) [in-line-formulae]Glycerol (g/L)=3.02×92.1/6.3×1×0.1×1000×δE=0.441×δE×dilution rate[/in-line-formulae] A relative amount of glycerol in each of Experimental Examples and Comparative Experimental Examples was calculated when an amount of glycerol in an additive free group was 0%, and the relative amount was described as a rate of promoting the lipolysis. The rate of promoting the lipolysis in each of Experimental Examples and Comparative Experimental Examples is shown in Table 1-1 (evaluation of single preparations), Table 1-2 (evaluation of combined preparations (combined with lactoferrin 30 ppm)), and Table 1-3 (evaluation of combined preparations (combined with lactoferrin 10 ppm)). Results As shown in Table 1, the rates of promoting the lipolysis in the evaluation of the combined preparations in Experimental Examples 1 to 9 exceeded the values obtained by adding the rates of promoting the lipolysis in the evaluation of the single preparations at corresponding concentration. To cite a case, the rate of promoting the lipolysis 32% in Experimental Example 9 in the combined preparation (isoflavone 10 ppm+lactoferrin 10 ppm in Table 1-3) exceeded a value obtained by adding the rate of promoting the lipolysis 12.1% (Table 1-1) obtained from lactoferrin 10 ppm alone in Comparative Experimental Example 1 in the single preparation and the rate of promoting the lipolysis 0% obtained from isoflavone alone in Experimental Example 9 in the single preparation. To cite another case, raspberry ketone (Experimental Example 1) alone and the pine bark extract (Experimental example 5) alone rather inhibited the lipolysis at 10 ppm in the single preparation (Table 1-1), but each of them in combination with lactoferrin 10 ppm exhibited unexpectedly the more excellent effect of promoting the lipolysis than in the case of lactoferrin 10 ppm alone (Table 1-3). On the other hand, the rate of promoting the lipolysis in Comparative Experimental Example 2 in each combined preparation was below a value obtained by adding the rate of promoting the lipolysis in Comparative Experimental Example 2 in the single preparation and the rate of promoting the lipolysis in Comparative Experimental Example 1 in the single preparation. No prominently synergistic effect as seen in Experimental Examples 1 to 9 was observed also in Comparative Experimental Examples 3 and 4. These results indicate that the synergistic effect is exerted and the unexpectedly prominent effect of promoting the lipolysis is exerted by combining the component (A) and the component (B) in the present invention.

Results are shown in Table 2. As is evident from Table 2, the rates of promoting the lipolysis in Experimental Examples 10 to 13 greatly exceeded values obtained by adding the rates of promoting the lipolysis of the respective ingredients that composed each Experimental Example in the single preparation (see Table 1-1). On the contrary, the rates of promoting the lipolysis in Comparative Experimental Examples 5 to 7 were below the value obtained by adding the rates of promoting the lipolysis of the respective ingredients that composed each Experimental Example in the single preparation (see Table 1-1). These results indicate that the component (B) that is the combination of two or more substances in the composition of the present invention also exerts the synergistic effect of the component (A) and the component (B) and exerts the unexpectedly prominent effect of promoting the lipolysis in the same manner as when the component (B) is the single substance.
