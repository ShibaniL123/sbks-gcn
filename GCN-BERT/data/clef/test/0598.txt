Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
(R)-3-(2-((2,2-Difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (490 mg, 1.80 mmol) and 4-bromo-2-methoxybenzaldehyde (813 mg, 3.78 mmol) were heated in acetic acid (8.8 mL) and water (0.162 mL, 9.00 mmol) to 75° C. overnight. After cooling, the acetic acid was evaporated under vacuum, then the residue was dissolved in EtOAc (20 mL) and 2N HCl solution (20 mL) was added. The biphasic mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, then the layers were separated. The organic phase was extracted with water, then the aqueous phase was basified by addition of 2N NaOH solution and extracted with DCM (×2). The combined DCM layers were dried and evaporated, then the crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (384 mg, 46%) as a beige solid.
