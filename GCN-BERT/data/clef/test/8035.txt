This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/450,156 filed on Mar. 8, 2011, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. The present invention relates to a process for preparing alkanolamines by homogeneously catalyzed alcohol amination of diols by means of ammonia with elimination of water in the presence of a complex catalyst which comprises at least one element selected from groups 8, 9 and 10 of the Periodic Table and also at least one phosphorus donor ligand. Alkanolamines are compounds which have a primary amino group (—NH2) and a hydroxyl group (—OH). Alkanolamines are valuable products having many different uses, for example solvents, stabilizers, for the synthesis of chelating agents, as starting materials for the production of synthetic resins, drugs, inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, polyurethanes, as hardeners for epoxy resins, as surface-active substances and for gas scrubbing. The amination of diols by means of secondary amines using homogeneous iridium and ruthenium catalysts to form amino alcohols and linear diamines having tertiary amino groups has been described, for example, in EP 239 934; J.

Dev. 2010, 14, 1046-1049 describe the amination of diols by means of primary amines using homogeneously dissolved ruthenium- and iridium-based transition metal catalysts. However, the cyclic compounds and not the desired alkanolamines are formed here. The economically attractive amination of diols by means of ammonia to form alkanolamines has not been described for these systems. EP 0 234 401 A1 describes the reaction of ethylene glycol with ammonia in the presence of a ruthenium carbonyl compound. In the process described in EP 0 234 401 A1, the monoamination product (monoethanolamine) is formed among other things. In addition, large amounts of the secondary and tertiary amines (diethanolamine and triethanolamine) and cyclic products (N-(hydroxyethyl)piperazine and N,N′-bis(hydroxyethyl)piperazine) are formed as by-products. All the above-described processes for the reaction of diols have the disadvantage that undesired secondary, tertiary and cyclic amines are formed to a major extent in addition to the desired alkanolamines. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing alkanolamines by alcohol amination of diols by means of ammonia with elimination of water. The object is achieved by a process for preparing alkanolamines which have a primary amino group (—NH2) and a hydroxyl group (—OH) by alcohol amination of diols having two hydroxyl groups (—OH) by means of ammonia with elimination of water, wherein the reaction is carried out homogeneously catalyzed in the presence of at least one complex catalyst comprising at least one element selected from groups 8, 9 and 10 of the Periodic Table and also at least one phosphorus donor ligand. It has surprisingly been found that alkanolamines can be obtained by the homogeneously catalyzed amination of diols by means of ammonia with elimination of water using the complex catalysts which are used in the process of the invention and comprise at least one element selected from groups 8, 9 and 10 of the Periodic Table and also at least one phosphorus donor ligand. The process of the invention has the advantage that it gives alkanolamines in considerably improved yields compared to the processes described in the prior art. In addition, the formation of undesired by-products such as secondary and tertiary amines and also cyclic amines is largely avoided. Starting Materials In the process of the invention, starting materials having two hydroxyl groups are used. Suitable starting materials are virtually all diols which meet the above-mentioned prerequisites. The diols can be straight-chain, branched or cyclic. The alcohols can also bear substituents which are inert under the reaction conditions of the alcohol amination, for example alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino and halogens (F, Cl, Br, I). Suitable starting materials which can be used in the process of the invention are, for example, diols which have a functional group of the formula (—CH2—OH) and a further hydroxyl group (—OH).

The abovementioned definition of C3-C10-cycloalkyl applies analogously to C3-C10-cycloalkane. Alcohol Amination The homogeneous catalysts can be produced either directly in their active form or only under the reaction conditions from customary precursors with addition of the appropriate ligands. Customary precursors are, for example, [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, [Ru(benzene)Cl2]n, [Ru(CO)2Cl2]n, [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2 [Ru(COD)(allyl)], [RuCl3*H2O], [Ru(acetylacetonate)3], [Ru(DMSO)4Cl2], [Ru(PPh3)3(CO)(H)Cl], [Ru(PPh3)3(CO)Cl2], [Ru(PPh3)3(CO)(H)2], [Ru(PPh3)3Cl2], [Ru(cyclopentadienyl)(PPh3)2Cl], [Ru(cyclopentadienyl)(CO)2Cl], [Ru(cyclopentadienyl)(CO)2H], [Ru(cyclopentadienyl)(CO)2]2, [Ru(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(CO)2]2, [Ru(penta-methylcylcopentadienyl)(CO)2H], [Ru(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(CO)2]2, [Ru(indenyl)(CO)2Cl], [Ru(indenyl)(CO)2H], [Ru(indenyl)(CO)2]2, ruthenocene, [Ru(binap)Cl2], [Ru(bipyridine)2Cl2*2H2O], [Ru(COD)Cl2]2, [Ru(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(COD)Cl], [Ru3(CO)12], [Ru(tetraphenylhydroxycyclopentadienyl)(CO)2H], [Ru(PMe3)4(H)2], [Ru(PEt3)4(H)2], [Ru(PnPr3)4(H)2], [Ru(PnBu3)4(H)2], [Ru(PnOctyl3)4(H)2], [IrCl3*H2O], KIrCl4, K3IrCl6, [Ir(COD)Cl]2, [Ir(cyclooctene)2Cl]2, [Ir(ethene)2C1]2, [Ir(cyclopentadienyl)Cl2]2, [Ir(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)Cl2]2, [Ir(cylopentadienyl)(CO)2], [Ir(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)(CO)2], [Ir(PPh3)2(CO)(H)], [Ir(PPh3)2(CO)(Cl)], [Ir(PPh3)3(Cl)]. For the purposes of the present invention, homogeneously catalyzed means that the catalytically active part of the complex catalyst is at least partly present in solution in the liquid reaction medium. In a preferred embodiment, at least 90% of the complex catalyst used in the process is present in solution in the liquid reaction medium, more preferably at least 95%, particularly preferably more than 99%; the complex catalyst is most preferably entirely present in solution in the liquid reaction medium (100%), in each case based on the total amount in the liquid reaction medium. The amount of the metal component of the catalyst, preferably ruthenium or iridium, is generally from 0.1 to 5000 ppm by weight, in each case based on the total liquid reaction medium. The reaction occurs in the liquid phase, generally at a temperature of from 20 to 250° C. The process of the invention is preferably carried out at temperatures in the range from 100° C. to 200° C., particularly preferably in the range from 110 to 160° C. The reaction can generally be carried out at a total pressure of from 0.1 to 20 MPa absolute, which can be either the autogenous pressure of the solvent at the reaction temperature or the pressure of a gas such as nitrogen, argon or hydrogen. The process of the invention is preferably carried out at a total pressure in the range from 0.2 to 15 MPa absolute, particularly preferably at a total pressure in the range from 1 to 15 MPa absolute. The average reaction time is generally from 15 minutes to 100 hours. The aminating agent (ammonia) can be used in stoichiometric, substoichiometric or superstoichiometric amounts based on the hydroxyl groups to be aminated. In a preferred embodiment, ammonia is used in a from 1- to 250-fold, preferably a from 1- to 100-fold, in particular in a from 1.5- to 10-fold, molar excess per mole of hydroxyl groups to be reacted in the starting material. Higher excesses of ammonia are also possible. The ammonia can be introduced in gaseous form, liquid form or as a solution in the solvent or starting material. The process of the invention can be carried out either in a solvent or without solvent. Suitable solvents are polar and nonpolar solvents which can be used in pure form or in mixtures. For example, it is possible to use only one nonpolar or one polar solvent in the process of the invention. It is also possible to use mixtures of two or more polar solvents or mixtures of two or more nonpolar solvents or mixtures of one or more polar solvents with one or more nonpolar solvents. The product can also be used as solvent, either in pure form or in mixtures with polar or nonpolar solvents. Suitable nonpolar solvents are, for example, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene and mesitylene and linear and cyclic ethers such as THF, diethyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, MTBE (tert-butyl methyl ether), diglyme and 1,2-dimethoxyethane. Preference is given to using toluene, xylene or mesitylene. Suitable polar solvents are, for example, water, dimethylformamide, formamide, tert-amylalcohol and acetonitrile. Preference is given to using water. The water can either be added before the reaction, be formed as water of reaction during the reaction or be added after the reaction in addition to the water of reaction. A further preferred solvent is tert-amylalcohol. To carry out the reaction in the liquid phase, ammonia, the diol optionally together with one or more solvents, together with the complex catalyst are introduced into a reactor. The introduction of ammonia, diol, optionally solvent and complex catalyst can be carried out simultaneously or separately. The reaction can be carried out continuously, in the semibatch mode, in the batch mode, admixed in product as solvent or without admixing in a single pass. It is in principle possible to use all reactors which are basically suitable for gas/liquid reactions at the given temperature and the given pressure for the process of the invention. Suitable standard reactors for gas/liquid reaction systems and for liquid/liquid reaction systems are, for example, indicated in K. D. Henkel, “Reactor Types and Their Industrial Applications”, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, DOI: 10.1002/14356007.b04—087, chapter 3.3 “Reactors for gas-liquid reactions”. Examples which may be mentioned are stirred tank reactors, tube reactors or bubble column reactors. In the amination reaction, a hydroxyl group, preferably a primary hydroxyl group (—CH2—OH), of the starting material is reacted with ammonia to form a primary amino group (—NH2), with in each case one mole of water of reaction being formed per mole of reacted hydroxyl group. The reaction of 1,2-ethylene glycol leads, for example, to the corresponding 2-aminoethanol. The reaction output formed in the reaction generally comprises the corresponding alkanolamines, the one or more solvents if used, the complex catalyst, possibly unreacted starting materials and ammonia and also the water of reaction formed. Any excess ammonia present, any solvent present, the complex catalyst and the water of reaction are removed from the reaction output. The amination product obtained can be worked up further. The excess ammonia, the complex catalyst, any solvent or solvents and any unreacted starting materials can be recirculated to the amination reaction. If the amination reaction is carried out without solvent, the homogeneous complex catalyst is dissolved in the product after the reaction. This can remain in the product or be separated off therefrom by a suitable method. Possibilities for separating off the catalyst are, for example, scrubbing with a solvent which is not miscible with the product and in which the catalyst dissolves better than in the product as a result of a suitable choice of the ligands. The catalyst concentration in the product is optionally reduced by multistage extraction. As extractant, preference is given to using a solvent which is also suitable for the target reaction, e.g. toluene, benzene, xylenes, alkanes such as hexanes, heptanes and octanes and acyclic or cyclic ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, which can after concentration by evaporation be reused together with the extracted catalyst for the reaction. It is also possible to remove the catalyst by means of a suitable absorbent. The catalyst can also be separated off by adding water to the product phase if the reaction is carried out in a solvent which is immiscible with water. If the catalyst in this case dissolves preferentially in the solvent, it can be separated off with the solvent from the aqueous product phase and optionally be reused. This can be brought about by selection of suitable ligands. The resulting aqueous diamines, triamines or polyamines can be used directly as technical-grade amine solutions. It is also possible to separate the amination product from the catalyst by distillation. If the reaction is carried out in a solvent, the latter can be miscible with the amination product and be separated off by distillation after the reaction. It is also possible to use solvents which have a miscibility gap with the amination products or the starting materials. Suitable solvents for this purpose are, for example, toluene, benzene, xylenes, alkanes such as hexanes, heptanes and octanes and acyclic or cyclic ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane. As a result of suitable choice of the phosphine ligands, the catalyst preferentially dissolves in the solvent phase. The phosphine ligands can also be selected so that the catalyst dissolves in the amination product. In this case, the amination product can be separated from the catalyst by distillation. The solvent can also be miscible with the starting materials and the product under the reaction conditions and only form a second liquid phase comprising the major part of the catalyst after cooling. As solvents which display this property, mention may be made by way of example of toluene, benzene, xylenes, alkanes such as hexanes, heptanes and octanes. The catalyst can then be separated off together with the solvent and be reused. The product phase can also be admixed with water in this variant. The proportion of the catalyst comprised in the product can subsequently be separated off by means of suitable absorbents such as polyacrylic acid and salts thereof, sulfonated polystyrenes and salts thereof, activated carbons, montmorillonites, bentonites and zeolites or else be left in the product. The amination reaction can also be carried out in a two-phase system. In the case of the two-phase reaction, suitable nonpolar solvents are, in particular, toluene, benzene, xylenes, alkanes such as hexanes, heptanes and octanes in combination with lipophilic phosphine ligands on the transition metal catalyst, as a result of which the transition metal catalyst accumulates in the nonpolar phase. In this embodiment, in which the product and the water of reaction and any unreacted starting materials form a second phase enriched with these compounds the major part of the catalyst can be separated off from the product phase by simple phase separation and be reused. If volatile by-products or unreacted starting materials or the water formed in the reaction or added after the reaction to aid the extraction are undesirable, they can be separated off from the product without problems by distillation. It can also be advantageous for the water formed in the reaction to be removed continuously from the reaction mixture. The water of reaction can be separated off from the reaction mixture directly by distillation or as azeotrope with addition of a suitable solvent (entrainer) and using a water separator or be removed by addition of water-withdrawing auxiliaries. The addition of bases can have a positive effect on product formation. Suitable bases which may be mentioned here are alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkaline metal alkoxides, alkaline earth metal alkoxides, alkali metal carbonates and alkaline earth metal carbonates, which can be used in amounts of from 0.01 to 100 molar equivalents based on the metal catalyst used.

The definitions and preferences described for the process of the invention apply to the use of the complex catalyst of the formula (XXI) for the homogeneously catalyzed preparation of alkanolamines which have a primary amino group (—NH2) and a hydroxyl group (—OH) by alcohol amination of diols having two hydroxyl groups (—OH) by means of ammonia. The invention is illustrated by the following examples without being restricted thereto. EXAMPLE General method for the catalytic amination of alcohols by means of ammonia according to the invention Ligand L, metal salt M or catalyst complex XIVb (for preparation, see below, weighed out under an inert atmosphere), solvent and the alcohol to be reacted were placed under an Ar atmosphere in a 160 ml Parr autoclave (stainless steel V4A) having a magnetically coupled inclined blade stirrer (stirring speed: 200-500 revolutions/minute). The indicated amount of ammonia was introduced at room temperature either in precondensed form or directly from the pressurized NH3 gas bottle. If hydrogen was used, this was effected by iterative differential pressure metering. The steel autoclave was electrically heated to the temperature indicated and heated for the time indicated while stirring (500 revolutions/minute) (internal temperature measurement). After cooling to room temperature, venting the autoclave and outgassing the ammonia at atmospheric pressure, the reaction mixture was analyzed by GC (30 m RTX5 amine 0.32 mm 1.5 μm). The results for the amination of 1,4-butanediol (tables 1a, 1b and 2), diethylene glycol (tables 3a, 3b and 4), monoethylene glycol (table 5) and diethanolamine (table 6), 1,5-pentanediol, 1,9-nonanediol, 1,6-hexanediol and 1,10-decanediol (table 7) and 2,5-(dimethanol)-furan (table 8) are given below. Synthesis of the Catalyst Complex XIVb a) Synthesis of 4,5-bis(dicyclohexylphosphinomethyl)acridine A solution of 4,5-bis(bromomethyl)acridine1 (5.2 g, 14.2 mmol) and dicyclohexylphosphine (8.18 g, 36.8 mmol) in 65 ml of anhydrous, degassed methanol was heated at 50° C. under an inert argon atmosphere for 66 hours. After cooling to room temperature, triethylamine (5.72 g, 56.7 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Evaporation of the solvent gave a whitish yellow solid in a red oil. Extraction by means of 3×40 ml of MTBE and concentration of the filtrate gave a reddish brown oil (1H NMR: mixture of product & HPCy2). Taking up in a little warm MTBE followed by addition of ice-cooled methanol resulted in precipitation of a yellow, microcrystalline solid. Oscillation and drying under reduced pressure gave air sensitive 4,5-bis(dicyclohexylphosphinomethyl)acridine (2.74 g, 33%) as a yellow powder. 1H NMR (360.63 MHz, d8-toluene): δ [ppm]=8.07 (s, 1H, H9), 7.91 (d, J=8.3 Hz, 2H, Ar—H), 7.42 (d, J=8.3 Hz, 2H, Ar—H), 7.21 (dd, J=8.3 Hz, J=7.2 Hz, 2H, Ar—H), 3.89 (bs, 4H, —CH2—P), 1.96-1.85 (m, 8H, Cy-H), 1.77-1.54 (m, 20H, Cy-H), 1.26-1.07 (m, 16H, Cy-H). 31P{1H} NMR (145.98 MHz, d8-toluene): δ [ppm]=2.49 (s, —CH2—P(Cy)2). b) Synthesis of the Catalyst Complex XIVb 4,5-bis(dicyclohexylphosphinomethyl)acridine (1855 mg, 3.1 mmol) and [RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3]2 (2678 mg, 2.81 mmol) were heated at 70° C. in 80 ml of degassed toluene for 2 hours. The resulting dark brown solution was evaporated to dryness, the residue was slurried in 3×20 ml of hexane and isolated by filtration. Drying under reduced pressure gave Ru-PNP Pincer complex XIVb (1603 mg, 75%) as an orange-brown powder. 1H NMR (360.63 MHz, d8-toluene): δ [ppm]=8.06 (s, 1H, H9), 7.43 (d, J=7.6 Hz, 2H, Ar—H), 7.33 (d, J=6.5 Hz, 2H, Ar—H), 7.06-7.02 (m, 2H, Ar—H), 5.02 (d, J=11.9 Hz, 2H, —CHH—PCy2), 3.54 (d, J=12.2 Hz, 2H, —CHH—PCy2), 2.87 (bs, 2H, —P(CaH(CH2)5)2), 2.54 (bs, 2H, —P(CbH(CH2)5)2), 2.18 (bs, 2H, Cy-H), 1.88-1.85 (m, 8H, Cy-H), 1.65 (bs, 6H, Cy-H), 1.42-1.35 (m, 14H, Cy-H), 1.17-0.82 (m, 12H, Cy-H), −16.29 (t, J=19.1 Hz, 1H, Ru—H). 31P{1H} NMR (145.98 MHz, d8-toluene): δ [ppm]=60.89 (s, —CH2—P(Cy)2).
