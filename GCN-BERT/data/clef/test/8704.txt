Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a novel compound and its incorporation and use as a fragrance material. Background of the Invention There is an ongoing need in the fragrance industry to provide new chemicals to give perfumers and other persons the ability to create new fragrances for perfumes, colognes and personal care products. Those with skill in the art appreciate how small differences in chemical structures can result in unexpected and significant differences in odor, notes and characteristics of molecules. These variations allow perfumers and other persons to apply new compounds in creating new fragrances. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a novel compound but-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester and its unexpected advantageous use in enhancing, improving or modifying the fragrance of perfumes, colognes, toilet waters, personal products, fabric care products, and the like. One embodiment of the present invention is directed to but-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester, a novel fragrance compound, represented by the following formula: Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to the use of but-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester as a fragrance material in perfumes, colognes, toilet waters, personal products, fabric care products, and the like. Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a fragrance composition comprising but-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester. Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a fragrance product comprising but-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester. Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of improving, enhancing or modifying a fragrance formulation by incorporating an olfactory acceptable amount of but-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester. These and other embodiments of the present invention will be apparent by reading the following specification. Detailed Description of the Invention It has been surprisingly found that but-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester possesses unexpected powerful and complex notes with a unique fruity and woody combination. But-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester of the present invention is represented by the following structure: But-2-enoic acid 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl ester can be prepared according to the following reaction scheme, the details of which are specified in the Examples. The reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company unless noted otherwise. Complexity of odor notes refers to the presence of multiple and/or mixed but defined odors rather than a single note or a few easily identifiable notes. High levels of complexity are also assigned to compounds that possess ambiguous and somehow hard-to-define notes because of direct contribution or the many olfactive combinations of odors produced. Fragrance materials of high level complexity are considered having unusual and high quality. The use of the compound of the present invention is widely applicable in current perfumery products, including the preparation of perfumes and colognes, the perfuming of personal care products such as soaps, shower gels, and hair care products, fabric care products as well as air fresheners and cosmetic preparations. This compound can also be used to perfume cleaning agents, such as, but not limited to detergents, dishwashing materials, scrubbing compositions, window cleaners and the like. In these preparations, the compound of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other perfuming compositions, solvents, adjuvants and the like. The nature and variety of the other ingredients that can also be employed are known to those with skill in the art. Many types of fragrances can be employed in the present invention, the only limitation being the compatibility with the other components being employed. Suitable fragrances include but are not limited to fruits such as almond, apple, cherry, grape, pear, pineapple, orange, strawberry, raspberry; musk; and flower scents such as lavender-like, rose-like, iris-like, carnation-like. Other pleasant scents include herbal and woodland scents derived from pine, spruce and other forest smells. Fragrances may also be derived from various oils, such as essential oils, or from plant materials such as peppermint, spearmint and the like. A list of suitable fragrances is provided in US Pat. No. 4,534,891, the contents of which are incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety. Another source of suitable fragrances is found in Perfumes, Cosmetics and Soaps, Second Edition, edited by W. A. Poucher, 1959.
