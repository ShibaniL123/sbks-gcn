In recent years, the metal belt type continuous variable transmission has been spotlighted as a motor vehicle transmission from the view point of less energy loss caused by the transmission. An excellent friction characteristic and lubricating characteristic between the metal belt and the metal pulley are extremely stressed as the lubricating oil used for the metal belt type continuous variable transmission, and performance as a lubricating oil for gears taking out torque and bearings supporting the gears, and performance as a hydraulic pressure control medium for determining a transmission ratio, that is, performance as a hydraulic operating oil are also required. When the continuous variable transmission is provided with a forward and reverse travel changing wet clutch or a lock-up system of a torque converter, performance for controlling the friction characteristic of the wet clutch is also required in addition to the above performances. Thus, since various performances are required for the lubricating oil for the metal belt type continuous variable transmission, practically, the automatic transmission fluid (ATF) is generally used. However, although the performance as the hydraulic operating oil and a function for controlling the friction characteristic of the wet clutch are excellent when the ATF is used as the lubricating oil for the metal belt type continuous variable transmission, the intermetallic friction coefficient of the belt and the pulley is not sufficient. Therefore, the conventional metal belt type continuous variable transmission using the ATF has a limited transmission torque capacity, and can be disadvantageously mounted on only a mini motor vehicle. A higher torque transmission capacity is required with recent acceleration of requirement for improving fuel economy, by contrast, improvement in the transmission characteristic (shudder-preventing property) is also required from the aspect of ride comfort. That is, the simultaneous pursuit of conflicting requirements for maintaining a high torque transmission capacity and for improving the transmission characteristic is an unresolved issue. The present invention has been accomplished in light of these circumstances, and its object is to provide an additive for lubricating oil and a lubricating oil composition which can achieve a high intermetallic friction coefficient between a belt and a pulley in a metal belt type continuous variable transmission, and can achieve an excellent transmission characteristic. Solution to Problem In order to solve the above problems, the present invention provides an additive for lubricating oil containing an amide compound represented by the following general formula (1). [in-line-formulae]R1R2N—COCH2OH (1)[/in-line-formulae] (In the general formula (1), R1 and R2 may be the same or different and each represents an alkyl group having 16 to 22 carbon atoms.) The present invention provides a lubricating oil composition containing: a lubricating base oil containing a mineral base oil and/or a synthetic base oil; and the amide compound represented by the above general formula (1). In the lubricating oil composition of the present invention, a content of the amide compound represented by the general formula (1) is preferably 0.01 to 0.5% by mass in terms of a nitrogen atom based on the total amount of the lubricating oil composition, more preferably 0.01 to 0.25% by mass, and particularly preferably 0.02 to 0.1% by mass. Preferably, at least one of R1 and R2 in the general formula (1) is an alkyl group having 16 or 18 carbon atoms, and more preferably, both R1 and R2 are alkyl groups having 16 or 18 carbon atoms. Furthermore, a mixture of compounds in which R1 and R2 are alkyl groups having 16 or 18 carbon atoms can be used as the amide compound represented by the general formula (1). In this case, the ratio (molar ratio) of the alkyl group having 16 carbon atoms and the alkyl group having 18 carbon atoms in the mixture is preferably 1:99 to 49:51. It is preferable that the lubricating oil composition of the present invention contains a phosphorus additive at 0.005 to 0.1% by mass in terms of phosphorous element, a calcium-based metal cleaning agent at 0.005 to 0.1% by mass in terms of calcium element, and an ashless dispersant at 0.5 to 8.0% by mass based on the total amount of the lubricating oil composition, and contains no zinc dithiophosphate. The lubricating oil composition of the present invention can be used as a lubricating oil composition for an automatic transmission having a wet clutch, and is particularly suitable as a lubricating oil composition for a continuous variable transmission provided with a metal belt or a metal chain and a pulley. Advantageous Effects of Invention The present invention can provide an additive for lubricating oil and a lubricating oil composition which can achieve a high intermetallic friction coefficient between a belt and a pulley in a metal belt type continuous variable transmission, and can achieve an excellent transmission characteristic. The maintenance of a high torque transmission capacity (high metal μ) between the belt and the pulley and the prolongation of a shudder life can be achieved by using the additive for lubricating oil and the lubricating oil composition of the present invention which have an excellent characteristic; the pressing pressure of the pulley can be reduced; and fuel economy can be accordingly improved. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail. First Embodiment Additive for Lubricating Oil An additive for lubricating oil according to a first embodiment of the present invention contains an amide compound represented by the following general formula (1). [in-line-formulae]R1R2N—COCH2OH (1)[/in-line-formulae] (In the general formula (1), R1 and R2 may be the same or different and each represents an alkyl group having 16 to 22 carbon atoms.) R1 and R2 in the general formula (1) are alkyl groups having 16 to 22 carbon atoms, and preferably alkyl groups having 16 to 18 carbon atoms. Preferably, at least one of R1 or R2 is preferably an alkyl group having 16 or 18 carbon atoms, and more preferably, both R1 and R2 are alkyl groups having 16 or 18 carbon atoms. When the number of the carbon atoms of the alkyl group represented by R1 and R2 is less than 16, a shudder life is insufficient. This is considered to be due to the fact that an oiliness-improving effect is not sufficient. When the number of the carbon atoms of the alkyl group is greater than 22, an intermetallic friction coefficient cannot be sufficiently reduced. This is considered to be due to the fact that the adsorbability of the amide compound to the surface of a member is reduced. Furthermore, a mixture of two or more amide compounds in which the number of the carbon atoms of R1 is different from that of R2 can be used as the amide compound represented by the general formula (1). A mixture of compounds in which R1 and R2 are alkyl groups having 16 or 18 carbon atoms is suitable as the mixture. In this case, the ratio (molar ratio) of the alkyl group having 16 carbon atoms and the alkyl group having 18 carbon atoms in the mixture is preferably 1:99 to 49:51. The reduction of the intermetallic friction coefficient and the prolongation of the shudder life can be achieved in a higher level by setting the ratio to the above range. The amide compound represented by the general formula (1) can be obtained by the reaction of glycolic acid and dialkylamine represented by R1R2NH (the contents of the definition of R1 and R2 are the same as those of the case of the general formula (1)). This reaction can be represented by the following formula (2). The dialkylamine represented by R1R2NH which is a raw material can be synthesized according to reaction schemes represented by the following formulae (3) and (4). Carboxylic acid which is a raw material is deoxided to alcohol in the following formula (3), and the dialkylamine is synthesized by the dehydration condensation of the produced alcohol and ammonium in the following formula (4). The additive for lubricating oil according to the embodiment may contain only the amide compound represented by the general formula (1) or may be a mixture of the amide compound represented by the general formula (1) and other additive. The other additive used in combination will be described in detail in the description of a second embodiment. Second Embodiment Lubricating Oil Composition A lubricating oil composition according to a second embodiment of the present invention contains a lubricating base oil containing a mineral base oil and/or a synthetic base oil, and an amide compound represented by the above general formula (1). A mode containing the above lubricating base oil and the additive for lubricating oil according to the first embodiment is included in the lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment. The lubricating base oil in the embodiment is not particularly limited, and a lubricating base oil used for a usual lubricating oil can be used as the lubricating base oil. Specifically, a mineral lubricating base oil, a synthetic lubricating base oil, or a mixture in which two or more lubricating base oils selected therefrom are mixed at any rate, or the like can be used. Specific examples of the mineral lubricating base oil include a base oil refined by subjecting a lubricating oil distillate obtained by subjecting an atmospheric bottom oil obtained by atmospheric distillation of a crude oil to vacuum distillation to one or more processings such as solvent deasphalting, solvent extraction, hydrocracking, solvent dewaxing, and hydrorefining, or a base oil manufactured by a method for isomerizing a wax isomerizing mineral oil and GTL wax (Gas-to-liquid wax). Specific examples of the synthetic lubricating oil include polybutene or a hydrogenated product thereof; poly-α-olefin such as 1-octene oligomer or 1-decene oligomer, or a hydrogenated product thereof; a diester such as ditridecyl glutarate, di-2-ethylhexyl adipate, diisodecyl adipate, ditridecyl adipate, or di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate; a polyol ester such as trimethylolpropane caprylate, trimethylolpropane pelargonate, pentaerythritol-2-ethylhexanoate, or pentaerythritol pelargonate; and an aromatic synthetic oil such as alkylnaphthalene or alkylbenzene, or a mixture thereof. The kinematic viscosity of the lubricating base oil is not particularly limited, and the kinematic viscosity of the lubricating base oil at 100° C. is preferably equal to or less than 50 mm2/s, more preferably equal to or less than 40 mm2/s, still more preferably equal to or less than 20 mm2/s, and particularly preferably equal to or less than 10 mm2/s. When the kinematic viscosity of the lubricating base oil at 100° C. is greater than 50 mm2/s, a low-temperature viscosity characteristic tends to be insufficient. The kinematic viscosity of the lubricating base oil at 100° C. is preferably equal to or greater than 1 mm2/s, and more preferably equal to or greater than 2 mm2/s. When the kinematic viscosity of the lubricating base oil at 100° C. is less than 1 mm2/s, oil film formation at lubricated sites tends to be insufficient, resulting in inferior lubricity and a large evaporation loss amount of the lubricating base oil. The viscosity index of the lubricating base oil is not particularly limited, and is preferably equal to or greater than 80 from the view point of the low-temperature viscosity characteristic. From the view point of obtaining an excellent viscosity characteristic in a wide temperature range from a low temperature to a high temperature, the viscosity index of the lubricating base oil is more preferably equal to or greater than 100, still more preferably equal to or greater than 110, and particularly preferably equal to or greater than 120. The sulfur content of the lubricating base oil is not particularly limited, and is preferably equal to or less than 0.1% by mass, more preferably equal to or less than 0.01% by mass, still more preferably equal to or less than 0.005% by mass, and particularly preferably substantially free (equal to or less than 0.001% by mass). The term “sulfur content” referred in the present invention means a value measured in accordance with JIS K 2541-4 “Energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence method” (usually, a range of 0.01 to 5% by mass) or JIS K 2541-5 “Bomb Mass Determination Method, Appendix (Regulations), Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrophotometry” (usually, equal to or greater than 0.05% by mass). The total aromatic content of the lubricating base oil is not particularly limited, and is preferably equal to or less than 30% by mass, more preferably equal to or less than 15% by mass, still more preferably equal to or less than 5% by mass, and particularly preferably 2% by mass. When the total aromatic content of the lubricating base oil is greater than 30% by mass, oxidation stability tends to be insufficient. The term “total aromatic content” referred in the present invention means an aromatic fraction content determined in accordance with ASTM D2549. Usually, the aromatic fraction includes alkylbenzene; alkylnaphthalene; anthracene, phenanthrene, and an alkylated product thereof; a compound in which four or more benzene rings are condensated to each other; or compounds having heteroaromatics such as pyridines, quinolines, phenols, or naphthols. The NOACK evaporation amount of the lubricating base oil is not particularly limited, and is preferably 2 to 70% by mass, more preferably 5 to 60% by mass, still more preferably 20 to 50% by mass, and particularly preferably 25 to 50% by mass. The term “NOACK evaporation amount” referred in the present invention means an evaporation loss amount measured in accordance with ASTM D 5800-95. The specific aspect and a preferred aspect of the amide compound represented by the general formula (1) in the embodiment are the same as those in the case of the first embodiment, and duplicate description thereof will be omitted here. The content of the amide compound represented by the general formula (1) in the embodiment is preferably 0.01 to 0.5% by mass in terms of a nitrogen atom based on the total amount of the lubricating oil composition, more preferably 0.01 to 0.25% by mass, and particularly preferably 0.02 to 0.1% by mass. The reduction of the intermetallic friction coefficient and the prolongation of the shudder life can be achieved in a higher level by setting the content to the above range. When the content is less than 0.01% by mass, the improvement effect of the shudder life is lack. On the other hand, when the content is greater than 0.5% by mass, the intermetallic friction coefficient may be reduced. The lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment can further contain the following additives in addition to the above constituent components. The lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment can further contain a wear-resistant agent (also referred to as an extreme-pressure agent). As the wear-resistant agent, any wear-resistant agent used for the lubricating oil can be used. For example, a sulfur extreme-pressure agent, a phosphorus extreme-pressure agent, and a sulfur-phosphorus extreme-pressure agent can be used; and specific examples thereof include phosphorous acid esters, thiophosphorous acid esters, dithiophosphorous acid esters, trithiophosphorous acid esters, phosphoric acid esters, thiophosphoric acid esters, dithiophosphoric acid esters, trithiophosphoric acid esters, amine salts thereof, metal salts thereof, derivatives thereof, dithiocarbamate, zinc dithiocarbamate, molybdenum dithiocarbamate, disulfides, polysulfides, olefin sulfides, and sulfurized fats and oils. Preferably, the lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment further contains a phosphorus additive as the wear-resistant agent. A phosphorus compound represented by the following general formula (5) or a derivative thereof can be preferably used as the phosphorus additive. In the general formula (5), R3 and R4 represent a straight-chain type alkyl group having 11 to 20 carbon atoms. R3 and R4 are preferably straight-chain type alkyl groups having 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Examples of the straight-chain type alkyl group having 11 to 20 carbon atoms include an n-undecyl group, an n-dodecyl group, an n-tridecyl group, an n-tetradecyl group, an n-pentadecyl group, an n-hexadecyl group, an n-heptadecyl group, an n-octadecyl group, an n-nonadecyl group, and an n-icosyl group. In the general formula (5), R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a straight-chain type alkyl group having 11 to 20 carbon atoms. Specific examples of the straight-chain type alkyl group having 11 to 20 carbon atoms are the same as those in the case of R3 and R4. When R3, R4, or R5 is other than the above groups, an intermetallic friction characteristic between a belt and a pulley may be reduced. Therefore, the case is not preferable. In the general formula (5), X1, X2, and X3 each represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, and preferably an oxygen atom. Specific examples of the derivative of the phosphorus compound represented by the general formula (5) include a salt in which a phosphorus compound such as hydrogenated phosphorous acid ester (hydrogen phosphite) or hydrogenated thiophosphorous acid ester (hydrogen thiophosphite) in which R5 in the formula (5) is a hydrogen atom is subjected to a nitrogen-containing compound such as ammonia or an amine compound containing only a hydrocarbon group or hydroxyl group-containing hydrocarbon group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms in a molecule, to neutralize a part or all of remaining acidic hydrogen. Specific examples thereof include ammonia; an alkylamine such as monomethylamine, monoethylamine, monopropylamine, monobutylamine, monopentylamine, monohexylamine, monoheptylamine, monooctylamine, dimethylamine, methylethylamine, diethylamine, methylpropylamine, ethylpropylamine, dipropylamine, methylbutylamine, ethylbutylamine, propylbutylamine, dibutylamine, dipentylamine, dihexylamine, diheptylamine, or dioctylamine (an alkyl group may be straight-chain or branched); an alkanolamine such as monomethanolamine, monoethanolamine, monopropanolamine, monobutanolamine, monopentanolamine, monohexanolamine, monoheptanolamine, monooctanolamine, monononanolamine, dimethanolamine, methanolethanolamine, diethanolamine, methanolpropanolamine, ethanolpropanolamine, dipropanolamine, methanolbutanolamine, ethanolbutanolamine, propanolbutanolamine, dibutanolamine, dipentanolamine, dihexanolamine, diheptanolamine, or dioctanolamine (an alkanol group may be straight-chain or branched); and a mixture thereof. From the view point that the intermetallic friction characteristic between the belt and the pulley is more excellent, a phosphorous acid ester (hydrogen phosphite) and a thiophosphorous acid ester in which R5 in the general formula (5) is hydrogen, or the amine salts and alkanolamine salts of the phosphorus compounds, or the like are more preferably used as the phosphorus additive. More specifically, dialkyl hydrogen phosphite such as di-n-undecyl hydrogen phosphite, di-n-dodecyl hydrogen phosphite, di-n-tridecyl hydrogen phosphite, di-n-tetradecyl hydrogen phosphite, di-n-pentadecyl hydrogen phosphite, di-n-hexadecyl hydrogen phosphite, di-n-heptadecyl hydrogen phosphite, di-n-octadecyl hydrogen phosphite, di-n-nonadecyl hydrogen phosphite, or di-n-icosyl hydrogen phosphite; trialkyl hydrogen phosphite such as tri-n-undecyl hydrogen phosphite, tri-n-dodecyl hydrogen phosphite, tri-n-tridecyl hydrogen phosphite, tri-n-tetradecyl hydrogen phosphite, tri-n-pentadecyl hydrogen phosphite, tri-n-hexadecyl hydrogen phosphite, tri-n-heptadecyl hydrogen phosphite, tri-n-octadecyl hydrogen phosphite, tri-n-nonadecyl hydrogen phosphite, or tri-n-icosyl hydrogen phosphate; or mixtures of the amine salts thereof, alkanolamine salts thereof, or the phosphorus compounds are preferable. In the lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment, the content of the phosphorus additive is preferably equal to or greater than 0.005% by mass in terms of phosphorous element based on the total amount of the lubricating oil composition, more preferably equal to or greater than 0.01% by mass, and still more preferably equal to or greater than 0.015% by mass. The content is preferably equal to or less than 0.1% by mass, more preferably equal to or less than 0.08% by mass, and still more preferably equal to or less than 0.07% by mass. When the content of the phosphorus additive is less than 0.005% by mass, the improvement effect of the intermetallic friction coefficient between the belt and the pulley is lack. On the other hand, when the content is greater than 0.1% by mass, the oxidation stability of the lubricating oil composition may be reduced or the durability of a seal material and a resin material or the like may be adversely affected. Therefore, both the cases are not preferable. The lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment can further contain a metal cleaning agent. A calcium-based metal cleaning agent is suitable as the metal cleaning agent, and specific examples thereof include a normal salt, a basic salt, or a perbasic salt of sulfonate, phenate, or salicylate or the like. Any one of the metal cleaning agents can be used alone, or two or more thereof can be used in combination. When the calcium-based metal cleaning agent is used in the lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment, the content thereof is preferably equal to or greater than 0.005% by mass in terms of calcium element based on the total amount of the lubricating oil composition, more preferably equal to or greater than 0.01% by mass, and still more preferably equal to or greater than 0.015% by mass. The content is preferably equal to or less than 0.1% by mass, more preferably equal to or less than 0.08% by mass, and still more preferably equal to or less than 0.07% by mass. When the content of the calcium-based metal cleaning agent is less than 0.005% by mass, the improvement effect of the intermetallic friction coefficient is lack. On the other hand, when the content is greater than 0.1% by mass, the shudder life may be shortened. Therefore, both the cases are not preferable. The lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment can further contain an ashless dispersant. Any ashless dispersant such as alkenyl succinimide, benzylamine, or alkenyl polyamine which is used for the lubricating oil can be used as the ashless dispersant. Examples thereof include mono-succinicimide in which a straight-chain type or branching type alkyl or alkenyl succinic anhydride having 40 to 400 carbon atoms is added to one end of polyamine in imidizing and which is represented by the following general formula (6), or bis-succinimide in which the straight-chain type or branching type alkyl or alkenyl succinic anhydride is added to both ends of polyamine and which is represented by the following general formula (7). In the general formulae (6) and (7), R6, R7, and R8 each independently represent a straight-chain type or branching type alkyl group or alkenyl group having 40 to 400 carbon atoms, and preferably 60 to 350 carbon atoms. a is an integer of 1 to 10, and preferably 2 to 5; and b is an integer of 0 to 10, and preferably 1 to 5. Alternatively, boron-modified succinimide in which a boron compound such as boric acid (orthoboric acid, metaboric acid, or tetraboric acid or the like), a borate salt, or a boric acid ester is subjected to the succinicimide, or the like can be also used. A method for manufacturing the above succinicimide is not specifically limited, and the succinicimide is obtained by, for example, reacting alkylsuccinic acid or alkenyl succinic acid obtained by reacting a compound having an alkyl group or an alkenyl group having 40 to 400 carbon atoms with maleic anhydride at 100 to 200° C., with polyamine. Examples of the polyamine include diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, and pentaethylene hexamine. In the lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment, the content of the ashless dispersant is preferably equal to or greater than 0.5% by mass based on the total amount of the lubricating oil composition, more preferably equal to or greater than 1.0% by mass, and still more preferably equal to or greater than 2.0% by mass. The content is preferably equal to or less than 8.0% by mass based on the total amount of the lubricating oil composition, more preferably equal to or less than 7.0% by mass, and still more preferably equal to or less than 6.0% by mass. When the content of the ashless dispersant is less than the lower limit based on the total amount of the lubricating oil composition, the improvement effect of the intermetallic friction coefficient is lack. On the other hand, when the content is greater than the upper limit, an initial shudder-preventing property and the shudder life may be reduced. Therefore, both the cases are not preferable. In order to further improve the performance, the lubricating oil composition according to the embodiment can contain any additive generally used for the lubricating oil according to the purpose. Examples of the additive include additives such as an antioxidant, a wear-resistant agent (or an extreme-pressure agent), a corrosion inhibitor, a rust inhibitor, a viscosity index improver, a pour point depressant, an antiemulsifier, a metal deactivator, an antifoaming agent, and an ash-free friction modifier.
