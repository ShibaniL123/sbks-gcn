CATHETER STRUCTURES FOR REDUCING FLUOROSCOPY USAGE DURING ENDOVASCULAR PROCEDURES This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 61/972,580, filed March 31, 2014, and 62/083,745, filed November 24, 2014, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. Technical Field This disclosure relates generally to interventional medical procedures, such as angioplasty, and, more particularly, to a catheter structure with markings to reduce the usage of fluoroscopy during the procedure. Background A clinician performing an endovascular procedure, such as angioplasty, will typically use fluoroscopy in the course of performing a diagnostic angiogram to assess the location of a treatment area (such as where a lesion or blockage is present in the vasculature). Upon gaining guidewire access to the vasculature using additional fluoroscopy, and then inserting the catheter along the guidewire, the clinician will then typically use even more fluoroscopy, either continuously or intermittently (e.g., "spot checking), in order to confirm the catheter has reached the location of the treatment area. As can be appreciated, this conventional approach increases the exposure of the patient and others, including the clinician and assistants, to fluoroscopy and, hence, radiation, which is generally desired to be avoided to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, a need exists for a manner in which to position a catheter structure into the vasculature at a treatment area while reducing the amount or frequency of fluoroscopy used. 1 Summary One object of the disclosure is to provide a catheter structure, such as a balloon catheter, guidewire, or the like, with markings perceptible outside of the vasculature for use in determining at a location external to the body the position of the catheter structure relative to a treatment area. One embodiment relates to an apparatus for use by a clinician in treating the vasculature. The apparatus may include a catheter structure having a shaft including a first distal portion adapted for positioning at the treatment area and a proximal portion including a marking perceptible by the clinician external to the vasculature without the use of fluoroscopy, the marking being representative of a length from a pre-determined starting point on the catheter structure. Consequently, the markings may be used to position the catheter structure a distance in the vasculature corresponding to the length with minimal use of fluoroscopy. The marking may comprise a plurality of regularly spaced marks or irregularly spaced marks. In one aspect, the marking may be printed on the catheter structure. The markings may comprise a plurality of first marks and at least one second mark different from the plurality of first marks. For example, the first marks may comprise spaced bands and the second mark may comprise an alphanumerical indicia. The marking may be provided adjacent a hub associated with the catheter structure. In a further aspect, the marking may be luminescent, such as chemiluminescent or photoluminescent. In a further aspect, the catheter structure may comprise a balloon adjacent to a tip including the pre-determined starting point. One or more radiopaque markings may be adjacent to the balloon. The catheter structure may include a treatment element selected from the group consisting of a drug, a stent, a graft, a cutter, a focused force wire, or any combination thereof. Additionally, the catheter structure may comprise a guidewire, and may be adapted for slidably receiving the guidewire. In another embodiment, an apparatus for treating a treatment area at an intravascular location in a body is disclosed. The apparatus may include a catlieter including a shaft having a distal portion including a balloon and a proximal portion including at least one marking arranged for being viewed at a reference point external to the body for identifying a distance from the treatment area to the reference point. The balloon may further include a treatment element selected from the group consisting of a stent, a graft, a cutter, a focused force wire, or any combination thereof. Another embodiment relates to a method of treating a treatment area in a body. The method may comprise inserting a distal portion of a guidewire to the treatment area, determining a position of a first marking on a proximal portion of the guidewire relative to a reference point, and inserting a catheter a distance corresponding to the first marking. A further embodiment relates to an apparatus for use by a clinician in treating the vasculature. The apparatus may include a catheter structure having a shaft including a first distal portion adapted for positioning at the treatment area and a proximal portion, and means external to the vasculature for determining a length from a pre -determined starting point on the catheter structure, whereby the determining means may be used to position the catheter structure a distance in the vasculature corresponding to the length with minimal use of fluoroscopy.

The method may comprise comprising providing a marking perceptible to a clinician on a first portion of the catheter structure external to the vasculature to provide a representation of an amount a second portion of the catheter structure has been inserted into the vasculature. The providing step may comprise printing the marking on the catheter structure. The providing step may further comprise providing a plurality of first marks and at least one second mark different from the plurality of first marks. The first marks may comprise spaced bands and the second mark may comprise an alphanumerical indicia.

Detailed Description The description provided below and in regard to the figures applies to all embodiments unless noted otherwise, and features common to each embodiment are similarly shown and numbered. Provided is a catheter structure in the form of a tubular catheter 10 capable of being actuated in some manner in order to provide a treatment. In this one example for purposes of illustration, the catheter 10 includes a distal portion 1 1 with an actuatable element in the form of a balloon 12 mounted on a catheter tube 14. Referring to Figures 1, 2, and 3, the balloon 12 has an intermediate section 16, or "barrel" having the working surface W, and end sections 18, 20. In one embodiment, the end sections 18, 20 reduce in diameter to join the intermediate section 16 to the catheter tube 14 (and thus sections 18, 20 are generally termed cones or cone sections). The balloon 12 is sealed to catheter tube 1 at balloon ends (proximal 15a and distal 15b) on the end sections 18, 20 to allow the inflation of the balloon 12 via one or more inflation lumens 17 extending within catheter tube 14 and communicating with the interior of the balloon 12. The catheter tube 14 also includes an elongated, tubular shaft 24 forming a lumen 23 that directs another catheter structure, such as guidewire 26, through the catheter 10. As illustrated in Figure 3, this guidewire 26 may be inserted through a first port 25 of a connector 27, such as a hub, into the lumen 23 to achieve an "over the wire" (OTW) arrangement, but could also be provided in a "rapid exchange" configuration in which the guidewire 26 enters the lumen through a lateral opening 14a closer to the distal end (see Figure 4). A second port 29 may also be associated with catheter 10, such as by way of connector 27, for introducing a fluid (e.g., saline, a contrast agent, or both) into the interior of the balloon 12 via the inflation lumen 17. Balloon 12 may include a single or multi-layered balloon wall 28. The balloon 12 may be a non-compliant balloon having a balloon wall 28 that maintains its size and shape in one or more directions when the balloon is inflated. The balloon 12 in such case also has a predetermined surface area that remains constant during and after inflation, also has a predetermined length and pre-determined circumference that each, or together, remain constant during and after inflation. However, the balloon 12 could be semi-compliant or compliant instead, depending on the particular use. The catheter 10 may also be adapted for use in connection with resolving chronic total occlusions or artherectomy, and thus may be provided with a cutter or cutting element. The catheter 10 may also be used in connection with a drug, a cutting element, a stent, a graft, or like treatment. In order to provide an enhanced locatability during an interventional procedure while minimizing the use of fluoroscopy, the catheter 10 may be provided with a marking 30 perceptible along a portion external to the vasculature during the procedure, such as on or along tube 14. As shown in Figure 5, the marking 30 may comprise a plurality of spaced marks 32, such as circular or partially circular (e.g., 1 -359 degrees) bands surrounding the shaft 14 and positioned at pre-determined intervals. These marks 32 may extend from adjacent the connector 27 to the proximal end 15a of the balloon 12, or any portion thereof (which is considered the "proximal portion" of the catheter 10, as contrasted with the distal portion including the balloon 12). The marks 32 may be evenly or unevenly spaced (e.g., the marks may get progressively closer along the length of the shaft 24). The marks 32 may be of a single color, such as for example black as shown in Figure 5, but as shown in Figure 6 may also be provided in different shades or colors. The marks 32 may also comprise hash lines with gradations identified by numbers, letters, or symbols and, thus, may effectively form a ruler. In any case, the marks 32 may be non-radiopaque or otherwise may not be adapted to fluoresce. The marking 30 may also comprise a biocompatible chemiluminescent or photoluminescent material that may be easily viewed in the low light conditions often present during a procedure involving fluoroscopy. Alternatively or additionally, the marking 30 may be provided in a manner that allows for tactile perception, such as in the forms of notches, bumps, ridges, recesses, or like structures that can be counted even when not directly visible. In any case, the marking 30 may be incorporated directly into the material of the tube 14 or placed thereon (including possibly by using printing techniques). A further embodiment is shown in Figure 7. In this embodiment, it can be understood that the marking 30 is provided on the catheter 10 in the form of spaced marks 32, each of which represents a known distance from a pre-determined, fixed location on the catheter 10. In this one illustrated example, the fixed location is the distal tip P, which thus may be considered the starting point S in terms of the measured distance (but the starting point S could be located VI elsewhere on a structure connected to the catheter 10, such as at the balloon distal end 35b, along the body of the balloon 12, or at the balloon proximal end 15a, as non-limiting examples). Each mark 32 may then represent a fixed distance in from the starting point S, such as mark 32 at point D indicating a distance of 20 centimeters (which is simply an exemplary value). Point D+l represents a further distance, such as 21 centimeters, in a known increment (which could be centimeters, but could also be millimeters, meters, inches, feet, etc. or portions thereof - the particular units are not considered to be important). The marks 32 may be provided up to a predetermined end point E, such as D+75 from the starting point S, which in this case represents 95 centimeters (but again, may be any value depending on the desired scale, catheter length, procedure, etc.). Optionally, the catheter 10 may also be provided with one or more secondary markings 34 in the form of printed indicia representative of distance, such as in the form of alphanumeric characters. For example, between marking D+10 and marking D+l l in the illustrated embodiment, the number "30" may be printed on the shaft as an indication of the distance from the zero point Z, which here is thirty centimeters (but again is simply an example). This allows the clinician to assess the value for adjacent marks 32 quickly, even when provided in a form that does not admit to being perceptable as a particular distance (e.g., a band). The use of characters (e.g., X = 10 cm, L - 50, C=100) is also possible to determine the distance, as is the use of a key in connection therewith (e.g., A-10 cm, B~50 cm, C=100 cm). In use, and with reference to Figure 8, a catheter 100 including the marking 30 may be inserted in to a vessel V to a particular treatment area A, which is shown as comprising a lesion L but may take other forms (e.g, a chronic total occlusion, or a location at which the application of a stent, graft, or the like, is desired). This may be done following an assessment of the location of the treatment area, such as by performing a diagnostic angiogram. Inserting the catheter 100 may involve viewing the passing marks 32 during insertion through the introducer I, and either counting them or stopping the insertion process when a known distance is reached. At the point where the marking 30 (such as mark 32') corresponds to the intended distance of insertion, the clinician is assured that the treatment area A has been reached by the distal portion of the catheter 10 (especially when the tip P reflects the starting point S, in which case the known length of the lesion L and the known length of the balloon 12 or other treatment may be used to achieve proper positioning using simple math). Radiopaque markers, such as bands 102, may optionally be provided to aid in confirming the location using fluoroscopy, the use of which has otherwise been minimized as the result of using the marking 30 to position the catheter 100. An alternative aspect of the disclosure is to provide a catheter structure in the form of a guidewire 200 with a marking 230, which may be along a portion external to the body during the procedure. As shown in Figure 9, the marking 230 may comprise a plurality of spaced marks 232, such as bands. These marks 232 may extend from adjacent a distal end 200a of the guidewire 200 to a proximal end 200b, or any portion thereof. The marks 232 may be evenly or unevenly spaced (e.g., the marks may get progressively closer along the length of the guidewire 200). The marks 232 may be of a single color, such as for example black, or may be provided in different shades or colors. The marks 232 may also comprise hash lines with gradations identified by numbers, letters, or symbols, and thus may effectively form a ruler. The marks 232 may be non-radiopaque or may otherwise not be visible under fluoroscopy. The marking 230 may also comprise a biocompatible chemiluminescent or photoluminescent material that may be easily viewed in the low light conditions often present during a procedure involving fluoroscopy. Alternatively or additionally, the marking 230 may be provided in a manner that allows for tactile engagement, such as in the forms of notches, bumps, ridges, recesses, or like structures that can be counted even when not directly visible. In any case, the marking 230 may be incorporated into the material of the guidewire 200 or placed thereon (including possibly by using printing techniques). Each mark 232 may then represent a fixed distance in from the starting point S, such as mark 232 at point B indicating a distance of 20 centimeters (which is simply an exemplary value). Point EH I represents a further distance, such as 21 centimeters, in a known increment (which could be centimeters, but could also be millimeters, meters, inches, feet, etc. or any divisions thereof - the particular units are not considered to be important). The marks 232 may be provided up to a pre -determined point D+75 from the starting point S, which in this case represents a distance of 95 centimeters (but again, may be any value depending on the desired scale, catheter length, procedure, etc.). In use, with reference to Figure 10, a guidewire 200 including the marking 230 may be inserted in to a vessel V to a particular location, such as adjacent to a treatment area A. This may include a lesion L, as shown, but as noted above may take other forms (e.g. a chronic total occlusion). Prior to the insertion, an assessment of the location of the treatment area, such as by performing a diagnostic angiogram, may be completed. Inserting the guidewire 200 may involve viewing the passing marks 232 during insertion through the introducer I, and either counting them or stopping the insertion process when a known distance is reached (note references S as starting point, D as a first mark, and E as the end point mark). At the point where the marking 230 (such as mark 232') corresponds to the intended distance of insertion, the clinician is assured that the treatment area A has been reached. In the case where the guidewire 200 includes at least partially radiopaque markers, the location may be confirmed using fluoroscopy, the use of which has otherwise been minimized as the result of using the marking 230 to position the guidewire 200 in the vasculature. With knowledge of the distance to the treatment area A thus provided by the marking 230 on the guidewire 200, the clinician may choose an appropriate treatment device, such as a catheter (including those examples mentioned here; see catheter 100 in Figure 1 1 ) having a suitable length. The marking 230 may also then be used in positioning the catheter 100 at the treatment area A by using the marks 232 to determine the insertion distance, such as with respect to a reference point F on the guidewire 200 and thereby potentially further reduce the amount of fluoroscopy required. The technology disclosed herein may be applied to various types of catheters, without limitation. For example, it may be applied to guide catheters, diagnostic catheters, IVUS catheters, OCT catheters, as well as all crossing or thrombectomy catheters (including those using mechanical (e.g., rigid tips, cutters, etc.), laser, fluid, or vibration energy to penetrate through blockages or occlusions). In one particular example, and with reference to Figure 12, such a crossing catheter 300 may be used to gain access to a desired treatment area A, such as by penetrating through an occlusion O. Using the marking 330 comprised of marks 332 (which may be the same form as marks 32 or 232) in connection with such a crossing catheter 300, the clinician may note a first mark (such as mark M) on the catheter 300 (such as external to the vasculature) corresponding to the distance of insertion of the catheter at the proximal end or margin X of the treatment area A (which may be relative to an external structure, such as a point on a sheath, introducer I, or the like). Once the crossing catheter 300 is advanced to the end of the treatment area A, such as at the distal end or margin Y of the occlusion O (see Figure 13), a second mark 332 (such as mark N) on the crossing catheter 300 may be noted. The first and second marks M, N together thus define the length of the treatment area A, and can be measured external to the vasculature in for developing the treatment plan or otherwise. Subsequently, a second catheter 400 with a marking 430 comprising corresponding or matching marks 432 (such as, for example, a cathether including artherectomy technology (e.g., any of orbital, rotational, laser, and directional devices), thrombectomy technology, PTA technology, stent technology, or any other technology) may be inserted the precise distance necessary to place the corresponding portion of the catheter 400 for providing the particular treatment at a location corresponding to the treatment area A. This may be achieved by noting the relative location of the corresponding marks (such as M, N, which as noted above may be color coded, specially arranged or shaped, identified by an alphanumeric indicator (such as to form a ruler)) or otherwise indicated to correspond to the marks 332 on the crossing catheter 300). In the illustrated embodiment, the technology is a PTA technology including treatment T in the form of an inflatable balloon and an associated guidewire 200 passing through the opening in the occlusion O formed using the crossing catheter 300, but as noted could take other forms. As should be appreciated, this process can be done repeatedly using different types of catheters for different uses, but having matching marking technology, all without the prolonged use of fluoroscopy in order to determine whether the treatment area A has been reached and the associated time involvement. The overall length of the procedure may this be reduced, which is especially beneficial since patients requiring the most serious interventions (e.g., CTOs) are usually the least able to tolerate lengthy procedures. As can be further appreciated, the crossing catheter 300 and second catheter 400 may be provided as a kit. This arrangement would aid the clinician in assuring that the marks are precisely matched, which may of course be done during the manufacturing process.
