The present invention relates to compositions and methods for enhancing the topical application of a benefit agent. The compositions are powder-to-liquid particles comprising a liquid core that is substantially free of water and comprises a polar liquid that has a percent surface polarity of at least 24%, at least one basic benefit or active agent and at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent surrounded by a shell comprising hydrophobic particles. The particles are stable in dry form and yet quickly transform into a liquid or cream-like form when subjected to shear. They can be advantageously formulated with other ingredients, particularly those unstable in the presence of water, into personal care compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that in the presence of a hydrophobic powder, such as a hydrophobic silicon dioxide powder (silicone-coated silica powder), water can be dispersed into fine droplets and enveloped by the hydrophobic material, thus preventing the droplets from rejoining. Such material has been described as “dry water,” “powdered water,” or “powder-to-liquid” and can have a water content of over 95%. It is formed by the intensive mixing of water with hydrophobic material. During this process water droplets are sheathed by the solid particles and prevented from flowing together again. The first experiments on the use of “dry water” as a cosmetic base date from the 1960's. See U.S. Pat. No. 3,393,155. These free-flowing, fine powders liquefy when rubbed on the skin. More recently, U.S. Pat. No. 6,290,941 describes cosmetic or pharmaceutical powder-to-liquid compositions comprising hydrophobically coated silica particles into which are incorporated water and a water soluble polymer, the composition containing substantially no oil. Such compositions are said to require less silica while retaining the water-holding capacity and permitting substantial elimination of added oil from the formula. WO 2011/075418 discloses a powdery composition comprising a) at least one powder in the form of core-shell particles, the core comprising liquid water or a liquid aqueous phase and the shell comprising hydrophobic or hydrophobized particles, and b) at least one powder comprising carrier, and b1) at least partially water soluble liquid and/or b2) a water reactive substrate each located in and/or on the carrier. Eshtiaghi et al., Powder Technology, Vol. 223, 2012, pages 65-76 describes a variety of powder-to-liquid materials and proposes mechanisms for their formation. Shell materials used included hydrophobic (silicone-coated) silica, hydrophobic glass beads and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE or TEFLON) powder. Core materials included water, glycerol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Reported particle sizes for materials containing glycerin were 1200 and 3400 microns. US 2012/0315312 teaches core-shell particles, the shell of which includes aggregated, hydrophobicized silicon dioxide particles and the core of which includes a liquid phase. The ratio of the silicon dioxide particles to the liquid phase is 2:98 to 40:60 based on the total weight of the particles and 60-100% by weight of glycerol is present in the liquid phase. U.S. application Ser. No. 13/719,649, filed Dec. 19, 2012 teaches a powder comprising core/shell particles having an average particle size of less than 1000 microns, each particle comprising: 1) a liquid core that is substantially free of water and comprises a polar liquid having a percent surface polarity of at least 24%, and 2) a shell comprising hydrophobic particles. The particles can include an active. U.S. Pat. No. 6,946,120 teaches a pharmaceutical composition for topical administration, including, as the pharmaceutically active component, at least 5% by weight of minoxidil; an acid in an amount to completely solubilize the minoxidil; a solvent composition including at least two of water, a lower alcohol and a co-solvent selected from one or more of the group consisting of aromatic and polyhydric alcohols; wherein when the co-solvent includes propylene glycol, it is present in an amount of less than approximately 10% by weight. Although water-based powder-to-liquids are commonly described, they are not suitable for formulating with active agents that are unstable or incompatible with water, e.g., plant extracts prone to oxidation and/or hydrolysis. In addition, water-containing particles generally lack structural stability and are prone to collapse or leak during storage, and allow evaporation of water from the core. There is also a need for compositions that improve skin penetration of benefit agents. U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,913 teaches micellar compositions that enhance skin penetration. Although effective, these compositions can be difficult to manufacture and the cost of the products are relatively high. Applicants have now discovered novel compositions and a method of enhancing the topical application of benefit agents. The compositions include powder-to-cream particles containing a core without water and at least one acidic solubility enhancer. Such particles are stable and useful for formulating with a variety of active agents, even those that are prone to oxidation and/or hydrolysis. Compositions containing such particles are also convenient to use while providing a cream-like, pleasant skin feel and skin substantivity (the ability to remain on the skin). The compositions can be used in cosmetic, skin care, wound care, dermatologic, and other personal care products, as well as in other applications and industries. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a powder including core/shell particles having an average particle size of less than 1000 microns, each particle contains a liquid core that is substantially free of water and includes A) a polar liquid having a percent surface polarity of at least 24%, B) a basic active ingredient, and C) from about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent that is not an active ingredient; and a shell comprising hydrophobic particles. The invention also provides a method for topically administering the active ingredient by rubbing the powder on the skin of a human or animal. The powder turns into a liquid or gel like or cream like composition from which the active or benefit agent is absorbed into the skin.

As used herein, “safe and effective amount” means an amount sufficient to provide a desired benefit at a desired level, but low enough to avoid serious side effects. The safe and effective amount of the ingredient or composition will vary with the area being treated, the age of the end user, the duration and nature of the treatment, the specific ingredient or composition employed, the particular carrier utilized, and like factors. As used herein, the term “treating” or “treatment” means the alleviation or elimination of symptoms, cure, prevention, or inhibition of a disease or medical condition, or improvement of tissue growth/healing or cosmetic conditions such as reducing appearance of skin wrinkles/fine lines, under-eye bags, cellulites, skin marks/hyperpigmentation or uneven tone.

It is understood that whether the term “about” is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including approximations due to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value. To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions herein are recited as a range from about amount X to about amount Y. It is understood that wherein a range is recited, the range is not limited to the recited upper and lower bounds, but rather includes the full range from about amount X through about amount Y, or any amount or range therein. Core/Shell Particles The powder of the invention comprises core/shell particles. Each particle comprises a liquid core that is substantially free of water and comprises a polar liquid, at least one basic active or benefit agent and from about 0.1% by weight to about 20% by weight of at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent. The polar liquid has a minimum surface polarity. The liquid core is surrounded by a shell of hydrophobic particles. Particles according to the present invention have a liquid core surrounded by a shell of hydrophobic particles. The core includes an emulsion or suspension comprising a polar liquid as the continuous (external) phase. The dispersed (internal) phase comprises a hydrophobic material and/or solid particles. The hydrophobic particles of the shell are in the form of loose powder held together only by weak liquid-powder and powder-powder interactions via weak van der Waals forces. When subjected to slight forces such as by rubbing with the hands, the core/shell particles collapse and the powder becomes a liquid, cream or gel. Overall, the average particle size of the core/shell particles is less than about 1000 micrometers, usually from about 1 micrometer to about 1000 micrometers, or about 2 micrometers to about 200 micrometers, or about 3 micrometers to about 100 micrometers, or about 5 micrometers to about 50 micrometers. The average particle size of the core/shell particles can be determined by any particle size measurement method for dry particles known to the art, such as optical microscopy, electron microscopy, or sieve analysis. The Core The liquid core comprises a polar liquid that is not water and from about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent, and at least one basic active or benefit agent, and has a minimum polar component of overall surface tension. As known in the art, the surface tension of a liquid (i.e., overall surface tension) is divided into two components, one representing a polar component and one representing a nonpolar (or dispersive) component. The polar component, “percent (%) surface polarity,” is determined using the method of Fowkes described in Fowkes, Journal of Achievements in Materials and Manufacturing Engineering, 24, 1 (2007) 137-145. Specifically, the overall surface tension of a sample is measured five times via the Wilhelmy plate method (described by Derelinch et. al. “Measurement of Interfacial Tension in Fluid-Fluid Systems”, in Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science, pages 3152-3166, Ed. By Arthur T. Hubbard, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 2002), using a Kruss Tensiometer K100. The plate used is a standard platinum plate of 19.9 mm×0.2 mm perimeter. The contact angle of each sample is also measured five times on a clean piece of poly(tertafluoroethylene) PTFE using a Kruss Drop Shape Analysis System DSA10. Measuring contact angle on PTFE is done as a means of separating the overall surface tension of each sample into polar and dispersive components. According to the Fowkes surface energy theory, the dispersive component of a liquid can be determined by knowing its overall surface tension and its contact angle against PTFE (which is a completely non-polar surface). The equation is as follows: σ L D = σ L 2  ( cos   θ PTFE + 1 ) 2 72 where θPTFE=the contact angle measured between PTFE and the sample liquid. The dispersive surface tension component (σLD) can be determined for any liquid for which the overall surface tension (σL) is known simply by measuring the contact angle between that liquid and PTFE (θPTFE) and using the equation above. The polar surface tension component for the liquid is then determined by difference (σAP=σL−σLD). The percent surface polarity is (%=σLP*100%/σL). See also F. M. Fowkes, Journal of Physical Chemistry, 67 (1963) 2538-2541. The polar liquid has a percent surface polarity of at least 24%, or at least 25%, or at least 26%, or at least 30%. The liquid core is substantially free of water. The liquid core may be completely free of water, that is, anhydrous. The liquid core contains a safe and effective amount of a basic active agent. The basic active agent has a pH of above 7 to about 14. Preferred compounds are weak base drugs or active agents. The basic active agent is present in the composition from about 0.001 percent to about 20 percent, or from about 0.01 percent to about 10 percent or from about 1 percent to about 5 percent by weight of the composition. Compounds suitable for use with the present invention are weak base drugs containing at least one amine functional group, which can be ionized to carry a positive charge. Non-limiting examples of the weak base drugs or active agents include benzocaine, procaine, lidocaine, codeine, ephedrine, epinephdrine, erythromycin, hydroquinone, scopolamine, and any compounds of plant extracts with at least one ionizeable amine functional group in the molecular structure. The liquid core contains from about 0.1% by weight to about 30%, for example from about 0.1% to about 20% or from about 0.1% to about 10%, or from about 1% to about 10%, or from about 1% to about 5% by weight of at least one acidic solubility enhancing agent that is not an active ingredient or benefit agent. This enables otherwise insoluble or difficult to solubilize basic actives or basic benefit agents to be solubilized in the core. Suitable solubility enhancing agents for basic active agents or benefit agents include acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, acrylic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, alkanesulfonic acid, an amino acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, boric acid, butyric acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, a fatty acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, hydroquinosulfonic acid, isoascorbic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, parabromophenylsulfonic acid, propionic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, tannic acid, tartaric acid, thioglycolic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, uric acid and mixtures thereof. The liquid core is substantially free of preservatives. The liquid core may be completely free of preservatives. The liquid core may be a single phase (one-phase). Alternatively, the liquid core may comprise multiple phases, for example the liquid core may be an emulsion or a suspension, while at least one basic active agent is completely dissolved in the polar liquid as the continuous phase of the liquid core. Alternatively, for a liquid core composed of an emulsion, at least one basic active agent is completely dissolved in the liquids that make up the liquid core, namely the basic active agent in its dissolved form is distributed among the internal phase liquid (e.g., oil phase), and the external polar liquid phase (e.g., glycerol, polyglycerol, or other polyol phase) is the continuous phase of the liquid emulsion core. In one embodiment, the liquid core is a substantially, or completely uniform single phase, namely, it is a homogeneous clear liquid containing no visibly detectable inhomogeneities, such as suspended droplets or particles when viewed with the unaided human eye at a distance of approximately 12 inches. The liquid core as a single phase may contain other organic liquids besides the polar liquid, so long as such organic solvents are soluble or substantially soluble, miscible or substantially miscible in the polar liquid to maintain the homogeneity and clarity of the liquid core. When other organic liquids that are partially soluble in or partially miscible with the polar liquid are used, their amounts should be below their saturation concentrations to ensure the liquid core remains a clear solution. The polar liquid may comprise one or more polyols. Such polyols include, but are not limited to glycerol (glycerin), polyglycerols, glycols, polyglycols, and mixtures thereof. Examples of polyglycerols include, but are not limited to diglycerol (diglycerin), triglycerol (polyglcerin-3 or polyglycerol-3), tetraglycerol (polyglycerin-4 or polyglycerol-4), other polyglycerols (polycerol-n, where n>4), and mixtures thereof. Examples of glycols include, but are not limited to propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, butylene glycol and its isomers (e.g., 1,2-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol and 2,3-butanediol), hexylene glycol and its isomers, propanediol, dipropylene glycol, ethoxydiglycol, methylpropanediol, isopentyldiol, and mixtures thereof. Examples of polyglycols include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, namely, molecular weights ranging from 300 g/mol to Ser. No. 10/000,000 g/mol, (e.g., PEG-200, PEG-400, PEG-1000, PEG-2000 PEG-4000, PEG-6000), polypropylene glycol (PPG) of various molecular weights, and mixtures thereof. The polar liquid may comprise a combination of a polyol with one or more other organic liquids. Such organic liquids include, but are not limited to alcohols, isosorbides, esters, ethers, lactones, and any organic compounds acceptable for therapeutic, cosmetic or personal product applications and capable of maintaining the percent surface polarity of the polar liquid at 24% or above. Examples of alcohols include, but are not limited to ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, octyldocanol, hexyldecanol, butyloctanol, and mixtures thereof. Examples of isosorbides include, but are not limited to dimethyl isosorbide, diethyl isosorbide, ethylmethyl isosorbide, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the isosorbide is an alkyl ester of isosorbide, such as dimethyl isosorbide. Examples of esters include, but are not limited to benzyl benzoate, triacetin, glycerol trioctanoate, diethyl phthalate, and mixtures thereof. Examples of ethers include, but are not limited to dicapryl ether, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, and mixtures thereof. Examples of lactones include but are not limited to gluconolactone. In one embodiment of the invention, the polar liquid is a mixture of a glycerol or polyglycerol with one or more glycols or polyglycols. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the polar liquid is a mixture of a glycerol or polyglycerol with one or more alcohols. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the polar liquid is a mixture of a glycerol or polyglycerol with one or more isosorbides. Preferably, the polar liquid comprises a glycerol, polyglycerol, or a mixture thereof. The amount of glycerol, polyglycerol, or mixture thereof may be about 50% to about 100%, or more than about 70%, or more than about 80%, or 85% or more, by weight of the polar liquid of the liquid core. The remainder of the liquid core may be one or more organic liquids such as non-glycerol polyols, alcohols, or isosorbides. In one embodiment, the liquid core may further comprise at least one hydrophilic polymer, e.g., natural or synthetic hydrophilic polymers. Such hydrophilic polymer may be soluble or partially soluble in the liquid core. Suitable hydrophilic polymers include, but are not limited to, homo- and copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone (e.g., PVP, or PVP/PVA copolymer), homo- or copolymers of vinyl alcohol (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol or PVA), polyacrylamide, homo- or copolymers of acrylic and/or methacrylic acids, and salts and esters thereof (e.g., CARBOPO/CARBOMER 934, 940, 941, 980, 1342, and 1382, and ULTREZ 10 and 21), cellulosic polymers (e.g., hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, carboxy ethyl cellulose), polyurethanes, starch and its derivatives, and synthetic and natural gums (e.g., gum arabic or xanthan gum). Preferred hydrophilic polymers are acrylate polymers and copolymers, particularly polyacrylate neutralized by anhydrous neutralizers. Polyvinyl either or methylvinylether/maleic anhydride copolymer (e.g. Gantrez® AN-119, 139, 149 etc) Incorporation of such polymers in the liquid core enhances interactions between the liquid core and the hydrophobic particles of the shell, thereby facilitating core-shell particle formation and improving the physical stability of the core/shell particles, which prevents premature particle collapse and liquid leakage during storage. If used, the amount of the hydrophilic polymer is usually up to about 10%, or equal to or less than about 5%, or equal to or less than about 3%, or equal to or less than about 2%, by weight of the liquid core. In general, the liquid core may contain any additional ingredients (e.g., active agents or formulation excipients) soluble or dispersible in the polar liquid or its components, provided the additional ingredients do not impair the percent surface polarity of the liquid core. Pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable active agents or excipients, such as extracts of plants or minerals, natural or synthetic compounds of small molecular weight or polymers, acids or bases (particularly week acids or bases) for acidity adjustment, buffers, chelators, antioxidants, thickeners or gelling agents can be used. In particular, the active agents or benefit agents are present in the liquid core. The liquid core may also comprise one or more emulsifying surfactants (emulsifiers) commonly used in pharmaceutical or cosmetic products. In one embodiment, the liquid core comprises an emulsion (e.g., simple emulsion, multi-emulsion, or nano-emulsion), in which there is at least one internal phase (e.g., oil phase), and at least one external polar liquid phase (e.g., glycerol, polyglycerol, or other polyol phase) as the continuous phase of the liquid core. The internal phase includes at least onelipophilic substance, which is a liquid at ambient temperature, and is essentially immiscible with the external polar liquid phases. Non-limiting exemplary oils include oils of plant origins (e.g., vegetable oils and oil extracts of plants—seeds, legumes or fruits), mineral oils, silicone oils/fluids and their derivatives, and any lipophilic solvents acceptable for pharmaceutical, topical or cosmetic products. The oils used for the internal oil phase of the liquid core may be volatile or nonvolatile in nature. Hydrophobic solvents suitable for use in the volatile, hydrophobic solvent component are selected from the group consisting of branched chain hydrocarbons, silicones, fatty acid esters, liquid branched chain fatty alcohols, and triglycerides (e.g., caprylic/capric triglyceride), isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, and mixtures, thereof. Preferred hydrophobic branched chain hydrocarbons useful as the solvent component herein contain from about 7 to about 14, more preferably from about 10 to about 13, and most preferably from about 11 to about 12 carbon atoms. Saturated hydrocarbons are preferred, although it is not intended to exclude unsaturated hydrocarbons. Examples of such preferred branched chain hydrocarbons include isoparaffins of the above chain sizes. Isoparaffins are commercially available form Exxon Chemical Co; examples include Isopar E (C.sub.8-C.sub.9 isoparaffins), Isopar™ H and K (C.sub.11-C.sub. 12 isoparaffins), and Isopar™ L (C.sub. 11-C.sub.13 isoparaffins) or mixtures thereof. Other suitable branched chain hydrocarbons are isododecane and isoundecane. Isododecane is preferred and is commercially available from Presperse, Inc. (South Plainfield, N.J., USA) as Permethyl™ M 99A. Preferred silicones useful as the volatile hydrophobic solvent component include volatile siloxanes such as phenyl pentamethyl disiloxane, phenylethylpentamethyl disiloxane, hexamethyl disiloxane, methoxy propylheptamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, chloropropyl pentamethyl disiloxane, hydroxypropyl pentamethyl disiloxane, octamethyl cyclotetrasiloxane, decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, and mixtures thereof. More preferred among the silicones are cyclomethicones, examples of which include hexamethyl disiloxane, octamethyl cyclo tetrasiloxane, decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane and cyclohexasiloxane, which are commonly referred to as D4, D5 and D6 cyclomethicone, respectively. The internal phase of the oil(s) in the emulsion liquid core is physically stabilized by the surfactants in the emulsion liquid core. In one embodiment, the liquid core comprises at least one polymeric surfactant having a molecular weight ranging from about 1,000 Daltons to 50,000 Daltons, including, but not limited to, homo-polymers such as poly(ethylene oxide), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and poly(vinyl alcohol), block and graft copolymer polymeric surfactants such as diblock or triblock polymeric surfactants known as PLURONICS manufactured by BASF (Germany) or SYNPERONIC PE manufactured by ICI (U.K.) consisting of two poly-A blocks of poly(ethylene oxide)(PEO) and one block of poly(propylene oxide)(PPO), and diblocks of polystyrene-block-polyvinyl alcohol, triblocks of poly(methyl methacrylate)-block poly(ethylene oxide)-block poly(methyl methacrylate), diblocks of polystyrene block-polyethylene oxide and triblocks of polyethylene oxide-block polystyrene-polyethylene oxide, as well as amphipathic graft copolymer consisting of a polymeric backbone B (polystyrene or polymethyl methacrylate) and several A chains (“teeth”) such as polyethylene oxide referred to as a “comb” stabilizer may be used.

No. 6,534,647 (including commercially available INUTEC SP1 (ORAFTI, Tienen, Belgium), hydrophobically modified dextran as disclosed by O. Carrier et al. (“Inverse emulsions stabilized by a hydrophobically modified polysaccharide”, Carbohydrate Polymers, 84(2011)599-604), hydrohobically modified starches from potato or tapioca as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,258,250, U.S. Pat.

The amount of hydrophobically modified polysaccharide surfactant used is generally from about 0.01% to about 20%, or from about 0.1% to about 10%, or from about 0.5% to about 5%, or from about 0.1% to about 1%, by weight of the liquid core. Other useful surfactants are described by T. Tadros (“Polymeric Surfactants in Disperse Systems”, Advances in Colloid and Interface Science, 147-148,2009, page 281-299), and R. Y. Lochhead and S. Jones (“Polymers in Cosmetics: Recent Advances”, Article 2004/07, Happi.com). In one embodiment, the composition comprises at least one surfactant typically used to prepare oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,533. The liquid core may comprise from about 0.05% to about 5%, or from about 0.05% to about 1%, by weight of such surfactant. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the surfactant assists in dispersing the hydrophobic component in the polar liquid. The surfactant, at a minimum, must be hydrophilic enough to disperse in the hydrophilic component. Preferred surfactants are those having an HLB of at least about 8. The exact surfactant chosen will depend upon the pH of the composition and the other components present. The surfactant can be any of the anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants cationic surfactants and mixtures clearly as are well known in the art. Examples of nonionic surfactants that are useful herein are those that can be broadly defined as condensation products of long chain alcohols, e.g. C8-30 alcohols, with sugar or starch polymers, i.e., glycosides. These compounds can be represented by the formula (S)n—O—R wherein S is a sugar moiety such as glucose, fructose, mannose, and galactose; n is an integer of from about 1 to about 1000, and R is a C8-30 alkyl group. Examples of long chain alcohols from which the alkyl group can be derived include decyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, and the like. Examples of these surfactants include those wherein S is a glucose moiety, R is a C8-20 alkyl group, and n is an integer of from about 1 to about 9. Commercially available examples of these surfactants include decyl polyglucoside (available as APG 325 CS from Henkel) and lauryl polyglucoside (available as APG 600 CS and 625 CS from Henkel). Other useful nonionic surfactants include the condensation products of alkylene oxides with fatty acids (i.e. alkylene oxide esters of fatty acids). These materials have the general formula RCO(X)nOH wherein R is a C10-30 alkyl group, X is —OCH2CH2— (i.e. derived from ethylene glycol or oxide) or —OCH2CHCH3— (i.e. derived from propylene glycol or oxide), and n is an integer from about 6 to about 200. Other nonionic surfactants are the condensation products of alkylene oxides with 2 moles of fatty acids (i.e. alkylene oxide diesters of fatty acids). These materials have the general formula RCO(X)nOOCR wherein R is a C10-30 alkyl group, X is —OCH2CH2— (i.e., derived from ethylene glycol or oxide) or —OCH2CHCH3— (i.e. derived from propylene glycol or oxide), and n is an integer from about 6 to about 100.

The Shell The shell comprises hydrophobic particles. As used herein, “hydrophobic” includes both hydrophobic particles per se and hydrophobized particles obtained by reaction of the surface of hydrophilic particles with a hydrophobic surface modifying agent. Useful hydrophobized particles include, but are not limited to, silicone- or silane-coated powders, or fluoropolymer-coated powders, such as talc, kaolin, mica, sericite, dolomite, phlogopite, synthetic mica, lepidolite, biotite, lithia mica, vermiculite, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, aluminum silicate, barium silicate, calcium silicate, magnesium silicate, strontium silicate, tungstenic acid metal salts, magnesium, silica, zeolite, barium sulfate, calcined calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate, fluorapatite, hydroxyapatite, titania, fumed titania, zinc oxide, alumina and fumed alumina. Other hydrophobic particles include, but are not limited to, particles of hydrophobic compounds or polymers, such as solid long chain fatty acids and their esters, alcohols, and metal salts (e.g., stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, and magnesium stearate), hydrophobic waxes (e.g., paraffin wax and beeswax), and fluoropolymers (e.g., polyvinylfluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polytetrafluoroethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, perfluoroalkoxy polymer, fluorinated ethylene-propylene, polyethylenetetrafluoroethylene, polyethylenechlorotrifluoroethylene, perfluorinated elastomer, fluorocarbon, chlorotrifluoroethylenevinylidene fluoride and perfluoropolyether. Among these, hydrophobized silica particles that form a three dimensional network, an aggregated structure, are a preferred shell material. The silica may be a precipitated silica or a fumed silica, the latter being preferred. Fumed silica is obtained in a flame hydrolysis or flame oxidation process. Its purity is higher than 99 wt %, usually higher than 99.8 wt %. Fumed silica usually forms a three-dimensional network of aggregated primary particles and is porous. The fumed silica primary particles bear hydroxyl groups at their surface and are nonporous. Other hydrophobic fumed metal oxides may also be used, such as hydrophobic fumed titanium oxide and aluminum oxide, such as Aeroxide.TiO2 T805, and Aeroxide Alu C805 (both from EVONIK, Piscataway, N.J.). Precipitated and fumed silica particles, as well as other hydrophilic particles may be hydrophobized in a subsequent step. Procedures for this step are known to the person skilled in the art. WO2011/076518 discloses these and other hydrophobic or hydrophobized silica particles suitable for use as the shell material of the present invention. Hydrophobic surface modifying agents include silanes, including organosilanes, holoorganosilanes, and cyclinc polysiloxanes, which may be used individually or as a mixture. Examples of hydrophobic surface modifying agents include octyltrimethoxysilane, octyltriethoxysilane, hexamethyldisilazane, hexadecyltrimethoxysilane, hexadecyltriethoxysilane, dimethylpolysiloxane, nonafluorohexyltrimethoxysilane, tridecafluorooctyltrimethoxysilane, and tridecafluorooctyltriethoxysilane. With particular preference, it is possible to use hexamethyldisilazane, octyltriethoxysilane and dimethyl polysiloxanes. The hydrophobic particles may be hydrophobized silica particles having a BET surface area of 30 m2/g to 500 m2/g, or 100 m2/g to 350 m2/g. Due to the reaction with the surface modifying agent these particles may contain 0.1 to 15 wt %, usually 0.5 to 5 wt %, of carbon. Examples of useful hydrophobic particles include AEROSIL® R104 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane; 150 m2/g; 55); AEROSIL® R106 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane; 250 m2/g; 50), AEROSIL® R202 (polydimethylsiloxane; 100 m2/g; 75), AEROSIL® R805 (octylsilane; 150 m2/g; 60), AEROSIL® R812 (hexamethyldisilazane; 260 m2/g; 60), AEROSIL® R812S (hexamethyldisilazane; 220 m2/g; 65), and AEROSIL® R8200 (hexamethyldisilazane; 150 m2/g; 65). The indications in parenthesis refer to the surface modifying agent, the approximate BET surface area and the approximate methanol wettability. It may also be beneficial to use hydrophobized fumed silica particles in compacted form or as granules. Other suitable hydrophobic particles include fine inorganic, organic, or polymeric fine powders coated with silicone, silane or fluoro-compounds, which can be used alone or as mixture with hydrophobic silica or hydrophobic fumed silica powder. The amount of hydrophobic particles in the powder is about 2% to about 30%, or about 2.5% to about 20%, or about 3% to about 10%, or about 3% to about 8%, by weight based on the total weight of powder (comprising core/shell particles). In one embodiment, the shell consists of hydrophobized fumed silica particles that are obtained by reacting a hydrophilic fumed silica having a BET surface area of from 30 to 500 m2/g. In another embodiment, the hydrophobized fumed silica particles are obtained by reacting a hydrophilic fumed silica having a BET surface area from 270 to 330 m2/g with hexamethyldisilazane to give hydrophobized fumed silica particles having a BET surface area of from 200 to 290 m2/g and a carbon content of 2 to 4 wt % and methanol wettability of at least 50. In one embodiment, active agents and/or additional ingredients are present in the shell. Second Powder The powder comprising core/shell particles may be mixed with a second powder. The mixing process is usually done during the product manufacturing process. However, the mixing process may also be carried out post-manufacturing by a user prior to use. In this case, the second powder and powder comprising core/shell particles may be packaged in a dual chamber container or separate containers. In one embodiment, the second powder comprises one or more solid active agents, liquid actives impregnated into absorbent powder materials, solid cosmetic/pharmaceutical formulation excipients, or liquid cosmetic/pharmaceutical formulation excipients impregnated into absorbent powder materials. Solid active agents that may be used in the second powder include unstable actives such as certain vitamins (e.g., ascorbic acid), and natural extracts containing antioxidants suitable for use in the compositions of this invention, include, but not limited to plant extracts containing flavonoids, phenolic compounds, flavones, flavanones, isoflavonoids, mono, di- and tri-terpenes, sterols and their derivatives. Examples of such plant extracts include grape seed, green tea, pine bark and propolis extracts and legume extracts and the like. Absorbent powder materials include pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable porous powders such as silica and fumed silica, powders of starches, and clays, synthetic and natural fibers, as well as the materials described as useful for the hydrophobic particles of the shell. Method of Making Core/Shell Particles A single phase liquid core can be made by simple blending or mixing of the liquid ingredients until uniform. High shearing is not required for this step, as blending of miscible liquids does not require high energy. The liquid mixing for this step may be done with equipment such as blenders, lab scale mixers, or homogenizers. The sample may be heated in cases where an active agent contained therein requires higher temperature to dissolve in the liquid mixture. The resulting homogeneous liquid can be converted to a powder by mixing with the hydrophobic particles of the shell under high shear, such as with a blender or a rotor-stator mixer or other inline high rotational speed mixers. It is preferred to run the powderization step with all contents at room temperature or below. In the case of a liquid core comprising an emulsion, the ingredients of the liquid core, including immiscible liquids, and/or active agents, and emulsifiers are mixed together under high shear until an emulsion is formed. The mixing for this step may be done with equipment such as blenders or homogenizers. The sample may be heated in cases where the active agent requires a higher temperature to dissolve in the liquid. The resulting emulsion can be converted to a powder by mixing with the hydrophobic particles under high shear, such as with a blender or a rotor-stator mixer or other inline high rotational speed mixers. It is preferred to run the powderization step with all contents at room temperature or below. Methods of using high rotational speed mixers for powder-liquid mixing to prepare the core/shell compositions are known in the art. The energy of mixing should be high enough to break the liquid into fine droplets to be covered or encapsulated by the hydrophobic powder shell. L. Forny et. al. (“Influence of mixing characteristics for water encapsulation by self-assembling hydrophobic silica nanoparticles,” Powder Technology 189, 2009, pages 263-269) describe the method and requirements for such preparation, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

For ingestible compositions comprising the powder of the invention, hydrophobic fumed silica, AEROSIL 972 Pharma, from EVONIK DEGUSSA CORPORATION, is particularly suitable for use as the hydrophobic particles of the shell. EXAMPLES Examples are set forth below to further illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of carrying it out. However, the invention should not be considered as being limited to the details thereof. Example 1 Preparation of 5% Minoxidil Powder A powder of total weight of 200 g was made following the procedures and composition below (in weight %): 1. 5% of citric acid, 82% of glycerin, and 5% of minoxidil powder were added to a glass container and mixed until the solution was clear at room temperature.2. The above liquid mixture was added into a high speed blender (e.g. Oster Blender model BCBG08). 8% of fumed silica (e.g. AEROSIL R812S, Evonik Degussa) was added at room temperature and the mixture was blended at the highest setting for about 10-20 seconds, yielding an off-white powder. Example 2 In Vitro Skin Permeation of 5% Minoxidil Compositions Through Human Cadaver Skin A skin penetration study evaluated the penetration of minoxidil into different skin layers for the inventive cream powder sample prepared as disclosed in Example 1 vs. a commercially available 5% minoxidil solution sample (Men's Rogaine Extra Strength Hair Regrowth Treatment, 5% Minoxidil solution) A well-known Franz diffusion cell method (as taught in US20020006418 A1, which is hereby incorporated by reference) was used. Franz cells had a diameter of 0.5 cm2 and a volume of liquid receptor of 5 ml. A magnetic stirrer bar was added in the donor compartment. The liquid receptor was filled with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. Air bubbles in the donor compartment were removed. The system was thermostated at 37° C. above a magnetic stirrer to ensure the homogeneity of the liquid receptor during the experiment. A cadaver skin sample from a commercial tissue bank (Ohio Valley Tissue and Skin Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, dermatomed to approximately 0.4 mm) was cut to fit the glass diffusion cell and mounted skin on the Franz cell. A test sample of 20 microliters was applied on the skin surface. Samples were collected from the receptor compartment at scheduled time points of 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours. At the end of the study the skin surface was washed with a cotton swab of liquid receptor (PBS). After washing, skin extraction was performed either on full skin or on separated skin layers of epidermis and dermis. Samples collected from the receptor compartment and from the skin extraction were analyzed for minoxidil levels with a Waters High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with the procedure listed below. The results are shown in Table 1. The final average minoxidil levels in different skin layers are reported in micrograms (μg) for 3 different replicates. A minoxidil mass balance study was also conducted and the % of recovery of minoxidil was better than 95% for both the control and the inventive formulation. TABLE 1 Powder-to- Commercial liquid 5% 5% Minoxidil Ratio of Minoxidil: Minoxidil Composition Powder-to- Time Solution Example 1 liquid/Commercial (hr) (microgram) (microgram) solution Cumulative 0 0.0 0.0 — Minoxidil in 3 26.5 37.8 1.4 Receptor 6 48.5 92.1 1.9 Dermis 6 8.7 17.5 2.0 Epidermis 6 14.8 18.9 1.3 Tapes 6 18.5 13.5 — Wash 6 737.0 629.9 — % 6 95.5 95.3 — Recovered Because the target tissue for topical minoxidil delivery is the hair follicles (hair “roots”) residing deep in the dermis, only minoxidil that penetrated into and cross the dermis layer could reach the hair follicles, and therefore, are of practical significance. It is surprising that the powder-to-liquid composition of the present invention has enhanced minoxidil delivery deep into the human skin significantly (i.e., by about 100% into the dermis which is where the hair bulb is located) in comparison to the commercial minoxidil solution of the same drug concentration, as demonstrated by the results in Table 1. This is an unexpected finding since the commercial minoxidil solution contains significant amount of two well known skin permeation enhancers, ethanol (30%) and propylene glycol (50%) whereas the powder-to-liquid composition of the present invention contains none of these skin permeation enhancers, but only glycerin. Glycerin is not generally regarded as a skin permeation enhancer. HPLC Procedure for Minoxidil Quantification A HPLC System (Waters Alliance® HPLC system) was used to measure minoxidil with UV absorption response at 286 nm. A Luna 5 μM C18(2) 250×4.6-mm HPLC column (Phenomenex) was used to separate the minoxidil analyte from other impurities in the extract samples for surface rinse, stripped tape, epidermis, dermis, and receptor solution. The mobile phase was an isocratic 80% (70:29:1 water/methanol/acetic acid—pH 3.3): 20% methanol. Example 3 Mice Hair Growth Study Procedure An in vivo hair growth study was conducted in a mouse model similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,913 B1. Five female mice (C3H mice, Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Kingston, N.Y) were included for each test article. The mice were shaved with a short hair clipper to hairless on their back (2×5 cm2 area) at the start of the study. The test articles were applied to the shaved areas of the mice daily at 0.2 ml per dose. Both the hair anagen phase and the hair coverage were observed visually and recorded daily for each mouse's hair condition (Telogen phase: resting phase in hair growth cycle—shaved skin shows no dark hair bulbs/roots; Anagen phase: anagen follicles, i.e. follicles in the growth state of the hair growth cycle—shaved skin shows dark hair bulbs/roots) As shown in Table 2, the composition according to the present invention resulted in hair follicles turning from resting state to growth state in about four days before the commercially available composition. As shown in Table 3, the composition according to the present invention started growing hair sooner and grew more hair than the commercially available composition.
