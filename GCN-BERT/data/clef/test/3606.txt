DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of the tobacco processing system 1 according to the invention. The tobacco processing system 1 comprises a tobacco storage 37 for storing tobacco. In use, tobacco is supplied into the tobacco storage 37 (arrow 100). This is in general performed mechanically, but may also be performed manually. The tobacco in the tobacco storage 37 is transferred to a dosing device 36 (arrow 101). The dosing device 36 produces doses of a predetermined amount of tobacco and transfers the doses of tobacco to a weighing device 38 (arrow 102). The weighing device 38 weighs the doses of tobacco. The approved doses containing the right amount of tobacco are transferred into tobacco holders 62 of a transport device 32 (arrow 103). Each tobacco holder 62 holds one dose of tobacco. The disapproved doses containing a different amount of tobacco are discharged (arrow 104). The tobacco holders 62 are trays 21, and the transport device 32 is a tray transporter 20 configured to move the trays 21 through the processing system 1. The trays 21 are interconnected to form an endless series of trays 21. The endless chain of trays 21 is circulated along a predetermined path. The direction of the movement of the trays 21 is indicated by the arrows 24. After receiving a dose of tobacco, the trays 21 are moved to an additive supply unit 39. The additive supply unit 39 discharges a specific amount of additive in the tray 21 and on the tobacco (arrow 105). The additive may be selected to enhance the flavour of the tobacco. The additive may comprise one or more spices and/or one or more herbs. The additive may for example comprise mint and/or ginger and/or sugar. The additive may be in a fluid form or in a solid form containing small particles. The trays 21 holding the tobacco and additive are subsequently transported to the tobacco mixing device 3. The mixing device 3 comprises a mixing housing 7 which encloses the tobacco and additive to form a mixing chamber 8 in which the tobacco and additive are mixed and a gas stream unit 9 which is operatively connected to the mixing housing 7 and configured to provide a gas stream 10 which moves the tobacco and additive through the mixing chamber 8. This way an effective mixing of the tobacco and additive is achieved. The tobacco storage 37, dosing device 36 and weighing device 38 form, in cooperation with the transport device 32, the tobacco supplier 5 which supplies the tobacco to the mixing device 3. The additive supply unit 39 forms, in cooperation with the transport device 32, the additive supplier 6 which supplies the additive to the mixing device 3. The mixing housing 7 is formed by a holding member 17 for holding the tobacco and additive and a closing member 18 placed in a closing positing 19 in which the closing member 18 is in contact with the holder member 17 such that the tobacco and additive is enclosed by the holding member 17 and the closing member 18. The holding member 17 is formed by one of the tobacco holders 62, more specifically one of the trays 21. The mixing device 3 is configured to provide the gas stream 10 in the mixing chamber 8 while the closing member 18 is located in the closing position 19 and moved along with the tray 21. The mixing device 3 comprises a member mover 22 to place the closing member 18 in the closing position 19 on one of the moving trays 21 while moving the closing member 18 along with the tray 21 over a predetermined distance. The predetermined distance is chosen such that there is sufficient time to mix the tobacco and additive with the gas stream 10 provided by the gas stream unit 9. The gas stream unit 9 comprises a controller 11 to control the gas stream in the mixing chamber. After the mixing, the trays 21 holding the mixed tobacco and additive is transported to a packaging device 25. The mixed tobacco and additive is transferred to the packaging device 25 (arrow 107). The mixed tobacco and additive is transferred by tilting the trays 21 at a specific location above the packaging device 25 (arrow 40). The packaging device 25 places the doses of tobacco mixed with the additive in tobacco packages. Sealed packages of mixed tobacco and additive leave the packing device 25 (arrow 108). FIG. 2 shows the additive supply unit 39, transport device 32 and mixing device 3 of a further embodiment of the tobacco processing system 1 according to the invention. The processing system 1 of FIG. 2 differs from the one shown in FIG. 1, in that the tobacco mixing device 3 is configured to mix the tobacco and additive of more than one tobacco holders 62, more specifically trays 21, simultaneously. The FIGS. 3 and 4a-d show the transport device 32 and mixing device 3 of FIG. 2. The gas stream unit 9 and controller 11 are not shown in the FIG. 2-4 in order to obtain a detailed view on the functioning of the mixing device 3 and its member mover 22. The mixing device 3 comprises ten closing members 18 and is configured to mix the tobacco and additive of ten trays 21 simultaneously. The member mover 22 is configured to place each of the closing members 18 in the closing position 19 on one of the moving trays 21 while moving the closing members 18 along with the trays 21 over a predetermined distance. The mixing device 3 is configured to provide the gas stream 10 in the mixing chambers 8 while the closing members 18 are located in the closing position 19 and moved along with the trays 21. The mixing houses 7 of the different mixing chambers 8 may be operatively connected to one or several gas stream units 9. The member mover 22 moves each of the closing members 18 along an endless path in which, after being moved along with the trays 21 while being in the closing position 19 on one of the trays 21, the closing member 18 is moved back in the opposite direction of the movement of the trays 21 while being located at a distance from the trays 21 in order to be placed in the closing position 19 on a further one of the trays 21 and to repeat the cycle. The endless path of one of the closing members 18 is indicated by the arrows 41. The member mover 22 is configured to move the closing members 18 synchronously in the same direction such that the closing members 18 together with several of the trays 21 form multiple mixing chambers 8. In FIG. 4a each of the closing members 18 is placed in the closed position 19 on one of the trays 21 holding the tobacco and additive. From this starting position, the closing members 18 are moved along with the trays 21 over a predetermined distance. During this movement, the gas stream 10 for mixing the tobacco and additive is provided in each of the mixing chambers 8 formed by the closing members 18 in the closing position 19 on the trays 21. After that, the closing members 18 are moved at a distance from the trays 21 holding the mixed tobacco and additive (FIG. 4b) and subsequently in the opposite direction of the movement of the trays 21 (FIGS. 4c and 4d). The closing members 18 will be moved back to the starting position shown in FIG. 4a, in which the closing members 18 will be positioned in closing position 19 on the next set of trays 21 to repeat the cycle. The movement of the closing members 18 and the trays 21 are tuned so that every dose of tobacco is processed once. This means that when passing the mixing device 3, no tray 21 is missed of treated more than once. The closing members 18 are connected to a member frame 44. The member movers 22 comprises gear wheel 42 which are driven by a drive unit (not shown) and are interconnected with gear chains 43. The member frame 44 is connected to several of the gear chains 43 such that the member frame 44 follows the movement of said gear chains 43. This way the closing members 18 move along their endless path. It will be clear to the skilled person that many different arrangements can be used to achieve the required movement of the closing members 18. FIG. 5 shows a view in cross section of a mixing housing of the processing system of FIG. 2. The mixing housing 7 is formed by the tray 21 and the closing member 18. The closing member 18 is positioned in the closing position 19, such that the tobacco 2 and additive 4 is enclosed by the tray 21 and the closing member 18. The tray 21 and the closing member 18 define the mixing chamber 8. The closing member 18 comprises a resilient element 48 which is placed in contact with the tray 21 to seal the mixing chamber 8. The mixing housing 7 comprises gas openings 12 which are operatively connected with the gas stream unit 9 via a gas duct 49. The gas openings 12 are provided in the closing member 18. The gas openings 12 are positioned to create a circulating gas stream (arrows 10) in the mixing chamber 8. The mixing housing 7 comprises inner housing walls 13 which define the mixing chamber 8 and are formed to facilitate the circulating flow of the gas stream. The tray 21 (as being the holding member 17) comprise a first inner space 53 wherein the tobacco 2 is positioned. The closing member 18 comprises a second inner space 54. The mixing chamber 8 is formed by the first inner space 53 and second inner space 54. The mixing device 3 is configured to lift the tobacco 2 and additive 4 from the first inner space 53 into the second inner space 54 with the gas stream 10. The gas stream unit 9 comprises a controller 11 to control the gas stream 10 in the mixing chamber 8 such that a pulsating gas stream 10 is provided. The pulsating gas stream has around three gas stream pulses per second. In other examples, the pulsating gas stream has between two and five gas stream pulses per second. This facilitates the mixing of the tobacco 2 and additive 4. The mixing housing 7 comprises further gas openings 16 which are positioned to provided a further gas stream 45 in a direction transverse to the circulating gas stream 10. This tends to create an improved mixing of the tobacco 2 and additive 4 in the mixing chamber 8. The gas openings 12 and further gas openings 16 extend transverse to each other. The further gas openings 16 are located in the closing member 18. The further gas openings 16 are operatively connected to the gas stream unit 9 via a further gas duct 50. The gas steam unit 9 comprises a further controller 31 is configured to control the further gas stream 45 in the mixing chamber 8 such that a pulsating further gas stream 45 is provided. The pulsating further gas stream has around ten gas stream pulses per second. In other examples, the pulsating further gas stream has between five and fifteen gas stream pulses per second. The mixing housing 7 comprises a vent opening 34 to release an overpressure in the mixing chamber 8. The vent opening 34 is provided with a filter 35 to ensure that gas can pass through the vent opening 34 and the tobacco 2 and additive 4 remain in the mixing chamber 8. The gas steam 10 and further gas stream 45 have a velocity of around 120 m/s when leaving the gas openings 12 and further gas openings 16, respectively. In other examples of the processing system, the gas stream 10 and further gas stream 45 have a velocity of between 20 m/s and 200 m/s. In a further embodiment, the gas stream 10 and further gas stream 45 have a velocity of between 50 m/s and 150 m/s. The gas stream 10 and further gas stream 45 are air streams. In the embodiment of FIG. 5, the additive is added to the tobacco when the tobacco is located in the holding member 17, more specifically the tobacco holder 62. The additive supplier discharges the additive 4 in the holding member 17, more specifically the tobacco holder 62, before the closing member 18 is placed in the closing position 19. In the embodiments of the FIGS. 6 and 7, the additive is added to the tobacco when the tobacco is located in the mixing chamber 8. The additive supplier discharges the additive in the mixing chamber 8 while the closing member 18 is placed in the closing position 19 on the holding member 17, more specifically the tobacco holder 62. The processing system 1 of FIG. 6 differs from the one shown in FIG. 2, in that the additive supplier transfers the additive 4 in the mixing chamber 8 via a supply opening 46. The supply opening 46 is formed by the vent opening 34. In other example, the supply opening 46 is separate from the vent opening 34. The supply opening 46 can be opened or closed by a lid 47. The lid 47 is pivotally movable from a closing position into an open position, and vise versa (arrow 51). The lid 47 is formed by the filter 35 of the vent opening 34. For supplying the additive 4 in the mixing chamber 8, the lid 47 is moved to open the supply opening 46 in order to allow access to the additive 4. After that, the additive 4 is transferred into the mixing chamber 8 via the supply opening 46. During the mixing of the tobacco 2 and additive 4 by the gas stream 10, the supply opening 46 is closed by the lid 47. The processing system of FIG. 7 differs from the one shown in FIG. 2, in that the additive supplier transfers the additive 4 into the mixing chamber 8 via the further gas openings 16. In other examples, the additive 4 is discharged into the mixing chamber 8 via the at least one gas opening 12 and/or the at least one further gas opening 16. This way, the additive is transported into the mixing chamber 8 via the gas stream and/or further gas stream. This tends to be an efficient way of supplying an additive 4 in fluid form, more specifically in liquid form, into the mixing chamber 8. FIG. 8 shows the outer side of the closing member 18 and FIG. 9 shows the inner side of the closing member 18 of the processing system of FIG. 2.
