LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES Petunia sensu wijsman VARIETY DENOMINATION ‘DRAY307’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new Petunia cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor, Gavriel Danziger, in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. The objective of the breeding program was to produce new Petunia varieties for ornamental commercial applications. The cross resulting in this new variety was made during January of 2011. The seed parent is the unpatented, proprietary variety referred to as Petunia sensu wijsman. ‘cv. 8-1255’.The pollen parent is the unpatented, proprietary variety referred to as Petunia sensu wijsman ‘cv. 10-3970. The new variety was discovered in December of 2011 by the inventor in a group of seedlings resulting from the 2011 crossing, in a research greenhouse in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar was performed by vegetative cuttings. This was first performed at a research greenhouse in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel in January of 2012 and has shown that the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type in more than 25 successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The cultivar ‘DRAY307’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘DRAY307’ These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘DRAY307’ as a new and distinct Petunia cultivar: 1. Mounded, ball-shaped. 2. Very branched with medium vigor. 3. Flower color is yellow. 4. Flower size is large. 5. Abundant flowering. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY307’ are similar to plants of the seed parent, Petunia sensu wijsman ‘cv. 8-1255’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY307’ differs in the following; 1. Mounded, ball shape, compared to the semi upright shape of seed parent. 2. Larger far more branched plant. 3. Different flower color yellow compared to cream color of seed parent. 4. Larger flower size. 5. Greater amount of flowers. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY307’ are similar to plants of the pollen parent; Petunia sensu wijsman ‘cv. 10-3970’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY307’ differs in the following; 1. Ball shaped habit. 2. Smaller and less vigorous and branched plant 3. Flowers are yellow; flowers of pollen parent are greenish-yellow. 4. Smaller flower size. 5. Less abundant flowering. COMMERCIAL COMPARISON Plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY307’ are comparable to the variety Petunia ‘DANRAY1’ U.S. Plant Pat. No. 20,974. The two Petunia varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however, the new variety ‘DRAY307’ differs in the following: 1. Smaller flower size. 2. Yellow flowers. The comparator has white flowers. 3. Less vigor. 4. Shorter branches. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY307’ can also be compared to the commercial variety Petunia ‘DANRAY3’, unpatented. These varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however ‘DRAY307’ differs in the following: 1. Smaller flower size. 2. Yellow flowers. The comparator has light purple flowers with dark purple veins. 3. Less vigor. 4. Shorter branches. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photograph in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color a typical plant of ‘DRAY307’ grown in a greenhouse, in a 13 cm pot. Age of the plant photographed is approximately 3 months from a rooted cutting. FIG. 2 illustrates in full color a close up of a typical bloom of ‘DRAY307’. The photographs were taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques.
