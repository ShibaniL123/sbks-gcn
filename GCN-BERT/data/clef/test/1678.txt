The present invention relates to an oral care composition and a method of disinfecting the oral cavity. Background and Prior Art Oral hygiene is one of the most important aspects of personal care among consumers. Consumers all over the world use different types of products for oral care. People routinely brush their teeth with a toothbrush and a dentifrice which may be toothpaste or a toothpowder at least two times a day. Use of such brushing ensures maintaining good oral hygiene by minimising oral bacteria that accumulate in the mouth over the course of sleeping in the night or during the course of the day when people eat their food and consume beverages. Brushing, thus minimises problems like cavities, tartar, gingivitis, caries, and bad breath, also known as halitosis. In spite of brushing teeth twice a day, many people suffer from various forms of one or more of the above named diseases and this is believed to be caused by bacteria acting in the oral mucosa over the about twelve hour period between brushing. During such times, people resort to rinsing/ gargling their mouth with an antiseptic mouthwash. Most antiseptic mouthwashes contain a substantial amount of alcohol (e g. ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol) for killing oral bacteria. In solving the above oral care problems, the approach so far has been to use synthetic materials (e.g. Triclosan) which are believed by many consumers to be harsh on them. Consumers, more and more, especially of late, prefer using products that contain natural materials. Further, in many countries, culturally or otherwise, people are reluctant to using alcohol in their mouthwashes. The present inventors have been working on solving these problems and have come up with an oral care composition which includes natural materials that are found to interact synergistically with certain metal salts in killing S. mutans, a bacterium responsible for tooth decay. Essential oils actives have been cited in prior publications in oral care. JP2196718 (Kowa, 1989) discloses a liquid for external use having increased solubility and stability, containing 0.1 to 5% indomethacin and a 0.3 to 10% dissolution auxiliary as essential components, the dissolution auxiliary selected from limonene, pinene, camphene, cymene, citronellol, geraniol, nerol, linalool, terpineol, rhodinol, borneol, isoborneol, menthone, camphor, thymol, safrole, isosafrole, eugenol and isoeugenol. WO 00/ 00166 (Warner Lambert) discloses an oral composition that includes thymol, a zinc salt and a sweetener is disclosed. The oral composition has antitartar, antiplaque, antigingivitis efficacy, long lasting breath freshening and high consumer acceptability in spite of the presence of two ingredients, thymol and a zinc salt, that are known to taste bad. None of the publications, to date, teach that a mixture of antimicrobial essential oil actives thymol and terpineolwhen used along with a specific metal salt provides for fast acting anti-microbial action, in a synergistic way. The present inventive combination provides vastly improved and synergistic anti-bacterial efficacy as compared to a combination of zinc salt and thymol as disclosed in WO 00/00166. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative. Another object of the present invention is to provide for an antimicrobial composition that has relatively fast antimicrobial action in killing bacteria in the oral cavity. Summary of the Invention The first aspect of the present invention provides for an oral care composition comprising (i) 0.05 to 1 0% of an antimicrobial essential oil comprising thymol and terpineot, such that the composition comprises 0.01 to 5 % by weight thymol, and 0.01 to 5 % by weight terpiπeol; (ii) 0.01 to 10% of a zinc salt; and (lit) an orally acceptable base. The second aspect of the present invention provides for a method of disinfecting the oral cavity comprising the steps of (i) applying a composition of the first aspect onto the oral cavity; and (ii) cleaning the cavity to be substantially free of said composition. The third aspect of the present invention provides for use of a composition comprising (i) 0.05 to 1 0% of an antimicrobial essential oil comprising thymol and terpineol, such that the composition comprises 0.01 to 5 % by weight thymol, and 0.01 to 5 % by weight terpineol; and (ii) 0.01 to 10% of a zinc salt; for disinfecting the oral cavity.

The composition of the present invention most preferably comprises a mixture of 0.03 to 0.4% eugenol, 0.03 to 0.6% thymol, and 0.06 to 1.5% terpineol by weight of the composition. Zinc salt The composition of the invention comprises 0.01 to 10% of a zinc salt. Preferred zinc salts are zinc halide (preferably chloride or bromide), zinc sulphate, zinc acetate, or zinc phosphate. The composition preferably comprises 0.1 to 5% zinc salt. Orally acceptable base The antimicrobial composition comprises an orally acceptable base. The orally acceptable base depends on the format in which the oral care composition is delivered. Most suitable formats are an antiseptic mouthwash, a toothpaste or a toothpowder. Mouthwash When the composition is formulated as an antiseptic mouthwash, the orally acceptable base is water. The desired antibacterial efficacy in the mouthwash of the present invention can be obtained without the use of low molecular weight (C1 to C3) alcohols e.g. ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, i.e the composition is preferably substantially free of low molecular weight alcohol. By the term substantially free of low molecular weight alcohols is meant that the alcohol may be present in an amount which does not significantly affect the microbial kill. Preferably, C1 to C3 alcohols are present in less than 2%, more preferably less than 1% and most preferably absent from the composition of the invention. Thus, the invention provides an antimicrobial mouthwash composition according to the first aspect of the invention (i.e. comprising thymol, terpineol and a zinc salt) also comprising 80 to 99.9% water. The antimicrobial mouthwash composition of the invention preferably comprises 0,05 to 10%, more preferably 0.05 to 8 %, most preferably 0.5 to 5% of a surfactant by weight of the composition. The surfactant is preferably of the cationic, anionic, or zwitterionic class, most preferably of the cationic class. When anionic surfactant is present it is preferably chosen from alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of alkyl sulphonic acid, fatty acid, or alkyl ether sulphate. When zwitterionic surfactant is present it is preferably chosen from betaines, sulphobetains, hydroxyl sulphobetains, or amino carboxylates When a cationic surfactant is present it is benzalkonium chloride, alkyl pyridinium chloride or quaternary ammonium gemini surfactants. The antimicrobial mouthwash composition of the invention is used for disinfecting the oral cavity either by using the composition with no dilution or after diluting the composition with water. The preferred weight ratio of composition to water for the dilution step is in the range of 1:1 to 1:200, more preferably 1:5 to 1:50, further more preferably 1: 1 5 to 1:30 and ideally about 1:20. Toothpaste The composition of the invention may be delivered in a toothpaste format. When the composition is a toothpaste, the orally acceptable base is an abrasive which may be calcium carbonate or abrasive silica. When calcium carbonate is the abrasive, the toothpaste is in the opaque paste format. When abrasive silica is used, the toothpaste is usually delivered in the transparent gel format. Toothpastes also preferably comprise a surfactant in 2 to 15% by weight of the composition. Preferred surfactants are anionic or amphoteric in nature. Anionic surfactant is preferably an alkali metal alkyl sulphate, more preferably a sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS). Mixtures of anionic surfactants may also be employed. The amphoteric surfactant is preferably a betaine, more preferably an alkylamidopropyl betaine (wherein the alkyl group is a linear C10~C18 chain), and most preferably is cocoamidopropyl betaine (CAPB). Mixtures of amphoteric surfactants may also be employed. Suitable surfactant concentrations in oral care application are generally from about 2% to about 15%, preferably from about 2.2% to about 10%, more preferably from about 2.5 to about 5% by weight of the total composition. Opaque toothpaste When calcium carbonate is the abrasive, it is usually present in 15 to 70%, more preferably in 30 to 60% by weight of the composition. Calcium carbonate (also known as chalk) is available in many forms and some of these forms are used in oral care compositions. Two commonly used forms are FGNC (fine ground natural chalk) and PCC (precipitated calcium carbonate). Of the total chalk content in the oral care composition, FGNC, is generally present in 35 to 100% preferably from 75 to 100% and especially from 95 to 100%, the balance being PCC. Typically, the FGNC will comprise from 30 to 65%, preferably from 35 to 55% and most preferably from 40 to 55% by weight of the composition. FGNC generally comprises particles of weight-based median particle size ranging from 1 to 15 μm, preferably from 2 to 10 μm and especially from 4 to 7 μm. The composition may also include other known “non-chalk” abrasives to improve the abrasive action. Such abrasives include dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and silica. In addition to calcium carbonate, one can also include abrasive silica in opaque toothpastes for enhanced abrasive action. The abrasive silica may be included in 4 to 15%, preferably 6 to 12%, and further more preferably 7 to 10%. Alternatively perlite may be included in 0.0.1 to 2 %, preferably in 0.1 to 0.8%, further more preferably 0.3 to 0.7 % by weight of the composition. Water in these toothpastes is generally included in 15 to 40%, preferably 20 to 30% by weight of the composition. Preferred compositions include a humectant, e.g. xylitol, glycerol or sorbitol. Glycerol and sorbitol are particularly preferred. Preferably, the compositions include 0.1 to wt% humectant. More preferred compositions include 1 to 15 wt% humectants while further preferred compositions include 5 to 13 wt% humectants. The compositions preferably also include an alkali-metal bicarbonate salt. Preferably the alkali-metal bicarbonate salt is a sodium salt, from 1 to 30 wt%, more preferably from 2 to 20 wt% and especially from 3 to 8 wt%. Gel toothpaste Preferred compositions to prepare gel toothpaste comprise an abrasive silica. They preferably have a low refractive index in the range of 1.41 - 1.47, preferably 1.435 - 1.445, preferably having a weight mean particle size of between 5 and 15 micrometer, a BET (nitrogen) surface area of between 10 and 100 m2/g and an oil absorption of about 70150 cm3/100 g. Typical examples of suitable low refractive index abrasive silicas are Tixosil 63 and 73 ex Rhone Poulenc; Sident 10 ex Degussa; Zeodent 113 ex Zeofinn; Zeodent 124 ex Huber, Sorbosil AC series supplied by Crosfield, for example Sorbosil ACII, Sorbosil AC39 and Sorbosil AC35, particularly Sorbosil AC 77 ex Crosfield Chemicals. The amount of these silicas in the composition generally ranges from 2-60% by weight, usually 2-20% by weight and more preferably 5 to 12 wt%. Thickening silica may also be incorporated in gel toothpastes. They are usually incorporated in 4 to 12 %, preferably. 5 to 10% by weight of the composition. Preferred grades are medium thickening silica such as MFIL {ex. Madhu Silica India), TC15 (from PQ Corp UK), and Zeodent 165 Ex. Huber, or Tixosil 43 from Rhodia. Water in these toothpastes is generally included in 8 to 14%, preferably 8 to 10% by weight of the composition. These amounts of water are exclusive of water which are incorporated in the composition from aqueous solutions of other ingredients e g. sorbitol. The compositions for any type of toothpaste (opaque or gel type) may also include an anti-caries agent, binders, thickeners, flavours, stabilizing agents, polymers, vitamins, buffers and anti-calculus agents. Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a toothpaste composition according to the first aspect of the invention, also comprising 2 to 70% of an abrasive selective from calcium carbonate or silica; and 8 to 40% water. Tooth powder Toothpowders usually have very high percentage of abrasives. Chalk (FGNC) is the most preferred one but PCC can also be used. Usual percentages of such abrasives are from 90 to 99.9%, preferably 90 to 95% by weight of the composition. Desired amount of foam is provided by including an anionic surfactant e.g. Sodium Lauryl Sulphate in the toothpowder composition. The surfactant may be incorporated from 2 to 3% in the composition. Other ingredients like silica or Sodium monofluoro phosphate may be included at up to about 1 weight℅ of the composition. Sweeteners such as xylitol, sorbitol, glycerol or sachhariπ may be included. Flavors such as spearmint or peppermint may be included at up to 1 weight℅ of the toothpowder composition. The present invention therefore also provides a toothpowder composition according to the first aspect of the invention, comprising 90 to 99.9% of an abrasive selected from calcium carbonate or silica. Thus, in the composition of the present invention the orally acceptable base is preferably selected from water, silica, or calcium carbonate. An aspect of the present invention provides for a method of disinfecting the oral cavity comprising the steps of (i)applying a composition of the invention on to the oral cavity; and (ii) cleaning the cavity to be substantially free of said composition. By cleaning is meant that the composition is substantially removed from the oral cavity. The composition, when in liquid form (e.g. a mouthwash) is simply spat out. When the composition is in powder, paste or gel form the composition may be rinsed off from the oral cavity using suitable amount of water. When the composition is a toothpaste, it is generally brushed on to the teeth or gums in the oral cavity before the step of rinsing. Rinsing is usually done by taking water and washing or gargling the mouth with this water. Yet another aspect of the present invention provides for use of a composition comprising (i) 0.05 to 1 0% of an antimicrobial essential oil comprising thymol and terpineol, such that the composition comprises 0.01 to 5 % by weight thymol, and 0.01 to 5 % by weight terpineol; and (ii) 0.01 to 10% of a zinc salt; for disinfecting the oral cavity. The invention preferably provides for non-therapeutic benefits. Examples The invention will now be demonstrated with examples. The examples are for purpose of illustration only and do not limit the scope of claims in any manner. Examples 1 to 5: Synergistic interaction of the ingredients of the composition of the invention Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is a Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic bacterium commonly found in the human oral cavity. S. mutans is the leading cause of dental caries (tooth decay) worldwide and is considered to be the most cariogenic of all of the oral streptococci. S. mutans, sticks to the surface of teeth and subsists on a diverse group of carbohydrates. While metabolising sugar and other energy sources, the microbe produces acid that causes cavities in teeth. Various compositions as shown in Table - 1 were prepared. The compositions listed in Table - 1 were used to test the efficacy as an antibacterial composition against S. mutans in a 15 second contact test in suspension, using the following procedure. The test bacteria S. mutans was grown overnight at 37°C in BHI broth under 5% CO2 (C02 incubator). Then the culture was processed and the cell density was adjusted at 620 nm to get the final count of 108 cfu/ml (0.3 OD). 9 ml of the compositions was taken in a sample container and 1 ml of processed culture was added to it. After a second contact time 1 ml of the above mixture was immediately neutralized in D/E broth. This was serially diluted in D/E broth and plated in BHI agar in duplicates. In case of the control, 1 ml of test culture was added to 9 ml of saline and was serially diluted and plated on BHI agar. After solidification, the plates were incubated at 37°C under 5% C02for 48 hrs. The residual colonies were counted after hours and the log reduction of bacteria with respect to the control sample was calculated. The data are compiled in Table 1.
