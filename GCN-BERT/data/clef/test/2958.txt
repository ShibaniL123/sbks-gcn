Step 6. tert-Butyl 5-(1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-6-cyano-3-iodo-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)-6-fluoro-3, 4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl 5-(6-cyano-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)-6-fluoro-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate (354.7 mg, 0.902 mmol) in DMF (6.0 ml) was added N-iodosuccinimide (304.2 mg, 1.352 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. for 2 h, and cooled to room temperature. Boc-anhydride (306.1 mg, 1.403 mmol) was added, followed by DMAP (31.6 mg, 0.259 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and then concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a yellow foamy solid (407.4 mg, 73%).
