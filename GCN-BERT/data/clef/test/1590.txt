WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 PATENT APPLICATION 29985/01-012 FLUID MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR CORONARY INTERVENTION FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The disclosure generally relates to fluid dispensing machines and, more particularly, relates to fluid dispensing machines for use with power actuated syringes. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE During medical procedures, fluids of different types need to be injected into human tissue and vascular structures. One such procedure is known as angiography. Angiography is a procedure used in the detection and treatment of abnormalities or restrictions in blood vessels, heart chambers and heart valves. During angiography, a radiographic image of a vascular structure is obtained by injecting radiographic contrast mateñal through a catheter into such a vessel, heart chamber, or heart valve. X-rays are then passed through the region of the body in which the contrast material was injected. The X-rays are absorbed by the contrast material causing a radiographic outline or image of the blood vessel containing the contrast material. The x-ray images of the blood vessels filled with the contrast material are usually recorded on the film or videotape and displayed on a fluoroscope monitor. The injection of the contrast or other fluids can be performed either manually or automatically. In both procedures, a catheter is inserted into a vessel, which in turn is connected to a fluid line leading to a manifold and in turn to an injector or syringe. WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 The plunger of the syringe is then either manually or automatically depressed to inject fluid through the fluid line, the catheter, and into the patient. In certain situations, it is necessary to dilute the concentration of contrast being injected into a patient. For example, in those patients with renal insufficiency incapable of processing concentrated contrast through their system, or in cases where a large amount of contrast is used, such as complicated coronary interventions (PTCA) or peripheral (PTA) cases with runoffs, direct injections of contrasts, are not possible. Accordingly, it is necessary to mix the contrasts and saline prior to injection to arrive at the appropriate dilution percentage. Such processes are necessarily slow and are currently difficult to achieve. In addition, during injections, it is desirable for the physician or technician to be provided with feedback as to the pressure within the vessel. This is commonly provided by way of a pressure transducer mounted relatively close to the injection apparatus. However, since a relatively long expanse of conduit exists between the catheter and the injector, typically on the order of four feet or more, pressure waveforms must be transmitted through the fluid contained within that conduit ail the way from the body of the patient, through the catheter, and back to the pressure transducer. Due to such distances, the waveforms may be substantially dampened by the time they reach the transducer thereby providing an inaccurate or poor signal for display to the physician. Furthermore, after an injection is made, and it is desired to remove the contrast from the injection system or change the fluid being injected, it is currently necessary to evacuate or aspirate the entire injection line. It would be advantageous if the waste WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 could be quickly removed, while at the same time limiting the total volume of waste fluid encountered by the system. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure, an injection system is provided which comprises a first power actuated injector, a second power actuated injector, a fitting, and a catheter. The first power actuated injector is adapted to inject a first fluid through a first fluid line having a distal end, and the second power actuated injector is adapted to inject a second fluid through a second fluid line having a distal end. The fitting has first and second inputs and an output, with the distal ends of the first and second fluid lines being connected to the first and second inputs of the fitting, respectively. The catheter is connected to the fitting output. In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, a method of injecting fluid is provided which comprises the steps of providing a first power actuated injector, providing a second power actuated injector, connecting first and second fluid lines to a single catheter, and actuating one of the first and second power actuated injectors. The first power actuated injector is adapted to transport a first fluid from a first receptacle through the first fluid line, while the second power actuated injector is adapted to transport a second fluid from a second receptacle through the second fluid line. These and other aspects and features of the disclosure will become more apparent upon reading the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an injection system constructed in accordance with the teachings of the disclosure; FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of an injection system constructed in accordance with the teachings of the disclosure; FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of an injection system in a first position; FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of an injection system in a second position; FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of an injection system in a third position; FIG. ó is a schematic representation of an injection system in a fourth position; and FIG. 7 is a schematic representation of an injection system in a fifth position. While the disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative constructions, certain illustrative embodiments thereof have been shown in the drawings and will be described below in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intention to limit the disclosure to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover ail modifications, alternative constructions, and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring now to the drawings, an injection system constructed in accordance with the teachings of the disclosure is generally depicted by reference numeral While the system 20 is described herein in conjunction with angiographie procedures WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 wherein radiopaque contrast is utilized, it is to be understood that the teachings of the disclosure can be utilized to construct injection systems for any other type of fluid as well. In the paragraphs that follow, the relative positions of the components of the system 20 will be described in terms of being "upstream" or "downstream" from one another. It is to be understood that if two components A and B are provided with component A being closer to a patient, component A is said to be "downstream" of component B, and component B is said to be "upstream" of component A. The injection system 20 includes, in the first embodiment of FIG. 1, a first injector 22 and a second injector 24 adapted to draw fluid from a first fluid supply 26 and a second fluid supply 28, respectively. In the depicted embodiment, the first fluid supply 26 may be a supply of contrast while the second fluid supply 28 may be a supply of saline. The saline and contrast are directed by the first and second injectors 22, 24 through first and second fluid lines 30 and 32, respectively. A bubble detector 33 may be provided to detect and/or remove gas entrained in the liquid of supplies 26 and 28. As used herein, solid lines are provided in the figures to illustrate fluid connections, while dashed lines are used to illustrate electrical connections. The first and second fluid lines 30, 32 include distal ends 34, 36, respectively, which may terminate at first and second inputs 38, 40, respectively, of a Y-shaped fitting 42. The Y-shaped fitting 42 further includes an outlet 44 connected to an output conduit 46. An advantage of using such a fitting having multiple inlets and one outlet is that multiple fluids can be supplied under pressure from multiple sources and be mixed in the fitting 42 prior to injection. Accordingly, the injected fluid can be tailored in terms of viscosity, concentration, etc., during the procedure without WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 requiring pre-mixing of same as is required by the prior art. Control valves 48 and may be provided within the first and second fluid lines 30, 32, respectively. It is to be understood that the fitting 42 need not be Y-shaped, and that in alternative embodiments may be T-shaped, or otherwise shaped to allow coupling of fluid lines as would be contemplated by one skilled in the art. Moreover, the control valves 48 and 50 may be provided in a variety of forms such as, but not limited to, check valves, pinch valves, or any other type of valve contemplated by one skilled in the art. The output conduit 46 terminates at a valve 52 having first and second inputs 54, 56 and an output 58. The input 54 is connected to the output conduit 46. The input 56 is connected to a medication supply 59. The output 58 is connected to a conduit 60 which leads to a medical device 62 which may be a catheter, or the like. Also depicted in FIG. 1 is a waste line 64 having an input 66 connected to the output conduit 46, and an output 68 connected to a waste receptacle 70. A pump 72 is operatively associated with the waste line 64 to draw fluid from the output conduit 46 and any fluid lines fluidically connected to the output conduit 46. It can therefore be seen that separate lines 30, 32 and 64 are supplied for the contrast, saline, and waste, respectively. This is advantageous in that when it is desired, for example, to inject saline after injecting contrast, and injection can occur immediately without first clearing the system of contrast from the prior injection. This is in direct opposition to the prior an wherein the contrast existing in the line (e. g., 4-5 ccs of fluid) would have to first be injected into the patient, or cleaned, prior to saline injection. Moreover, by providing the waste line 64 close to the medical device 62, when the device 62 is to be drained of waste, it can be done quickly and with far less waste. WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 Put another way, since prior art systems drain the device using a pump (run in reverse) mounted back by the injector, not only must the device be drained with prior art systems, but the entire line connecting the injector to the device must be drained as well, which is overcome by the present disclosure. This represents not only a large volume (e. g., 4-5 ccs) of waste, but a source of delay as well. A pressure sensor 74 may be positioned proximate the catheter 62. The pressure sensor 74 is shown connected to the catheter conduit 60. An advantage of positioning the pressure transducer 74 close to-the catheter 62 is that, unlike prior an systems, the pressure waveforms need not be communicated ail the way down the line to the injector and thus be subjected to substantial waveform dampening, but rather can be monitored before such dampening can occur and thus result in a much more accurate signal. The pressure sensor 74 generates a signal 76 representative of fluid pressure within the output conduit 46. The signal 76 is communicated to a controller 78 which in turn generates a display signal 78 for transmission to an operator interface module 79, enabling the physician or technician to monitor pressure. In alternative embodiments, the pressure signal 76 may be used by the controller 78 in determining or modifying control signais 80, 82 for controlling actuators 84 and 86 connected to the first and second injectors 22 and 24, respectively. The actuators 84 and 86 may be any suitable actuating device such as, but not limited to, motor driven, hydraulically powered, or pneumatically powered plungers. However, it is to be understood that the control signais 80, 82 are pñmañly generated by the operator depressing or otherwise actuating buttons, keypads, or the like for varying the ratio of a first fluid (e. g., contrast) to a second fluid (e. g., saline), WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 and that the pressure signal 76 is provided mainly to enable the physician to monitor pressure. The operator interface module 88 is associated with the controller 78 to enable a user to affect operation of the system 20 and provide the user with valuable feedback as to the operation of the system 20. For example, the operator interface module 88 may include a display screen such as a glass plasma, liquid crystal, or cathode ray tube display, or the like, and/or a plurality of input/output devices such as the aforementioned keypad, buttons, mouse orthe like for entering and receiving data. The controller may be electrically connected to valves 48, 50, 90, 92, 94, and 96 to monitor the valves, or control movement of fluid flow directions. In operation, the system 20 is able to inject fluid or fluids through the catheter 62 and into a patient (not shown). By employing the first and second injectors 22 and 24, first and second fluids, such as saline and contrast, can be sequentially injected with substantially no down time for the system 20. In addition, the saline and contrast can be simultaneously injected by simultaneously operating the first and second injectors 22. This in turn forces saline and contrast into the fitting 42 and automatically mixes the fluids. Moreover, as opposed to existing systems which employ a single injector for contrast and a peristaltic pump for saline/flushing, the separate injector dedicated to saline injection enables smooth flow without the pulsating flow associated with peristaltic pumps. When the system is to be drained, the separate waste line 64 can be utilized along with pump 72 to quickly and efficiently draw fluid out of the system 20 and ready the system 24 for additional injections. By providing the pressure sensor 74 WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 proximate the catheter 62, the signal 76 representative of fluid pressure within the catheter conduit 60 is more accurate and less susceptible to wave dampening. Referring now to FIG. 2, an alternative embodiment of an injection system is generally referred to by reference numeral 100. Wherein like elements are utilized, like reference numerals are employed. A difference in the altemative embodiment is that only a single injector 22 is employed. More specifically, the injector 22 is used to inject contrast, in the depicted embodiment, while the saline is injected by the peristaltic pump 72 run in reverse. FIG. 2 also depicts a possible position of the injector 22 and actuator 84 relative to an operating table 102. As shown therein, the injector 22 and actuator may be proximate the table 102, i.e., on an underside 104 thereof. In so doing, the system 100 is made more efficient in that the supply lines of the system 100 can be made shorter, thereby reducing the amount of contrast or other fluid needed in the system. Such placement of the injector and other equipment of the system can be employed with the first embodiment with equal efficacy. With regard to the actual valves used to control fluid flow through the various fluid lines, any number of valve types, including but not limited to check valves, high pressure valves, rotary manifold valves, pinch valves and the like could be employed. In the embodiment of FIGS. 3-7, a pinch valve system is disclosed. FIGS. 3-7 also depict one potential type of user control incorporated within the operator interface 88. Beginning with FIG. 3, it will be noted that each valve is depicted as a pinch valve, meaning the valve includes an anvil 110, and a movable wedge 112 adapted to move toward and away from the anvil 110 as by a pneumatic/hydraulic cylinder, WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 motor, or the like to pinch a flexible tube (forming the fluid line) therebetween and this present fluid flow. It is to be understood that other types of pinch valves, such as those employing multiple movable elements adapted to move toward one another, are possible. For example, in FIG. 3, the contrast valve 96 is depicted in an open position, with the waste valve 92, saline valve 94, and an output valve 116 shown closed. The pressure valve 90, as described herein, is always open except during injection (FIG. 4) to provide the user with a constant pressure reading. With the contrast valve 96 open, the injector 22 can retract, thereby drawing contrast from supply 26, through the valve 96 and into the injector 22. The user can then adjust a control unit 120 of the operator interface 88 to specify injection as shown in FIG. 4, whereupon the contrast valve 96 is closed and the output valve 116 is opened. The injector plunger (not shown) can then advance, thereby pushing contrast from the injector 22 to the catheter 62 and patient. FIGS. 5-7 are much the same, but with the control unit 120 moved to positions corresponding to saline, waste, and pressure, respectively, with the corresponding valve (94, 92, 90) being depicted in an open position when selected with the control unit 120. It is to be understood that the control unit 120 need not be provided by way of the rotary knob depicted but could be any other suitable mechanism enabling a setting to be selected and a corresponding valve signal to be generated. This may include, but not be limited to push buttons and toggle switches, or non-handheld units such as monitor touch screens, and the like. The valve signal generated could be used to actuate a motor (not shown) for moving the wedge 112, energizing a solenoid, pressurizing a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder, releasing a spring, or the like. WO 2004/006994 CA 02487496 2004-11-26 PCT/US2003/021248 Moreover, the signal could be used to manipulate the valve such that vacuum pressure created by the retracting plunger of the injector 22 could cause the desired valve to open. For example, the valves could be provided as normally closed valves wherein the actuation of a solenoid holds the valve open. The control signal could actuate the solenoid so as to release the valve, allowing only a spring or the like to hold the valve closed. The spring could be sized such that the vacuum pressure created by the retracting injector plunger could overcome the spring force and thereby open the valve. Other systems are certainly possible. From the foregoing, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the present disclosure sets forth an apparatus and method for managing fluids injected and otherwise used in a medical procedure.
