Step C: 5-Chloro-2-cyclopropyl-8-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a cooled (−78° C.) solution of 2-cyclopropyl-8-methyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (325 mg, 1.34 mmol) in THF (15 mL) was added n-butyllithium (1.6M/hexanes, 1.01 mL, 1.6 mmol) dropwise via syringe. Stirring was maintained at −78° C. for 30 minutes, and then a solution of hexachloroethane (383 mg, 1.61 mmol) in THF was added dropwise via syringe. After the addition, the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for another 30 minutes. The reaction was quenched with saturated aq. NH4Cl and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a white solid (258 mg, 69%).
