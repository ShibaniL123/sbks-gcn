"A method for producing an aperture plate" INTRODUCTION Field of the Invention The invention relates to manufacture of aperture plates (or "vibrating membranes") for aerosol (or "nebulizer") devices. Prior Art Discussion An aperture plate is used for aerosol delivery of liquid formulations in a controlled liquid droplet size suitable for pulmonary drug delivery. The ideal nebulizer is one which assures a consistent and accurate particle size in combination with an output rate that can be varied to deliver the drug to the targeted area as efficiently as possible. Delivery of the aerosol to the deep lung such as the bronchi and bronchiole regions requires a small and repeatable particle size typically in the range of 2 - 4 μιη. In general, outputs greater than 1 ml/min are required. US6235177, US7066398 and US8398001 describe an approach to manufacturing an aperture plate in which a wafer is built onto a mandrel by a process of electro-deposition where the dissolved metal cations in the plating bath (typically Palladium and Nickel) are reduced using electrical current from the liquid form to the solid form on the wafer. Material is reduced only to the conducting surface on the mandrel and not to photo resist islands which are non-conducting. The aperture hole size and profile are defined by the three dimensional growth of plated materials, thus, electroforming. After the conclusion of the plating process, the mandrel/wafer assembly is removed from the bath and the wafer peeled from the mandrel for subsequent processing into an aperture plate. However, a problem with this approach is that the wafer thickness is intertwined with the placement density of the non-conducting resist islands, i.e. the thicker the wafer, the further the distance between the non-conduction resist islands, and the smaller the aperture density. As a result, it is not possible to increase the aperture density to about 90,000 holes per square inch (approx. 650mm ). Reduced wafer thickness is used to alleviate this issue. If a wafer has a thickness in the range of 50 to 54μιη non-standard drives are required. Also, a reduction in the aperture plate thickness alters the harmonics and natural frequency of the core assembly. To drive this optimally to generate an acceptable flow rate output, it is necessary to alter the drive frequency. This is disadvantageous as it requires the development, manufacture, and supply of a matching drive controller which has consequential cost and lead time implications. Photo-defined technology as described in WO2012/092163 A and WO2013/186031A allows a large number of holes to be produced per unit area because it applies standard wafer processing technology to define the aperture plate hole size and profile through photolithography, thus, "photo-defined". This technology may involve plating multiple layers to achieve desired aperture plate geometry and profile, for example, a first layer normally called the outlet or droplet size defining layer, and subsequently imparting a second layer on top of this which is normally called the inlet or reservoir layer. It can be challenging to achieve the correct levels of interfacial adhesion between both layers. And the process is more complex than that for electroforming. US2006/0203036 describes an approach to fabricating an orifice plate in which there is plating on rings, so that plated material within the rings forms apertures which narrow to a minimum at about half their depth. The invention is directed towards providing an improved method to address the above problems.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Brief Description of the Drawings The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of some embodiments thereof, given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which :- Figs. 1 to 4 are a series of cross-sectional views showing stages of manufacturing an aperture plate; Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view of a stage in an alternative embodiment; Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional diagram illustrating an alternative approach in which there are tapered openings below the aerosol-forming apertures; and Fig. 7 shows an aperture plate of the type n Fig. 6 after it has been formed into a dome shape. Description of the Embodiments Referring to Figs. 1 to 4, the following are the main steps to manufacture an aperture plate in one embodiment. An aperture plate is manufactured by plating metal around a mask of resist columns 2 having a height of about 45μιη, a diameter of about 30 μιη and a separation of about 30 μιη,. The plating is continued so that the metal 3 overlies the top surfaces of the columns until the desired apertures 4 are achieved. This provides the benefits of both photo-defined technology (by reducing the aspect ratio near the aperture region during electroforming) and aperture density by enabling more closely patterned resist islands, with need for only one masking/plating cycle to achieve the desired plate thickness. In more detail, non-conductive photo-resist 2 is laid on to a mandrel 1 substrate. This is developed to leave the upstanding columns 2 where holes are required. The tops of the columns 2 are approximately convex. The mandrel is placed in an electroforming tank. As the plating continues, the space between the columns 2 of developed photo resist is in-filled with the plating material. This is typically a PdNi alloy matrix, or it could alternatively be Nickel or a Nickel Cobalt alloy matrix. The plating is initially to the extent shown in Fig. 2 and is continued so that over-plating occurs as shown in Fig. 3. This plating is stopped just in time to create 2 to 6 μιη holes 4 as shown also in Fig. 3. The diametrical size accuracy of these holes can be improved by slowing down the plating deposition activity as the holes are being formed. This prevents 'overshoot' resulting in smaller or occluded holes with the possibility of a thicker than desired wafer construction. The 45 μιη column height is so chosen such that when the plating is stopped (Fig. 3) the holes are typically 2 to 6 μιη and preferably 2 to 5 μιη, which is required to produce droplets in the inhalable range for nebulisation, and concurrently the wafer thickness is in the range of 60 to 62 μιη in one embodiment. The convex shape of the entry surfaces to the apertures in addition to the concave shape of the overall domed shaped aperture plate (Fig. 7) provides effective funnelling of the liquid towards the aerosol-forming apertures 4, thereby minimising the residual volume of the drug in the nebuliser. When the photo-resist 2 is removed using an appropriate dissolving solvent, the full wafer cross-section is evident as depicted in Fig. 4. The cross-sectional profile under the hole 4 forms passageways directly under and aligned with the apertures. Because they are formed by removal of the column resist they have the same length as the heights of the columns 2. In use, these passageways under the apertures encourage entrainment of the aerosol towards the outlet of the nebuliser, thereby reducing coalescence with the resultant undesirable effect of larger droplets being formed. In an alternative embodiment (Fig. 5), photo-resist columns 11 have flat top surfaces over which the metal (12) is plated. As evident from Fig. 6, in a plate 20 the remaining metal may form outlet hole or passageway 24 sides that are tapered towards the aerosol outlet direction. This drawing shows the wafer metal 21 forming aerosol-forming apertures 22. The liquid 23 is aerosolized through the apertures 22 to exit as droplets through the entrainment openings or passageways 24 aligned with and below the apertures 22. Clearly, choice of geometry of the resist columns decides the geometry of the passageways. Fig. 7 shows an aperture plate 30 with metal 31 forming apertures 32 and droplet entrainment openings 34, after being formed into a dome shape. As noted above, this dome shape together with the convex shape of the metal between the apertures 32 helps to effectively funnel the liquid 33 towards the apertures 32 in order to form droplets, which exit via the entrainment openings 34. These much larger holes 34 in comparison (to the aperture diameter) can entrain the aerosol, almost into a laminar flow pattern. This reduces turbulence and consequential coalescence which can lead to an undesirable increase in droplet size. These openings may be tapered (Figs. 6 and 7) or not (Figs 1-4). The resultant wafer 10 has a greater number of holes, greater than 44,100 per 650mm (square inch, Mesh 210), than the prior art and yet maintains the same aperture plate thickness (approximately 61μιη) as many commercially available products. This ensures that the existing drive controllers (128 kHz) already in situ in many hospitals can be used for the aperture plate, alleviating the cost and considerable time required to be expended to develop a bespoke drive controller to ensure that the correct frequency is available to achieve optimum aerosol output. It is also more conducive for meeting and exceeding the fatigue life requirements. As there is single-layer plating it incorporates a fine equiaxed micro structure. It will be appreciated that the method provides the benefits of both photo-defined technology, partially decoupling the dependence of wafer thickness to resist island patterning distance and increased aperture density, with the process simplicity of electroforming, because it needs only one masking/plating cycle to achieve the desired plate thickness. Those skilled in the electro-deposition field will appreciate how the plating conditions may be chosen to suit the circumstances, and the entire contents of the following documents are herein incorporated by reference: US4628165, US6235117, US2007023547, US2001013554, WO2009/042187, and Lu S. Y., Li J. F., Zhou Y. H., "Grain refinement in the solidification of undercooled Ni-Pd alloys", Journal of Crystal Growth 309 (2007) 103-111, Sept 14 2007. Generally, most electroplating solutions involving Palladium and Nickel would work or Nickel only or indeed Phosphorous & Nickel (14:86) or Platinum. It is possible that a non-Palladium wafer could be plated at the surface (1 - 3 microns thick) in PdNi to impart more corrosion resistance. This would also reduce the hole sizes if smaller openings were desired. The resist geometry, such as height, width, and shape, is configured in such a way as to increase the number of holes while maintaining the desired wafer thickness. Further increase of hole density is also possible. For example, the invention in one embodiment achieves an aperture plate of about 4 times the density (moving from 210 to 420 holes per 25 mm (linear inch) or from 44,100 to 176,400 holes per 650 mm (square inch), while still maintaining the typical 60 to 62 μιη thickness range. Adjusting the dimensions in Fig. 1, by reducing the column 2 diameter (30 μιη) and dimensions between the columns 2 to say 15 μιη has the potential to increase the number of holes to 700 to 850 per 25 mm (linear inch). The invention avoids need for two-layer photo defined technology to increase the number of holes while maintaining the same wafer thickness. It also solves the problem of using standard plating defined technology as referred to in the Prior Art Discussion with a greater number of holes which will result in a lower thickness wafer, thus requiring significant changes to the core construction, or more typically the drive controller, to find the optimum drive frequency. The invention finds particular application where faster nebulisation treatment times are required. This is usually required for hand-held devices when aerosol is administrated through the mouth or nasal passages in fully mobile patients. These are typically patients who administer nebulised drugs in a non-hospital setting. This is in contrast to intubated hospital patients who are typically on mechanical ventilation where treatment times are less important as long as the patient gets the full prescribed dose. Techniques for vibrating the aperture plates are described generally in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,164,740; 5,586,550; and 5,758,637, which are incorporated herein by reference. The aperture plates are constructed to permit the production of relatively small liquid droplets at a relatively fast rate. For example, the aperture plates of the invention may be employed to produce liquid droplets having a size in the range from about 2 μιη to about 10 μιη , and more typically between about 2 μιη to about 5 μιη. In some cases, the aperture plates may be employed to produce a spray that is useful in pulmonary drug delivery procedures. As such, the sprays produced by the aperture plates may have a respirable fraction that is greater than about 70%, preferably more than about 80%, and most preferably more than about 90% as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,758,637. In some embodiments, such fine liquid droplets may be produced at a rate in the range from about 2 μΐ (microliters) per second to about 25 μΐ per second per 1000 apertures. In this way, aperture plates may be constructed to have multiple apertures that are sufficient to produce aerosolized volumes that are in the range from about 2 μΐ to about 25 μΐ, within a time that is less than about one second. Such a rate of production is particularly useful for pulmonary drug delivery applications where a desired dosage is aerosolized at a rate sufficient to permit the aerosolised medicament to be directly inhaled. In this way, a capture chamber is not needed to capture the liquid droplets until the specified dosage has been produced. In this manner, the aperture plates may be included within aerosolisers, nebulizers, or inhalers that do not utilise elaborate capture chambers. The aperture plate may be employed to deliver a wide variety of drugs to the respiratory system. For example, the aperture plate may be utilized to deliver drugs having potent therapeutic agents, such as hormones, peptides, and other drugs requiring precise dosing including drugs for local treatment of the respiratory system. Examples of liquid drugs that may be aerosolized include drugs in solution form, e.g., aqueous solutions, ethanol solutions, aqueous/ethanol mixture solutions, and the like, in colloidal suspension form, and the like. The invention may also find use in aerosolizing a variety of other types of liquids, such as insulin. It will be appreciated that the invention allows the production of a wafer from which nebuliser aperture plates are punched in one single plating step and facilitates the creation of a larger number of holes than that known today (typically up to 400%). Also, it facilitates the use of aperture plates which are 60 to 62 μιη thick. Also, it allows an increase in the number of holes per unit of area while still being able to control the plating thickness to a predetermined dimension. The above in combination allows the creation of a higher output nebuliser while still maintaining the standard drive controller and core construction all of which is accomplished in a very economical manner.
