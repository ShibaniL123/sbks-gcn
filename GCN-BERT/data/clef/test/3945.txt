This may change the flavor, intensity, texture, and/or taste of the brewed lemonade according to the needs of the operator or the preferences of those who will drink the brewed lemonade. The resulting product is a still beverage that fully evacuates from the brew basket or filter but does not melt through the brew basket or filter too quickly, thereby creating a homogeneous mixture once brewed. [0017] It should be appreciated that the pre-prepared lemonade mixture, regardless what form it may take, may be comprised of lemons and water, thereby making it a fresh-brewed lemonade as opposed to a powder or other artificial mixtures that may be presently available to prepare lemonade in commercial settings. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the pre- prepared lemonade mixture also may include flavorings, pulp, and/or pureed fruit to enhance the taste and flavor of the resultant brewed lemonade. In embodiments of the present disclosure, the pre-prepared lemonade mixture also may include gum-based additions that may make the resultant brewed lemonade more palatable and also may cause the pre-prepared lemonade mixture to melt faster when hot water flows through the brew basket during the brewing process or when water combines with the pre-prepared lemonade mixture in the dispenser. It should be appreciated that the tartness and/or sweetness levels of the resultant brewed lemonade may be adjusted depending on the preferences of the consuming public, such as within a particular geographical region. For example, the consuming public in the Southern United States generally may prefer sweeter brewed lemonade than the consuming public in the Northeast United States. Accordingly, the type or amount of sweetener may be selectively adjusted to accommodate the tastes and preferences of those likely to consume the brewed lemonade without departing from the present disclosure. [0018] It should be appreciated that different types of brewing machines may be utilized without departing from the present disclosure. A brewing machine, including but not limited to a Bunn Infusion Iced Tea Brewer (ITB or ITCB), may be utilized. The brewing machine may be a machine that may ordinarily have brewed coffee or tea but may be adapted to brew a still beverage, such as lemonade, in some embodiments of the present disclosure. In other embodiments of the present disclosure, the brewing machine may be specially configured to brew still beverages, such as lemonade. In further or other embodiments of the present disclosure, a specially configured brew basket may be employed. [0019] FIGURE 1 depicts a brewing machine with a dispenser to receive the still beverage, such as lemonade, as it is brewed according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As depicted in FIGURE 1, the brewing machine may include a brew basket or filter that may ordinarily receive a tea or coffee bag or filter pack. It should be appreciated that the same brew basket or filter may be used in brewing a still beverage according to embodiments of the present disclosure; however, there may be embodiments of the present disclosure wherein the brew basket or filter may be modified to receive certain types of pre-prepared still beverage mixtures without departing from the present disclosure. The brew basket may include a funnel on the bottom that may allow the brewed still beverage to flow through to a serving device, such as a dispenser or reservoir. The serving device may receive the pre-prepared still beverage mixture once it has flowed through the brew basket or filter. [0020] In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the brew machine may include an empty brew basket having a funnel (such as one of the brew baskets depicted in FIGURE 4) inserted into funnel rails positioned over a reservoir or dispenser into which the brewed lemonade will flow from the brew basket. The operator may place a pre-prepared still beverage mixture into the brew basket or filter. The funnel of the brew basket should be positioned to align the funnel discharge over the dispenser or reservoir. The operator may then select a batch size and other optional settings and then start the brewing process.
