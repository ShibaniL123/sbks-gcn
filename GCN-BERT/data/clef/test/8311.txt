Example 3. (R)-N-(1-butylpyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine
80.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 0.0420 mL of 1-bromobutane was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0960 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine. After 20 droplets of N,N-dimethylformamide was added thereto, the resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 5 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 90.0 mg of (R)-N-(1-butylpyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 83.3%.
