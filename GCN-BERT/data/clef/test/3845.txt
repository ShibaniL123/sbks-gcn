CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This non-provisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) on Patent Application No. 2012-235818 filed in Japan on Oct. 25, 2012, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]silane compound and a method for preparing the same by reacting 2-norbornene with a hydrosilane compound in the presence of a catalyst composed of a phosphine-free palladium compound and a phosphite compound. BACKGROUND ART Silane compounds having a norbornyl radical are useful as reactants for various silicone compounds (for use in paint, adhesives, and high refractive index materials), coupling agents, coating composition ingredients, and organic synthesis intermediates. While norbornyl-containing compounds are known to have a high refractive index and thus used in high refractive index materials, they are still insufficient in refractive index. While a compound having a higher refractive index is desired, there is a need for a silane compound having a linkage of two norbornyl radicals. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a method for preparing a vinyl-containing [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]silane compound by reacting 5-vinyl-2-norbornene with a hydrosilane compound in the presence of metallic palladium or a palladium complex containing no phosphorus compound as a ligand. It is known from Non-Patent Document 1 that a silane compound having a linkage of two unsubstituted norbornyl radicals, typically [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]trichlorosilane is formed as a by-product in hydrosilylation reaction between 2-norbornene and trichlorosilane in the presence of an isopropanol solution of chloroplatinic acid as a catalyst. However, the vinyl-containing [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]silane compound is not suitable as a reactant for forming coatings on electronic parts. When the compound is subjected to hydrolysis and formulated in a silicone coating composition, the composition can be colored with time due to oxidation of vinyl in the molecule. While a silicone oil as a high refractive index material ingredient is formed by co-hydrolysis of a silane compound having a linkage of two norbornyl radicals, for example, [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]trichlorosilane and another silane compound, the amount of the trichlorosilane (which is trifunctional) added must be limited in order that the resulting compound remain oily. There is thus a need for a difunctional silane compound having a linkage of two norbornyl radicals, for example, [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]organodichlorosilane which can be added in a higher proportion without depriving the product of oiliness. Also, for use as coupling agent after hydrolysis, a silane compound having a linkage of two norbornyl radicals, for example, [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]organoxysilane is desirable because no corrosive hydrogen chloride is formed as by-product. Accordingly, it is desirable to have a difunctional silane compound having a linkage of two norbornyl radicals and free of an aliphatic unsaturated radical such as vinyl or an organoxysilane compound having a [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl] radical. It is also desirable to have a method for preparing [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]trichlorosilane in high yields. CITATION LIST Patent Document 1: JP-A H01-132591 Non-patent Document 1: A. D.

X is a halogen atom or an organoxy radical OR2. Exemplary halogens include chlorine, fluorine and iodine. Of these, chlorine is preferred because a hydrosilane compound as the starting reactant is readily available. The substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 10 carbon atoms represented by R2 is as exemplified above for R1. Examples of the [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]silane compound having formula (1) include [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]methyldichlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]dimethylchlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]ethyldichlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]diethylchlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]propyldichlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]dipropylchlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]trimethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]triethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]methyldimethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]methyldiethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]ethyldimethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]ethyldiethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]propyldimethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]propyldiethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]dimethylmethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]dimethylethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]diethylmethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]diethylethoxysilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]dipropylmethoxysilane, and[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]dipropylethoxysilane. According to the method of the invention, a [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]halosilane compound having the general formula (3) is prepared by reacting a hydrosilane compound having the general formula (2) with 2-norbornene in the presence of a catalyst composed of a phosphine-free palladium compound and a phosphite compound added thereto. Herein R1 is defined as above, X′ is a halogen atom, and m is 0, 1 or 2. Exemplary groups of R1 in formula (2) are the same as exemplified above in conjunction with formula (1). Examples of the hydrosilane compound having formula (2) include trichlorosilane, methyldichlorosilane, ethyldichlorosilane, propyldichiorosilane, dimethylchlorosilane, diethylchlorosilane, and dipropylchlorosilane. Examples of the [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]halosilane compound having formula (3) include [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]trichlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]methyldichlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]dimethylchlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]ethyldichlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]diethylchlorosilane,[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]propyldichlorosilane, and[3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]dipropylchlorosilane. In the reaction of 2-norbornene with a hydrosilane compound, they may be combined in any desired ratio. It is preferred from the aspects of reactivity and productivity that 0.2 to 1.0 mole, more preferably 0.25 to 0.7 mole and even more preferably 0.4 to 0.6 mole of hydrosilane compound be used per mole of 2-norbornene. Examples of the phosphine-free palladium compound include palladium chloride, dichloro(1,5-cyclooctadiene)-palladium, and palladium acetate. Of these, palladium acetate is preferred from the aspects of reactivity and catalyst stability. The amount of the phosphine-free palladium compound used is not particularly limited. From the aspects of reactivity and productivity, it is preferably 0.000001 to 0.01 mole, more preferably 0.000005 to 0.005 mole, and even more preferably 0.00001 to 0.001 mole per mole of 2-norbornene. Less than 0.000001 mole of the phosphine-free palladium compound may fail to exert a sufficient catalytic effect. If the amount of the phosphine-free palladium compound exceeds 0.01 mole, a reaction promoting effect commensurate with that catalyst amount may not be obtained. The phosphite compound preferably has the general formula (4): [in-line-formulae]P(OR3)(OR4)(OR5) (4)[/in-line-formulae] wherein R3, R4 and R5 are each independently a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 10 carbon atoms. In formula (4), R3, R4 and R5 are each independently selected from substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon radicals, which include straight, branched or cyclic aliphatic monovalent hydrocarbon radicals such as straight, branched or cyclic alkyl, aryl, and aralkyl radicals. Examples include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, phenyl, benzyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, 2-ethylhexyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. Examples of the phosphite compound having formula (4) include trimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, tripropyl phosphite, tributyl phosphite, triisobutyl phosphite, tripentyl phosphite, trihexyl phosphite, tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphite, triisopropyl phosphite, tri-sec-butyl phosphite, tri-tert-butyl phosphite, tricyclopentyl phosphite, tricyclohexyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite, tribenzyl phosphite, and tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphite. Although the amount of the phosphite compound used is not particularly limited, it is preferred for reactivity and selectivity that the phosphite compound be used in an amount of 1.0 to 10.0 moles, more preferably 1.5 to 8.0 moles, and even more preferably 3.0 to 6.0 moles per mole of palladium in the phosphine-free palladium compound. If the amount of the phosphite compound used is less than 1.0 mole, the selectivity of reaction may be reduced or the reaction may not take place. If the amount of the phosphite compound used exceeds 10.0 moles, the reactivity may be reduced. Although the reaction may take place in a solventless system, a solvent may be used. Examples of the solvent used include hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, octane, isooctane, benzene, toluene, xylene and mesitylene, ether solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, aprotic polar solvents such as acetonitrile, and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform. These solvents may be used alone or in admixture of two or more. Since 2-norbornene is a compound having a melting point of 44-46° C. which is solid at room temperature, it may be used as a solution in the foregoing solvent for ease of handling. The relevant reaction may be performed by adding the hydrosilane compound having formula (2) to 2-norbornene and a catalyst which is obtained by adding a phosphite compound to a phosphine-free palladium compound. Alternatively, 2-norbornene may be added to the hydrosilane compound having formula (2) and a catalyst which is obtained by adding a phosphite compound to a phosphine-free palladium'compound. In the case of post-addition of 2-norbornene, it is preferably dissolved in a solvent prior to its addition. Although reaction of 2-norbornene with the hydrosilane compound having formula (2) may be initiated immediately after a phosphine-free palladium compound and a phosphite compound having formula (4) are added to 2-norbornene or the hydrosilane to form a mixture, it is desired that the mixture be stirred for 1 to 10 hours, preferably 2 to 4 hours at elevated temperature prior to the reaction. Specifically, the preferred reaction procedure involves adding the phosphine-free palladium compound and the phosphite compound to a solution of 2-norbornene in toluene or the like, stirring the mixture at 80 to 90° C. for 1 to 10 hours, more preferably 2 to 4 hours, thereafter adding the hydrosilane compound having formula (2) to the mixture, and allowing reaction to run. Stirring of the mixture at elevated temperature prior to addition of the hydrosilane compound is effective for improving the production ratio of the desired [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]halosilane having formula (3), as determined from peak areas of gas chromatography. The reaction temperature is typically in a range of 0° C. to 200° C., preferably 10° C. to 120° C. under atmospheric or applied pressure, though not limited thereto. The reaction time is typically 1 to 100 hours, preferably 2 to 20 hours. Although the reaction atmosphere is not particularly limited, an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or helium is preferred for safety. Also the compound having formula (1) in which X is an organoxy radical OR2 can be prepared by reacting a corresponding [3-(2-norbornyl)-2-norbornyl]halosilane compound having formula (3) with an alcohol having the formula: R2OH wherein R2 is as defined above. Examples of the alcohol: R2OH wherein R2 is as defined above include methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, and n-butanol. The alcohol is preferably used in an amount of 0.8 to 2.0 moles, more preferably 1.0 to 1.3 moles per mole of halogen. The reaction with alcohol may be performed while removing hydrogen halide by-product from the reaction system. If the reaction is performed in the presence of a base, the reaction product of hydrogen halide by-product with the base may be removed. In the former reaction mode with removal of hydrogen halide, there is a possibility that hydrogen halide can react, before removal, with unreacted alcohol to form by-products, an alkyl halide and water, and the resulting water can react with a halosilane or a produced alkoxysilane from the halosilane to form a siloxane by-product, leading to low yields. For this reason, the latter reaction mode using a base is preferred. Examples of the base used herein include triethylamine, tributylamine, trioctylamine, and pyridine. The base is preferably used in an amount of 0.8 to 2.0 moles, more preferably 1.0 to 1.3 moles per mole of halogen. In the reaction mode using the base, since the base forms a hydrochloride salt as by-product, the reaction is preferably performed in a solvent. Examples of the solvent used herein include hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, octane, isooctane, benzene, toluene, xylene, and mesitylene. The reaction temperature is preferably in a range of 0° C. to 150° C., more preferably 10° C. to 100° C. under atmospheric or applied pressure, though not limited thereto. The reaction time is typically 0.5 to 100 hours, preferably 1 to 20 hours. Although the reaction atmosphere is not particularly limited, an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or helium is preferred for safety. The reaction is preferably carried out by adding the alcohol to a mixture of the compound of formula (3), the solvent and the base.
