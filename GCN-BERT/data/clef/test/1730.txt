Example 2: synthesis of sodium and 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate [(2S, 5S)-4-(2-ammoniumethoxyimino)-2-carbamoyl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl] sulfate
Step 1: preparation of intermediate 4-tert-butyl ester 3-methyl ester (1 R,4S,6S)-7-oxa-3-aza-bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane-3,4-dicarboxylate (2a)
To a solution of 1-tert-butyl ester 2-methyl ester (2S,4S,5S)-4-hydroxy-5-iodo-piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (prepared according to the procedure described in J.Org.Chem., 2008, 73, 8661-8664) (8.82 g, 22.90 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (100 mL) under inert atmosphere was added a MeONa solution 0.5M in MeOH (45.81 mL, 22.90 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred 20 h at rt, then the solution was washed with NaOH 1 N. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated in vacuo. The crude residue was solubilized in mixture of EtOAc/cyclohexane (50/50) and filtered on silica gel cake to provide 4-tert-butyl ester 3-methyl ester (1R,4S,6S)-7-oxa-3-aza-bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane-3,4-dicarboxylate (2a) (5.33 g, 20.71 mmol, 90%) as a yellow oil.
