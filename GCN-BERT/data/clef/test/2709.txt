(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-7-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acr ylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-7-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl) -6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 16f (300 mg, 0.664 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of dichloromethane, then 2,6-lutidine (142 mg, 1.329 mmol) and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (281 mg, 0.996 mmol) were added at 0°C. The reaction was stirred for 2 hours at 0°C. After the reaction was stopped, the reaction solution was warmed up to room temperature. Water was added, and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-7-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(((tri fluoromethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 16g (300 mg, yield 77%) as a yellow oil.
