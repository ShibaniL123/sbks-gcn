REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/533,285, filed on Sep. 12, 2011, and incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) are produced via dynamic vulcanization of non-miscible blends of a rubber and a thermoplastic, that is, the selective cross-linking of the rubber, while melt mixing with the thermoplastic. As a result, products are obtained which consist of cross-linked rubber particles dispersed in a thermoplastic matrix, which provides both the elasticity and melt processability of TPVs. Compare to their non-crosslinked TPE counterparts, TPVs have superior properties in terms of heat resistance, compression set, chemical resistance and tensile strength. The majority of commercial TPVs are based on blends of EPDM with polypropylene (PP), which are typically crosslinked using a phenol derivative. Thermoplastic vulcanizates may advantageously be produced by employing a peroxide cure system. “Peroxide-cured EPDM/PP TPV” generally exhibit lower color and lower residues than phenolic-cured TPV products, while maintaining good thermal stability and good compression set. U.S. Pat. No. 3,806,558 discloses that ethylene propylene-diene terpolymers (EPDM) can be partially cured by dynamic vulcanization, in the presence of polypropylene, to provide reprocessable materials with good physical properties. The diene component in polymer chains improves the crosslinking efficiency, but results in poor environmental degradation resistance. Alternatively, an ethylene-alpha olefin copolymer without a diene group can be used as rubber phase in peroxide cured TPV. Reference JP 3359505 discloses a thermoplastic polymer composition with improved environmental degradation by using an ethylene-octene copolymer produced by metallocene catalyst. However, metallocene-catalyzed ethylene-octene copolymer has a significant level of unsaturated groups that are not optimized for crosslinking applications. It would be desirable for many of these applications to have new TPV formulations that have improved compression set and other mechanical properties. International Publication No. WO 2011/002998 discloses ethylenic polymers comprising low levels of total unsaturation. Compositions using such ethylene polymers and fabricated articles made from the same are also disclosed. International Publication No. WO 2011/002986 discloses ethylene polymers having low levels of long chain branching. Films and film layers, made from these polymers, and having good hot tack strength over a wide range of temperatures, are also disclosed. International Publication No. WO 2007/136497 discloses a catalyst composition comprising one or more metal complexes of a multifunctional Lewis base ligand, comprising a bulky, planar, aromatic- or substituted aromatic-group; and polymerization processes employing the same, especially continuous, solution polymerization of one or more α-olefins at high catalyst efficiencies. See also WO 2007/136496 and WO 2007/136494. U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,236 discloses substantially linear olefin polymers having a melt flow ratio (I10/I2)≧5.63, a molecular weight distribution defined by the equation: Mw/Mn≦(I10/I2)−4.63, and a critical shear stress at onset of gross melt fracture of greater than about 4×106 dyne/cm2, and their method of manufacture. The substantially linear olefin polymers preferably have at least about “0.01 long chain branches/1000 carbons” and a molecular weight distribution from about 1.5 to about 2.5. The polymers have improved processability, and are useful in producing fabricated articles, such as fibers, films, and molded parts. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,278,272. JP3359505B2 discloses a thermoplastic polymer composition for resistance to environmental deterioration. The thermoplastic polymer composition comprises (A) 100 parts weight of an olefinic polymer, comprising ethylene and at least one kind of C3-C10 α-olefin (density of 0.85-0.91 g/cm3 and Mw/Mn of <3.0), (B) 5-100 parts weight of a propylene polymer, (C) 5-250 parts weight of an oil, (D) 0.02-3 parts weight of a radical polymerization initiator, and (E) 0.1-5 parts weight of at least one crosslinking auxiliary, selected from divinyl benzene and triallyl isocyanurate. The composition can be obtained by heating and kneading the components, except the component C, to partially crosslink the mixture, and then subsequently adding the component C. EP 0751182A1 discloses an olefin thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising 10 parts to less than 60 parts, by weight, of a crystalline polyolefin resin (A), and 90 parts to more than 40 parts, by weight, of an ethylene/α-olefin/nonconjugated polyene rubber (B). The rubber (B) is obtained by random copolymerization of ethylene, a C3-C20 α-olefin, and a nonconjugated polyene, in the presence of a metallocene catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,600 discloses rheology-modified thermoplastic elastomer compositions, comprising a melt blend of an ethylene/α-olefin polymer and a high melting polymer, such as polypropylene or a propylene/α-olefin copolymer. The rheology modification is induced by a combination of a peroxide and a free radical coagent. The resulting composition has an elastomeric phase, a non-elastomeric phase, and certain physical properties that exceed those of a like composition that is rheology-modified by peroxide alone. The compositions can be used to make a variety of articles of manufacture, such as automotive instrument panel skins, via calendaring and thermoforming procedures.

Nos. 6,121,383, 6,147,160, 6,277,916, 6,476,132, 6,774,186, 4,130,535, 5,672,660, 4,948,840, 7,906,586, 7,338,994; US Publication Nos. 2002/0151647, 2007/0021564, 2007/0037931, 2006/0199910, 2002/0151647, 2007/0167575; and EP1940945B1. There remains a need for TPV compositions with improved compression set and mechanical properties. There is also a need for such compositions that have reduced rubber particle size (and thus higher surface area and interface volume fraction) and increase the interfacial adhesion between the rubber phase and the plastic phase (all as indicated by improved mechanical properties). Compatibility and diffusion parameter of the rubber and thermoplastic affect interface thickness and interpolymer entanglements, and thus determine the size of the dispersed phase particle size and the mechanical and elastic properties. These needs and others have been met by the following invention.

Applications The present invention also provides a process of making TPV composition comprising blending component B and cured component A by dynamic vulcanization. The thermoplastic vulcanizates based on the invented composition are preferably prepared by utilizing dynamic vulcanization techniques. Dynamic vulcanization is a process whereby a blend of plastic, rubber and rubber curative is masticated, while curing the rubber. The term “dynamic” indicates the mixture is subjected to shear forces during the vulcanization step, as contrasted with “static” vulcanization, wherein the vulcanizable composition is immobile (in fixed relative space) during the vulcanization step. One advantage of dynamic vulcanization is that elastoplastic (thermoplastic elastomeric) compositions may be obtained when the crosslinked rubber is well dispersed in the thermoplastic matrix. Examples of dynamic vulcanization are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,037,954; 3,806,558; 4,104,210; 4,116,914; 4,130,535; 4,141,863; 4,141,878; 4,173,556; 4,207,404; 4,271,049 4,287,324; 4,288,570; 4,299,931; 4,311,628 and 4,338,413; each reference is incorporated herein by reference.

When an extruder is used to prepare the TPV, if additional oil is needed, the oil is preferably added from a port provided in the melt mixing device using a gear pump or the like. Moreover, additional additives or materials, including other resins and elastomers, may be added by a side feeder on the melt mixing device or the like. In one embodiment, the composition further comprises at least one additive.

Test Methods Density Density is measured in accordance with ASTM D-792-08. Melt Index Melt index (I2) for the ethylene-based polymers, in g/10 min, was measured using ASTM D-1238-10 (Condition 190° C./2.16 kg). The notation “I5” refers to a melt index, in g/10 min, measured using ASTM D-1238-10, Condition 190° C./5.0 kg.

For propylene-based polymers, the melt flow rate (MFR) was measured using ASTM D-1238-10 (Condition 230° C./2.16 kg). NMR Experimental Sample Preparation For 13C NMR, the sample was prepared by adding approximately “2.7 g of stock solvent” to “0.21 g sample,” in a 10 mm NMR tube, and then purging the resulting solution in a nitrogen (N2) box for two hours. The stock solvent was made by dissolving “4 g of PDCB-d4” in “39.2 g of ODCB with 0.025M chromium acetylacetonate (relaxation agent).” The sample was dissolved, and homogenized, by heating the tube and its contents at 140-150° C. For 1H NMR, the samples were prepared by adding “˜130 mg of sample” to “3.25 g of 50/50 by weight Tetrachlorethane-d2/Perchloroethylene with 0.001 M Cr(AcAc)3” in a NORELL 1001-7, 10 mm NMR tube. The samples were purged by bubbling nitrogen (N2) through the solvent, via a pipette inserted into the tube, for approximately five minutes, to prevent oxidation. The samples were then capped, sealed with TEFLON tape, and then soaked at room temperature, overnight, to facilitate sample dissolution. The samples were kept in a N2 purge box during storage, before, and after preparation, to minimize exposure to oxygen. The samples were heated and vortexed at 115° C. to ensure homogeneity. Data Acquisition Parameters For 13C NMR, the data were collected using a BRUKER 400 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a BRUKER Dual DUL high-temperature CryoProbe. The data were acquired using “320 transients per data file,” a “7.3 sec pulse repetition delay (6 sec delay+1.3 sec acq. time),” “90 degree flip angles,” and inverse gated decoupling with a sample temperature of 120° C. All measurements were made on non spinning samples in locked mode. Samples were homogenized immediately prior to insertion into the heated (125° C.) NMR sample changer, and were allowed to thermally equilibrate in the probe for seven minutes, prior to data acquisition. The 1H NMR was performed on a BRUKER AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer, equipped with a BRUKER Dual DUL high-temperature CryoProbe, and a sample temperature of 120° C. Two experiments were run to obtain spectra, a control spectrum to quantify the total polymer protons, and a double presaturation experiment, to suppress the intense polymer backbone peaks, and to enable high sensitivity spectra for quantitation of the end-groups. The control was run with ZG pulse, 4 scans, SWH 10,000 Hz, AQ 1.64 s, D1 14 s. The double presaturation experiment was run with a modified pulse sequence, lc1prf2.zz1, TD 32768, 100 scans, DS 4, SWH 10,000 Hz, AQ 1.64 s, D1 1 s, D13 13 s. Gel Content Gel content can be measured by a small scale Soxhlet extraction method. Samples are cut into small pieces, ranging from about 35 mg to 86 mg. Three pieces of each sample are individually weighed, to at least four digits, on a top-loading electronic analytical balance. Each piece is placed inside a small cylinder composed of aluminum window screen. The ends of the cylinders are closed with ordinary paper staples. Six aluminum cylinders are placed inside one fritted glass extraction thimble. The thimbles are placed in jacketed Soxhlet extractors, and extracted overnight with refluxing xylenes. At the end of the minimum 12 hour extraction, the still warm thimbles are quenched in methanol. The methanol precipitates the gel, to facilitate removal of the gels, intact from the cylinders. The cylinders containing precipitated gels are purged briefly with nitrogen to drive off free methanol. The gels are removed from the aluminum cylinders with forceps, and placed on aluminum weighing pans. The pans with gels are vacuum dried for one hour at 125° C. The dried, cool gels are removed from aluminum weighing pans, and weighed directly on the top-loading analytical balance. The dry extracted gel weight is divided by the starting weight to give the percent gel content. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) Conventional GPC measurements were used to determine the weight-average (Mw) and number-average (Mn) molecular weight of the polymer, and to determine the MWD(=Mw/Mn). Samples were analyzed with a high-temperature GPC instrument (Polymer Laboratories, Inc. model PL220). The method employs the well-known universal calibration method, based on the concept of hydrodynamic volume, and the calibration was performed using narrow polystyrene (PS) standards along with four mixed A, 20 μm columns (PLgel Mixed A from Agilent (formerly Polymer Laboratory Inc.)), operating at a system temperature of 140° C. Samples were prepared at a “2 mg/mL” concentration, in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene solvent. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and the injection size was 100 microliters. The molecular weight determination was deduced by using narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards (from Polymer Laboratories), in conjunction with their elution volumes. The equivalent polyethylene molecular weights were determined by using appropriate Mark-Houwink coefficients for polyethylene and polystyrene (as described by Williams and Ward in Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Letters, Vol. 6, (621) 1968) to derive the following equation: [in-line-formulae]Mpolyethylene=a*(Mpolystyrene)b.[/in-line-formulae] In this equation, a=0.4316 and b=1.0. Weight average molecular weight (Mw) and number average molecular weight (Mn) were calculated in the usual manners. For example, Mw was calculated according to the following formula: Mw=Σ wi Mi, where wi and Mi are the weight fraction and molecular weight, respectively, of the ith fraction eluting from the GPC column Polyethylene equivalent molecular weight calculations were performed using Viscotek TriSEC software Version 3.0. Differential Scanning Calorimetry Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) can be used to measure melting temperature, crystallization temperature, and crystallinity of ethylene-based polymer (PE) samples and propylene-based polymer (PP) samples. About five to eight mg of sample is weighed and placed in a DSC pan. The lid is crimped on the pan to ensure a closed atmosphere. The sample pan is placed in a DSC cell, and then heated, at a rate of approximately 10° C./min, to a temperature of 180° C. for PE (230° C. for PP). The sample is kept at this temperature for three minutes. Then the sample is cooled, at a rate of 10° C./min, to −60° C. for PE (−40° C. for PP), and kept isothermally at that temperature for three minutes. The sample is next heated at a rate of 10° C./min, until complete melting (second heat). The percent crystallinity is calculated by dividing the heat of fusion (Hf), determined from the second heat curve, by a theoretical heat of fusion of 292 J/g for PE (165 J/g, for PP), and multiplying this quantity by 100 (for example, % cryst.=(Hf/292 J/g)×100 (for PE)). Unless otherwise stated, melting point(s) (Tm) of each polymer sample is determined from the second heat curve, obtained from DSC, as described above. The crystallization temperature (Tc) is measured from the first cooling curve. The Tm is the temperature measured at the peak of the endotherm, as shown on the heating curve. The Tc is the temperature measured at the peak of the exotherm, as shown on the cooling curve.

Representative Polymerization of an EO Copolymer: All materials (ethylene, 1-octene) and the process solvent (a narrow boiling range high-purity isoparaffinic solvent trademarked ISOPAR E, and commercially available from Exxon Mobil Corporation) were purified with molecular sieves, before introduction into the reaction environment. Hydrogen was supplied in pressurized cylinders, as a high purity grade, and was not further purified. The reactor monomer feed (ethylene) stream was pressurized, via a mechanical compressor, to above a reaction pressure of 525 psig. The solvent and comonomer (1-octene) feed was pressurized, via a mechanical positive displacement pump, to above reaction pressure at 525 psig. The individual catalyst components were manually batch diluted to specified component concentrations with purified solvent (ISOPAR E), and pressured to above reaction pressure of 525 psig. All reaction feed flows were measured with mass flow meters, and independently controlled with computer automated control systems. The polymerization took place via a continuous solution polymerization. The reactor consisted of a liquid full, non-adiabatic, isothermal, continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with an agitator. The reactor had independent control of all fresh solvent, monomer, comonomer, hydrogen, and catalyst component feeds. The fresh monomer and comonomer feed control was used to alter the polymer density. The combined solvent, monomer, comonomer and hydrogen feed to the reactor was temperature controlled from 5° C. to 50° C., and typically 25° C., by passing the feed stream though a heat exchanger. The fresh comonomer feed to the polymerization reactor was fed in with the solvent feed. The total fresh feed to the polymerization reactor was injected into the reactor at the bottom of the CSTR. The catalyst component (zirconium,[2,2′″-[1,3-propanediylbis(oxy-κO)bis[3″,5,5″-tris(1,1-dimethylethyl)-5′-methyl[1,1′:3′,1″-terphenyl]-2′-olato-κO]]dimethyl-,(OC-6-33)) was injected into the polymerization reactor through a specially designed injection stinger, and was injected at an angle at the bottom of the reactor. The primary catalyst component feed was computer controlled to maintain the reactor monomer concentration at a specified target. The two cocatalyst components (amines, bis(hydrogenated tallow alkyl)methyl, tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate(1-) and modified methyl aluminoxane (MMAO)) were fed based on calculated molar ratios to the primary catalyst component. The cocatalyst components were also injected into the polymerization reactor through a designed injection stinger similar to the catalyst injection. The contents of the reactor were continuously circulated by a two-blade agitator. The effluent from the first polymerization reactor (containing solvent, monomer, comonomer, hydrogen, catalyst components, and molten polymer) exited the CSTR, and was contacted with water to stop the reaction. In addition, various additives, such as antioxidants, were added at this point, in ppm amounts, as is custom in the industry. The stream was then transferred through a set of KENICS static mixing elements to evenly disperse the catalyst kill and additives. Following the additive addition, the effluent (containing solvent, monomer, hydrogen, catalyst components, and molten polymer) passes through a heat exchanger to remove lower boiling reaction components. The polymer stream was next devolatilized to remove solvent, hydrogen, and unreacted monomer and comonomer, and the polymer melt was pumped through a die, cooled by water, and cut into uniform solid pellets.

The oil-imbibed polymer and the thermoplastic resin (Dow H110-02N) were added to a HAAKE mixer bowl, heated to 190° C., and rotating at 35 rpm. The materials were mixed for four minutes at 75 rpm. The cure package (coagent TAIC, followed by peroxide LUPEROX 101-XL45 or LUPEROX F40M-SP) was added to the molten mixture, and the mixing was allowed to continue for three more minutes. The antioxidant was added, and the mixing was allowed to continue for one more minute. The melt was removed from the internal mixer, and allowed to further mix on a 2-roll mill (RELIABLE two roll mill mixer) at 190° C. The melt was passed through the roll mill to form a sheet, and the resulting sheet was rolled into a cigar-shaped specimen before being placed end-wise into a mill, and the “rolled sheet” was passed through the mill. This step was repeated six times, and then the sample was taken off the mill as a final sheet. The final sheet was preheated in a heated press (190° C.) for two minutes, under 2000 psi of pressure. Then the sheet was compression molded at 190° C., under 55000 psi of pressure, for four minutes, and then cooled for four minutes under 55000 psi of pressure. This procedure produced good test plaques without visible cracks. One series of plaques had dimensions in “7 inch×8 inch× 1/16 inch” and another series has dimensions “4 inch×6 inch×⅛ inch.” Shore A Hardness Hardness measurements were taken with a Shore A type durometer. The durometer was placed onto a plaque of approximately 3 mm thickness (⅛ inch), prepared according to the compression molding procedure above. Compression Set Compression set was measured according to ASTM D-395 at 70° C. and 120° C. Pucks of diameter of 29 mm(±0.5 mm) were extracted from the compression molded plaques of approximately 3 mm (⅛ inch) thickness. For each sample, four pucks were inspected for notches, uneven thickness and inhomogeneity, and were stacked, such that the total height was 12.5 mm(±0.5 mm), equating to compressive strain of 25%. Compression set was performed on two specimens, for each sample, at the two temperatures. The stacked pucks were placed in the compressive device, and locked into place; the apparatus was then placed at the appropriate temperature for specified time (22 hrs for 70° C. and 70 hrs for 120° C.). In this test, the stress is released at the test temperature, and the thickness of the sample is measured after a 30 minutes equilibration period, at room temperature. Compression set is a measure of the degree of recovery of a sample following compression, and is calculated according to the equation CS=(H0−H2)/(H0−H1), where H0 is the original thickness of the sample, H1 is the thickness of the spacer bar used, and H2 is the final thickness of the sample after removal of the compressive force. Stress-Strain Properties Tensile properties were measured at room temperature following ASTM D-412, on micro-tensile specimens ( 1/16 inch plaques) that were die cut from the same compression molded plaques in the mill direction. The tensile strain was calculated from the ratio of the increment of the length between clamps to the initial gauge length. The tensile stress was determined from dividing the tensile load by the initial cross section of the sample.

Inventive Examples 2 showed improvement in the compression sets (lower values) as compared to Comparative Example B. At the same Shore A hardness, Inventive Example 2 also showed increased 100% modulus, tensile strength and ultimate elongation, as compared to Comparative Example B.
