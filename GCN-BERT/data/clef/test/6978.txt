[Step 3] Synthesis of N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamide
Methyl3-fluoro-4-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamido)methyl)benzoate (0.300 g, 0.785 mmol), synthesized in step 2, and hydrazine hydrate (0.786 g, 15.692 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (20 mL), and the mixture was heated at reflux for 18 hours, and then cooled down to room temperature. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (0.250 g, 83.3 %) as a yellow foam solid.
