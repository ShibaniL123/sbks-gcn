EXAMPLE 81
5-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 81)
81.1: 5-(tert-butyl-dimethyl-silanyloxymethyl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
2.6 g (20 mmol) of tert-butyl-dimethyl-chlorosilane is added to a solution of 2 g (10 mmol) of 5-hydroxymethyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione and 2.4 g (40 mmol) of imidazole in 20 ml of dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is heated at 60Â° C. for 1.5 h. It is hydrolysed and then diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water and then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The white paste obtained is taken up in 10 ml of methanol and 100 ml of diethyl ether. The suspension is filtered to give 2.8 g (78%) of 5-(tert-butyl-dimethyl-silanyloxymethyl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione in the form of a white solid.
