No. A33-181: 1-(4-Cyanophenyl)-N-[2-oxo-1-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]methanesulfonamide
Ethyl (2E)-3-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)acrylate (1000 mg, 4.18 mmol) and spiro[3.3]hept-2-ylamine (561 mg, 3.80 mmol) were dissolved under argon in abs. N,N-dimethylformamide, and then N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1.32 mL, 7.60 mmol) was added. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at a temperature of 50° C. for 10 h and, after cooling to room temperature, water and ethyl acetate were added. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), ethyl (2E)-3-[5-nitro-2-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-ylamino)phenyl]acrylate (500 mg, 36% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.26 (d, 1H), 8.11 (m, 1H), 7.67 (d, 1H), 6.51 (m, 1H), 6.47 (d, 1H), 4.82 (br. m, 1H, NH), 4.29 (q, 2H), 3.88 (m, 1H), 2.60 (m, 2H), 2.12 (m, 2H), 2.01 (m, 2H), 1.95-1.85 (m, 4H), 1.37 (t, 3H). Ethyl (2E)-3-[5-nitro-2-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-ylamino)phenyl]acrylate (500 mg, 1.51 mmol) was then dissolved in abs. ethanol (8 mL), and (Ph3P)3RhCl (70 mg) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 5 min, hydrogen was introduced into the reaction solution with a constant gas flow via a gas introduction apparatus for 10 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by LCMS. On completion of conversion, the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), it was possible to isolate ethyl 3-[5-nitro-2-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-ylamino)phenyl]propanoate (490 mg, 97% of theory) as a colorless solid, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.04 (dd, 1H), 7.94 (d, 1H), 6.43 (d, 1H), 5.11 (br. m, 1H, NH), 4.28 (q, 2H), 3.87 (m, 1H), 2.81 (m, 2H), 2.67 (m, 2H), 2.58 (m, 2H), 2.11 (m, 2H), 2.00 (m, 2H), 1.92-1.85 (m, 4H), 1.28 (t, 3H). Ethyl 3-[5-nitro-2-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-ylamino)phenyl]propanoate (490 mg, 1.47 mmol) was dissolved in abs. tetrahydrofuran (8 mL) and added dropwise to a suspension, cooled down to 0° C., of sodium hydride (88 mg, 2.21 mmol, 60% suspension in oil) in abs. tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) under argon. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 h, and then water was added cautiously, followed by ethyl acetate after stirring for 5 min. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 6-nitro-1-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (180 mg, 43%) was isolated as a colorless solid, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 8.11-8.07 (m, 2H), 6.84 (d, 1H), 4.29 (m, 1H), 2.92 (m, 2H), 2.74 (m, 2H), 2.61 (m, 2H), 2.12 (m, 2H), 2.07 (m, 2H), 1.94-1.83 (m, 4H). In the next step, 6-nitro-1-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (180 mg, 2.44 mmol) was added together with tin(II) chloride dihydrate (567 mg, 2.52 mmol) to abs. ethanol and the mixture was stirred under argon at a temperature of 80° C. for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-water and then adjusted to pH 12 using aqueous NaOH. The aqueous phase was then extracted repeatedly with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 6-amino-1-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (151 mg, 94% of theory) was isolated as a highly viscous foam, 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3 δ, ppm) 6.59-6.53 (m, 3H), 4.32-3.80 (br. s, 2H, NH2), 4.21 (m, 1H), 2.72 (m, 2H), 2.67 (m, 2H), 2.48 (m, 2H), 2.12-2.06 (m, 4H), 1.93-1.80 (m, 4H). 6-Amino-1-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (120 mg, 0.47 mmol) was dissolved together with (4-cyanophenyl)methanesulfonyl chloride (111 mg, 0.52 mmol) in abs. acetonitrile (5 mL) in a baked-out round-bottom flask under argon, then pyridine (0.08 mL, 0.94 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure, the remaining residue was admixed with dil. HCl and dichloromethane, and the aqueous phase was extracted repeatedly with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. By column chromatography purification of the crude product obtained (ethyl acetate/heptane gradient), 1-(4-cyanophenyl)-N-[2-oxo-1-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl]methanesulfonamide (185 mg, 37% of theory) was isolated as a colorless solid.
