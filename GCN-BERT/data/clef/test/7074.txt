FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to visual training. More particularly, the present invention relates to a visual training device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Within vision training and testing, eye alignment is an area that, if weak, may hinder the subject when participating in various activities, such as sports, where eye alignment is helpful in tracking an object, such as a ball. To improve eye alignment, various tests may be used in training to exercise this particular visual skill. GB241387 discloses an apparatus for toning the ocular muscles and estimating binocular vision. The apparatus serves to train the ocular muscles by getting rid of the habit of "neglect" of vision in one eye and using only the vision of the other, that is, by restoring the habit of binocular vision, and correction in the movements follows. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Aspects of the invention as set out in the accompanying claims. The present invention generally relates to an eye alignment training device that may be used to train and improve an individual's ability to align their vision. In using this device, one end of the device is held by the user, while another end is secured, for example, to a wall. Between each ends, a connector may comprise sliding markers of various visual characteristics. For example, each marker may be of a different color. The markers may then be moved to different locations on the connector, and the subject moves his focus between the various markers. When not in use, the connector may be wound around one end of the device, or the device may have a retracting mechanism, which retracts the connector into the body of one of the end pieces. Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following, or may be learned by practice of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The present invention is described in detail below with reference to the attached drawing figures, wherein: FIGS. 1A-1B illustrate an example of an eye alignment training device in accordance with the present invention;FIGS. 2A-2D illustrate a further example of an eye alignment training device in accordance with the present invention; andFIGS. 3A-3D illustrate a further example of an eye alignment training device in accordance with the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The subject matter of the present invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Broadly speaking, eye alignment may be improved by performing eye alignment exercises. For example, a string, slender rope, tape or other substantially linear connector may be extended from near a subject's eyes to a relatively distant point, such as a point on a wall at least a few metres away, and the subject may sequentially focus upon different points along the connector, which will require that the subject's eyes be aligned with a different vergence angle required for successful focusing at each point. This exercise may be facilitated by providing movable sliders, such as beads, that may be moved along the connector and used as focus points by the subject. The present invention provides an eye alignment training device that may be easily deployed, used, stored, and transported. For example, simply using a string and beads to train a subject's eye alignment can present numerous challenges. When deploying a simple string, the string often cannot be readily affixed to a wall or other point. Further, using a simple string and beads can present challenges in use, as a simple string may be uncomfortable or even difficult to hold properly proximate to the subject's eye. Using a simple string and beads may yet further present challenges to store and/or transport, as the string can easily become knotted, tangled, snagged, etc. Systems in accordance with the present invention provide eye alignment training devices that are simple to deploy, use, store, and transport. Eye alignment training systems in accordance with the present invention provide a connector, which may be a string, slender rope, tape, or other elongated material. The connector may be stored within a cavity in a base piece when not in use. In accordance with the present invention, the base piece may retain the connector by permitting the connector to be wrapped around a groove in the exterior of the base, by permitting the connector to be stored within a cavity enclosed within the base, or by some combination of wrapping the connector around the exterior of the base and storing the connector within the base. Slidable markers may be movably positioned on the connector, and may likewise be stored on or within the base piece. The base piece may be configured to be easily held by the subject and/or to be easily mounted at the distant end of the training device. In its extended configuration, an end piece may be located on the end of the connector opposite the base piece. The end piece may be configured to be easily held by the subject and/or to be easily mounted at the distant end of the training device. In this way, one of either the end piece or the base may be affixed at a relatively distant point, and the other may be grasped by the subject near his or her eyes, with the connector extended between the base and the end piece. The slidable markers may be positioned at one or more desired locations along the length of the connector, and the subject may then perform eye alignment focusing exercises using one or more of the positioned slidable markers as a focus point. Generally, one end of the connector will be positioned at approximately the nose of an individual and the other end of the connector will extend to a wall or other steady object at a distance of at least a few meters, and ideally approximately three or more metres, from the subject. In that way, slidable markers may provide focus points at distances varying from very near the subject's eyes, which will require a very high vergence angle, to at or near "optical infinity" from a subject, at which point a subject's eyes should ideally be parallel. In use, a subject may determine that he/she has properly focused on a given marker that is not at optical infinity because the connector will appear to "cross" at the connector serving as the current focus point when the subject has successfully focused on that marker. A variety of configurations may be used for the base and end piece to permit them to be easily held by the subject and/or affixed at a relatively distant point. Additionally, a variety of configurations of the base may be used to permit the connector and slidable markers to be retained around and/or within the base. Some exemplary configurations of the base and end piece, as well as other exemplary aspects of eye alignment training devices in accordance with the present invention, are described in more detail below. Turning now to FIGS. 1A-1B, an eye alignment training device 100 with sliding markers is provided. The training device 100 includes a base piece 105, a connector 110, and sliding markers 115. FIG. 1A shows the training device 100 in a storage mode whereby the connector 110 is contained within cavities of the base piece 105. That is, the connector 110 is illustrated wrapped around the base piece 105 in a groove provided on the perimeter of base piece 105, and the sliding markers 115 and the portion of connector 110 occupied by markers 115 and end piece 135, are stored in a cavity comprising a gap 120 within the base piece 105. Any number of sliding markers 115 may be used in accordance with the present invention. The illustrated example shown in FIG. 1A shows five such sliding markers 115. The sliding markers 115 may be of any desired size or shape, depending on the use of the device, but each sliding marker 115 may possess a visual characteristic (e.g., a color or pattern) that allows a subject to differentiate between each sliding marker. Further, each marker is capable of sliding or moving down the connector 110, as shown in FIG. 1B. At the end of the connector opposite base piece 105, an end piece 130 is provided. Such an end piece 130 may be fixed on the connector 110 and may provide a stopper to the sliding markers 115. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 1B, end piece 130 may be secured to the connector and used to connect or stabilize the end of the connector 110 to a wall 140 or other substantially solid object (not illustrated). As shown in FIG. 1B, the end piece 130 has a protrusion 135 at its far end, which detachably mates with a corresponding recess (not illustrated) in a fastener such as wall plate 145 is used to detachably tether the connector 110 to a wall plate 145 that is attached to wall 140. End piece 130 and wall plate 145 may utilize a pair of attractive magnets (not illustrated) to facilitate detachably affixing end piece 130 to wall plate 140. A plurality of wall plates 145 may be utilized to permit connector 110 to be stretched in a variety of angles and inclinations relative to subject. End piece 130 may be utilized as a visual marker itself, or alternatively may be used solely to tether the end of connector 110 opposite from base 105 Turning now to FIGS. 2A-2D, another embodiment in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. In this example, the device 200 includes a base piece 205, a connector 210, sliding markers 215, and an end piece 230. As with the previous example, any number of sliding markers may be used with this embodiment. As shown in FIG. 2A, the connector 210 is extended. In this embodiment, the connector 210 is able to retract into an enclosed cavity contained within the base piece 205, as is shown in FIGS. 2B and 2C. The retraction mechanism within the base piece 205 allows the device 200 to assume an overall compact shape for storage. The retracting mechanism may comprise openings, such as opening 220 and 225, that may be used to wind the connector 210 within the base piece 205. The base piece 205 also may include an opening 235 at the end of the base piece 205 opposing the connector 210 and end piece 230. Opening 235 may be used to secure the device, as is illustrated in FIG. 2D. In this example, the device 200 is attached to wall 240 using opening 235, which may slide over a fastener that is affixed to wall 240 to detachably mate the opening 235 and the fastener. The subject may then extend the connector 210 by holding onto the end piece 230. Turning now to FIGS. 3A-3D, another embodiment of an eye alignment training device 300 in accordance with the present invention is provided. In this embodiment, the training device 300 includes a base piece 305, a connector 310, sliding markers 315, and an end piece 340. This embodiment is capable of retracting the connector 310 into a cavity enclosed within the base piece 305 via the opening 335. The retraction mechanism within the base piece 305 may be powered by a spring assembly or any other mechanism and may be initiated by pressing the button illustrated at 325. Further, in this embodiment, the button 325 may individually release each sliding marker 315 using door 330. With each depression of button 325, the door 330 may raise, thereby allowing one or more sliding marker 315 to exit the cavity within the base piece 305 at opening 335. On the other hand, while door 330 is lowered slideable marker 315 is retained within cavity of base piece 305. FIG. 3B illustrates such an example prior to a sliding marker being released. And, FIG. 3A shows a sliding marker 315 on the connector 310 that has just been released from the opening 335. Although any method of connected or securing the connector may be used with any of the embodiments illustrated and discussed herein, FIG. 3C shows an end piece 340 with an opening 345. A fastener such as a hook, shown as 350, may be used to secure the end piece 340 by detachably mating the hook 350 with the end piece 340, and thus the connector 310 and training device 300. The hook 350 may be affixed to a wall or any other location where training may occur. In using this embodiment, the subject may secure the end piece 340, as shown in FIG. 3C, and then may extend the connector 310 with the sliding markers 315, and hold the device 300 under the nose so that the connector 310 and sliding markers 315 are within his line of sight. From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all the ends and objects hereinabove set forth together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the structure. It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations.
