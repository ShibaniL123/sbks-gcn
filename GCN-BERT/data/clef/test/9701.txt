NOVEL IMMUNOGENIC COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of Invention [0001] This invention relates to a novel chimeric virus and immunogenic compositions containing the chimeric virus which, when administered to an animal, can induced an immune response to both NDV and ILTV. This invention relates more specifically to NDV LaSota strain expressing ILTV gB or gD antigens, immunogenic compositions containing one or both chimeric viruses, and methods of use thereof. Description of the Prior Art [0002] Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), classified as a disease requiring notification to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease that has become a major problem in the U.S. poultry industry in recent years and is caused by infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), formally called Gallid herpesvirus type 1 (GaHV- 1). For protection, chickens are vaccinated multiple times with live strains that were attenuated by either multiple passages in embryonated eggs (chicken embryo origin [CEO] or in tissue culture (tissue culture origin) [TCO]). Although these vaccines protect against clinical disease, they have residual virulence which is exacerbated by continued infections of naive birds from productively infected animals and latent carriers. Moreover, the CEO vaccine strain has been demonstrated to mutate and become more virulence simply by bird- to-bird passage. Because of this characteristic, it is believed that U.S. vaccine strains have mutated to become more virulent and these "revertants" have become the dominant field strains in the poultry population. As a result of this increased virulence in the circulating virus and the use of high-density poultry housing, there is a continuous reservoir of viruses (both virulent and vaccinal) in flocks that is capable of evolving to higher levels of virulence. [0003] To overcome problems associated with live attenuated ILTV vaccine strains, inactivate whole- virus vaccines and turkey herpesvirus (HVT)- and fowl poxvirus (FPV)- vectored constructs containing ILTV antigens have been developed and tested in protection studies. Although these vaccines are completely safe when administered at different ages, they induce only partial protection when compared with that induced by a live- attenuated ILTV vaccine. As such, a significant need exists for a new ILT vaccine strategy, particularly regarding the development of next generation vaccines or immunogenic compositions that are inexpensive, incapable of virulent reversion, and unable to transfer horizontally to naive birds, in order to control the disease and prevent devastating losses. [0004] ILTV, an alphaherpesvirus, possesses at least ten envelope glycoprotein genes, including glycoprotein B (gB) and glycoprotein D (gD) which are the most highly conserved herpesvirus structural glycoproteins. Glycoprotein B is essential for infectivity and is involved in membrane fusion and virus penetration. Glycoprotein D is essential for most herpesviruses and functions as a receptor for virus binding to susceptible cells. In addition, gB elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses, and has been shown to be a strong candidate antigen for recombinant subunit vaccines. [0005] Newcastle disease (ND), caused by infection of virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is one of the most serious infectious diseases in poultry. It has been classified into one serotype and three different pathotypes: velogenic (highly virulent), mesogenic (moderately virulent), and lentogenic (low virulence) viruses. Velogenic strains can cause severe disease, characterized by extensive lesions and high mortality in both the laboratory and field, and such outbreaks require reporting to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) by member nations. [0006] Vaccination combined with strict biosecurity practices have been recommended for controlling NDV outbreaks for over 60 years. The NDV LaSota strain, a naturally-occurring low virulence NDV strain, has been routinely used as a live vaccine throughout the world for more than fifty years to prevent ND. This vaccine strain induces strong immunity both locally and systemically and can be readily administered through drinking water supplies or by directly spraying the birds. The LaSota vaccine has been proven to be safe and stable, and there are no reports of virulence reversion or recombination for this vaccine strain to generate new virulent strains. [0007] NDV is a negative-sense single-strand RNA virus which contains a negative-sense RNA inside its capsid. After entry into a cell, the virus/cell makes positive-sense RNAs (mRNA and anti-genomic RNA) which are used to generate viral proteins and nascent negative- sense single-strand RNAs which are packaged into virions. The negative-sense ssRNA sequence of NDV is the reverse complement of the cDNA sequence of the viral RNA. [0008] Others have explored using recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) LaSota strain (rLS) as a vector for presenting heterologous antigens to an animal's immune system. Much of this work involved the use of rNDV vector for combating human diseases, although some involved vaccines for avain pathogenic microorganisms. See, Bukreyev and Collins, Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 10(l):46-55 (2008) using of rNDV as a vector for respiratory tract disease antigens for humans; Bukreyev, et al, J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. 103:8203-8208 (2006) examining rNDV expressing ectodomain of an H7 avian influenza virus hemagglutinin; and Swayne, et al, Avian Dis. 47:1047-1050 (2003) examining expression of avian influenza virus H7 hemagglutinin in rNDV. [0009] Previously, a chimeric virus of NDV LaSota strain and a heterologous antigen (glycoprotein from three separate strains of avian metapneumovirus (aMPV)) was generated and evaluated as an immunogenic composition to generate a protective immune response against both NDV and aMPV (aMPV-A, aMPV-B, or aMPV-C) (Hu, et al, Vaccine 29:8624- 8633 (2011) and Yu, et al , World J. of Vaccines 3:130-139 (2013)). The DNA sequence of the heterologous antigen was placed between the F gene and HN gene of the NDV LaSota strain. In these three cases, the chimeric virus failed to induce a sufficiently robust immune response in the inoculated animal to protect the inoculated animal against the disease caused by aMPV (turkey rhinotracheitis), even when the animal was exposed to the aMPV strain from which the glycoprotein (heterologous antigen) was obtained. While not wishing to be bound to any hypothesis, the incomplete protection could have resulted from one or more factors including, but not limited to, the use of a weak antigen which was unable to stimulate a sufficiently robust immune response to protect the inoculated animal, low production of the foreign antigen by the cell because of the location the sequences encoding the heterologous antigen were inserted into NDV s genomic RNA, and poor replication of the chimeric virus in the inoculated animal. [0010] To overcome numerous problems associated with live attenuated ILTV strains, a recombinant NDV LaSota strain is used as a live vaccine vector to express ILTV's gB or gD genes (a chimeric virus). This chimeric vaccine is an immunogenic composition that, after administration to an animal, induces an immune response in the recipient to both NDV and ILTV and prevents both diseases. In light of prior failures of a chimeric virus of NDV LaSota strain and a heterologous antigen, it is surprising and unexpected result that the animals inoculated with the chimeric virus of the present invention generate a sufficiently robust immune response to be protected from ILTV and the disease it causes.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES [0024] Figure 1 illustrates the construction of pLS/ILTV-gB and pLS/ILTV-gD. The ORF of the ILTV gB gene or ILTV gD gene is inserted into the plasmid encoding NDV LaSota genes between the P and M genes as an additional transcription unit using the In- Fusion® PCR cloning kit. The direction of the T7 promoter is indicated by an arrow. HDVRz and Τ7Φ represent the site of the Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and the T7 terminator sequences, respectively. [0025] Figure 2A illustrates the total clinical sign scores of specific-pathogen- free (SPF) chickens after ILTV challenge at 21 days post-inoculation with rLS-GFP (squares), rLS/ILTV-gB (triangles), rLS/ILTV-gD (asterisks), or mock inoculation (phosphate buffered solution (PBS)) (diamonds). Figure 2B illustrates the total clinical signs of specific- pathogen-free chickens after ILTV challenge at 28 days post-inoculation with rLS-GFP (squares), rLS/ILTV-gB (triangles), and rLS/ILTV-gD (asterisks). [0026] Figure 3 shows the reduction in relative ILTV shedding load in tracheal lumen and tears of ILTV-challenged (strain 63140) birds at 4 days post-challenge, where challenge occurred at 21 and 28 days post- inoculation with rLS/ILTV-gB (black bars) or rLS/ILTV-gD (grey bars) as compared to the shedding of ILTV from rLS-GFP inoculated birds (control). Ct values for the gC amplicon are compared to Ct values of the endogenous control (collagen amplicon) using the relative 2"DeltaDelta method. [0027] Figure 4 shows the total clinical sign scores of broilers after three days post-challenge with virulent ILTV at 21 days post-inoculation with rLS-GFP, rLS/ILTV-gB, CEO, TCO, or mock inoculation (PBS). [0028] Figure 5 shows the relative reduction in viral shedding (ILTV) in trachea of ILTV- challenged (strain 63140) birds at 4 days post-challenge. Birds are inoculated with either rLS/ILTV-gB, rLS-GFP, mock inoculation (PBS), or the ILTV vaccine strains CEO or TCO. Ct values for the gC amplicon are compared to Ct values of the endogenous control (collagen amplicon) using the relative 2"DeltaDelta method. [0029] Figure 6 illustrates that the body-weight gains between inoculated (mock inoculation (PBS), rsLS-GFP, rLS/ILTV-gB, CEO, or TCO) and control birds from age of 42 to 51 days after challenge. The body- weight gain rate of inoculated birds is compared with that of the control (unvaccinated/non-challenged) broilers using the student t-Test. Statistically significant difference occurs when P value is < 0.05; P value > 0.05 is not statistically significant. [0030] Figure 7 shows the relative reduction in viral shedding (ILTV) in tears of ILTV- challenged (strain 63140) birds at 4 days post-challenge. Birds are vaccinated with either rLS/ILTV-gB, rLS-GFP, mock inoculation (PBS), or the ILTV vaccine strains CEO or TCO. Ct values for the gC amplicon are compared to Ct values of the endogenous control (collagen amplicon) using the relative 2"DeltaDelta method. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0031 ] This invention involves a chimeric virus of NDV LaSota strain carrying polynucleotides encoding a heterologous protein, namely either glycoprotein B (gB) or glycoprotein D (gD) of ILTV. This chimeric virus, when administered to an animal, can induce an immune response in the animal to both NDV and to gB or gD. Further, it is a surprising and unexpected result based on prior work by the inventor that the immune response generated by this chimeric virus can protect the animal from infection by and/or diseases caused by NDV and ILTV. In this present invention, the polynucleotides encoding the heterologous antigen is placed between the coding sequences for NDV P and M proteins (see Fig. 1). This invention involves immunogenic compositions containing the chimeric virus, method of using the immunogenic compositions, the polynucleotide sequences of the chimeric viruses, and the expression vectors or plasmid used to generate the chimeric viruses. [0032] In addition, an immunogenic composition can contain a mixture of rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gD. One can produce each chimeric virus (rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gD) independently of each other, storing one or both batches if necessary, and then mixing the two chimeric viruses together with proportions ranging from approximately 1 % to approximately 99% for one chimeric virus and from approximately 1% to approximately 99% for the other chimeric virus prior to administering both chimeric viruses to the animal. Alternatively, an immunogenic composition containing rLS/ILTV-gB and an immunogenic composition containing rLS/ILTV-gD could be mixed together prior to administering the combined immunogenic composition to the animal. In another embodiment, one can infect cells in tissue culture with both rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gD and then purify the chimeric viruses produced. For this alternatively embodiment, it may possibly be difficult to control, from batch to batch, the quantity of each chimeric virus in the immunogenic product; but that does not negate the ability to produce an immunogenic composition containing both chimeric viruses. [0033] While combination vaccines which generate an immune response in an animal to NDV and to another virus are being sold commercially, these vaccines are simply a mixture of the two viruses, administered together. In contrast, the present invention is a chimeric virus of NDV encoding and expressing a heterologous protein (or antigen) from a different virus; in particular gB or gD of ILTV. [0034] As used herein, "about", "approximately," "substantially," and "significantly" will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art and will vary to some extent on the context in which they are used. If there are uses of the term which are not clear to persons of ordinary skill in the art given the context in which it is used, "about" and "approximately" will mean plus or minus <10% of the particular term and "substantially" and "significantly" will mean plus or minus >10 of the particular term. [0035] Because this invention involves production and purification of recombinant virus expressing a heterologous antigen (a chimeric virus) that may be administered to an animal, the following definitions are provided to assist in describing this invention. The terms "isolated", "purified", or "biologically pure" as used herein, refer to material that is substantially or essentially free from components that normally accompany the material in its native state or when the material is produced. In an exemplary embodiment, purity and homogeneity are determined using analytical chemistry techniques such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography. A nucleic acid or particular bacteria that are the predominant species present in a preparation is substantially purified. In an exemplary embodiment, the term "purified" denotes that a nucleic acid or protein that gives rise to essentially one band in gel after being subjected to electrophoresis. Typically, isolated nucleic acids or proteins have a level of purity expressed as a range. The lower end of the range of purity for the component is about 60%, about 70% or about 80% and the upper end of the range of purity is about 70%, about 80%, about 90% or more than about 90%. [0036] The term "nucleic acid" as used herein, refers to a polymer of ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides. Typically, "nucleic acid" polymers occur in either single- or double- stranded form, but are also known to form structures comprising three or more strands. The term "nucleic acid" includes naturally occurring nucleic acid polymers as well as nucleic acids comprising known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Exemplary analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2- O-methyl ribonucleotides, and peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs). " DNA", "RNA", "polynucleotides", "polynucleotide sequence", "oligonucleotide", "nucleotide", "nucleic acid", "nucleic acid molecule", "nucleic acid sequence", "nucleic acid fragment", and "isolated nucleic acid fragment" are used interchangeably herein. [0037] For nucleic acids, sizes are given in either kilobases (kb) or base pairs (bp). Estimates are typically derived from agarose or acrylamide gel electrophoresis, from sequenced nucleic acids, or from published DNA sequences. For proteins, sizes are given in daltons (Da), kilodaltons (kDa) or amino acid residue numbers. Proteins sizes are estimated from gel electrophoresis, from sequenced proteins, from derived amino acid sequences, or from published protein sequences. [0038] Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions), the complementary (or complement) sequence, and the reverse complement sequence, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (see e.g., Batzer et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al, J. Biol. Chem. 260:2605-2608 (1985); and Rossolini et al, Mol. Cell. Probes 8:91-98(1994)). [0039] In addition to the degenerate nature of the nucleotide codons which encode amino acids, alterations in a polynucleotide that result in the production of a chemically equivalent amino acid at a given site, but do not affect the functional properties of the encoded polypeptide, are well known in the art. "Conservative amino acid substitutions" are those substitutions that are predicted to interfere least with the properties of the reference polypeptide. In other words, conservative amino acid substitutions substantially conserve the structure and the function of the reference protein. Thus, a codon for the amino acid alanine, a hydrophobic amino acid, may be substituted by a codon encoding another less hydrophobic residue, such as glycine, or a more hydrophobic residue, such as valine, leucine, or isoleucine. Similarly, changes which result in substitution of one negatively charged residue for another, such as aspartic acid for glutamic acid, or one positively charged residue for another, such as lysine for arginine or histidine, can also be expected to produce a functionally equivalent protein or polypeptide. Table 1 provides a list of exemplary conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions generally maintain (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a beta sheet or alpha helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the site of the substitution, and/or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Table 1 <¾t, C k & [0040] As contemplated herein, a polypeptide, protein, or peptide may be further modified to include non-amino acid moieties. Modifications may include but are not limited to acylation (e.g., O-acylation (esters), N-acylation (amides), S-acylation (thioesters)), acetylation (e.g., the addition of an acetyl group, either at the N-terminus of the protein or at lysine residues), formylation lipoylation (e.g., attachment of a lipoate, a C8 functional group), myristoylation (e.g., attachment of myristate, a C14 saturated acid), palmitoylation (e.g., attachment of palmitate, a C16 saturated acid), alkylation (e.g., the addition of an alkyl group, such as an methyl at a lysine or arginine residue), isoprenylation or prenylation (e.g., the addition of an isoprenoid group such as farnesol or geranylgeraniol), amidation at C-terminus, glycosylation (e.g., the addition of a glycosyl group to either asparagine, hydroxylysine, serine, or threonine, resulting in a glycoprotein). Distinct from glycation, which is regarded as a nonenzymatic attachment of sugars, polysialylation (e.g., the addition of polysialic acid), glypiation (e.g., glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor formation), hydroxylation, iodination (e.g., of thyroid hormones), and phosphorylation (e.g., the addition of a phosphate group, usually to serine, tyrosine, threonine or histidine) are possible. [0041 ] The term "recombinant" when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, or nucleic acid, protein, or vector, indicates that the cell, organism, nucleic acid, protein or vector, has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells may express genes that are not found within the native (non- recombinant or wild-type) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed - over-expressed, under-expressed or not expressed at all. [0042] The terms "transgenic", "transformed", "transformation", and "transfection" are similar in meaning to "recombinant". "Transformation", "transgenic", and "transfection" refer to the transfer of a polynucleotide into the genome of a host organism (including a virus) or into a cell. Such a transfer of polynucleotides can result in genetically stable inheritance of the polynucleotides or in the polynucleotides remaining extra-chromosomally (not integrated into the chromosome of the cell). Genetically stable inheritance may potentially require the transgenic organism or cell to be subjected for a period of time to one or more conditions which require the transcription of some or all of transferred polynucleotide in order for the transgenic organism or cell to live and/or grow. Polynucleotides that are transformed into a cell but are not integrated into the host's chromosome remain as an expression vector within the cell. One may need to grow the cell under certain conditions in order for the expression vector to remain in the cell or the cell's progeny. Further, for expression to occur the organism or cell may need to be kept under certain conditions. Host organisms or cells containing the recombinant polynucleotide can be referred to as "transgenic" or "transformed" organisms or cells or simply as "transformants", as well as recombinant organisms or cells. A virus containing polynucleotides encoding a foreign gene is referred to as a "chimeric virus". [0043] Oligonucleotides and polynucleotides that are not commercially available can be chemically synthesized e.g., according to the solid phase phosphoramidite triester method first described by Beaucage and Caruthers, Tetrahedron Letts. 22: 1859-1862 (1981), or using an automated synthesizer, as described in Van Devanter et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 12:6159- 6168 (1984). Other methods for synthesizing oligonucleotides and polynucleotides are known in the art. Purification of oligonucleotides is by either native acrylamide gel electrophoresis or by anion-exchange HPLC as described in Pearson & Reanier, /. Chrom. 255: 137-149 (1983). [0044] This invention utilizes routine techniques in the field of molecular biology. Basic texts disclosing the general methods of use in this invention include Green and Sambrook, 4th ed. 2012, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual (1993); and Ausubel et al. , eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1994 - current, John Wiley & Sons. Unless otherwise noted, technical terms are used according to conventional usage. Definitions of common terms in molecular biology maybe found in e.g., Benjamin Lewin, Genes IX, published by Oxford University Press, 2007 (ISBN 0763740632); Krebs, et al. (eds.), The Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology, published by Blackwell Science Ltd., 1994 (ISBN 0-632-02182-9); and Robert A. Meyers (ed.), Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: a Comprehensive Desk Reference, published by VCH Publishers, Inc., 1995 (ISBN 1-56081-569-8). [0045] The term "vector" refers to some means by which DNA, RNA, a protein, or polypeptide can be introduced into a host. The polynucleotides, protein, and polypeptide which are to be introduced into a host can be therapeutic or prophylactic in nature; can encode or be an antigen; can be regulatory in nature; etc. There are various types of vectors including virus, plasmid, bacteriophages, cosmids, and bacteria. As used herein, a "viral vector" refers to recombinant viral nucleic acid that has been engineered to express a heterologous polypeptide (e.g. , ILTV gB or ILTV gD or antigenic fragments thereof). The viral vector may include ds-acting elements for expression of the heterologous polypeptide. The recombinant viral nucleic acid typically is capable of being packaged into a helper virus that is capable of infecting a host cell. For example, the recombinant viral nucleic acid may include ds-acting elements for packaging. The chimeric virus maybe replication incompetent, attenuated, or at least does not cause disease. The chimeric virus may also induce an immune response against antigens normally present on the virus or encoded by the viral vector. The viral vector may be genetically altered by modern molecular biological methods (e.g. , restriction endonuclease and ligase treatment, and rendered less virulent than wild type), typically by deletion of specific genes. For example, the recombinant viral nucleic acid may lack a gene essential for production of infectious or virulent virus. [0046] The recombinant viral nucleic acid may function as a vector for an immunogenic ILTV protein by virtue of the recombinant viral nucleic acid containing polynucleotides which encoding for ILTV antigen(s). The recombinant viral nucleic acid, packaged in a chimeric virus, may be introduced into a subject by standard methods for inoculation of immunogenic compositions containing a live virus. An immunogenic composition of the invention can be administered at, for example, approximately 104 to approximately 108 viruses/dose, or approximately 106 to approximately 109 pfu/dose. Actual dosages of such an immunogenic composition can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the field of vaccine technology. [0047] The transgene expressed in the chimeric virus disclosed herein may have the native polynucleotide sequence of ILTV gB and/or gD or may have a polynucleotide sequence that has been modified. For example, the presently disclosed chimeric virus may express polypeptides from polynucleotides that have been codons optimized, that is changed for enhanced expression in a particular host. For example, presently disclosed chimeric virus may include one or more polypeptides from ILTV where the encoding polynucleotide sequence is optimized to include codons that are most prevalent in an avian, such as a chicken. Codon usage for the chicken genome has been reported. (See Rao, et al. , DNA Res., 18(6):499-512 (2011)). [0048] "Antibody" or "antibodies" encompass polyclonal and monoclonal antibody preparations, as well as preparations including hybrid antibodies; altered antibodies; chimeric antibodies; humanized antibodies (see, e.g., Riechmann, et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyan, et al., Science 239: 1534-1536 (1988); and U.K. Patent Publication No. GB 2,276,169, published 21 Sep. 1994); hybrid antibody molecules (see, for example, Winter, et al, Nature 349:293-299 (1991); and U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567); F(ab')2 and F(ab) fragments; Fv molecules (noncovalent heterodimers, see, for example, Inbar, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69:2659-2662 (1972); and Ehrlich, et al., Biochem. 19:4091-4096 (1980)); single-chain Fv molecules (sFv) (see, e.g. , Huston, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883 (1988)); dimeric and trimeric antibody fragment constructs; minibodies (see, e.g. , Pack, et al., Biochem. 31 : 1579-1584 (1992); Cumber, et al., J. Immunology 149B: 120-126 (1992)); and, any functional fragments obtained from such molecules, wherein such fragments retain specific-binding properties of the parent antibody molecule. [0049] An "immunogenic composition" is a composition that contains one or more antigens such that the administration of the immunogenic composition to an animal results in an immune response to the antigen(s). Such an immune response in the animal may be a humoral and/or a cellular immune response to the antigen(s). The antigen(s) is also referred herein as an "immunogenic agent". A humoral response involves an antibody response; an immunized subject is induced to produce antibodies against an administered antigen (e.g. , IgY, IgA, IgM, IgG, or other antibody isotypes). A cellular response or cell-mediated response may involve a cytotoxic T-cell response against cells expressing the peptides derived from an administered antigen in the context of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule. A cellular response is mediated by T-lymphocytes and/or other white blood cells. An "immunological response" or "immune response" to an antigen or immunogenic composition is, in an animal, the development, increase, or decrease of a humoral and/or a cellular immune response to the antigen or antigen present in the immunogenic composition. The immune response may be an increased or enhanced immune response (immuno-stimulatory) or a decrease or suppression of an immune response (immuno-suppressant). The immune response may be a systemic and/or localized immune response. As used herein, "potentiating" or "enhancing" an immune response means increasing the magnitude and/or the breadth of the immune response. For example, the number of cells that recognize a particular epitope may be increased ("magnitude") and/or the numbers of epitopes that are recognized may be increased ("breadth"). [0050] "Vaccination", "vaccinate", "immunization", "immunize", and "inoculate" are synonymous and are the administration of the antigens or immunogenic composition to the animal. These terms can also include removing immunological cells from the animal, allowing such immunological cells to interact with an antigen in-vitro, and then returning those immunological cells or their progeny back to the animal's body. Exemplary routes of administration of the antigens or immunogenic composition of this invention include, but not limited to, intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, subdermal injection, intradermal injection, subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection, oral administration, sublingual administration, vaginal administration, rectal administration, transmucosally, transcutaneous adsorption, intranodal administration, intracoronary administration, intraarterial administration, intratracheal administration, intraarticular administration, intraventricular administration, intracranial administration, intraspinal administration, intraocular administration, aural administration, inhalation, eye drop administration, and intranasal administration. For this invention, oral administration may involve an animal eating a plant or plant cells which contain the antigen; or ingesting animal feed containing the antigens or immunogenic composition; or ingesting water containing the antigens or immunogenic composition. Such oral administration may result in mucosal immunity to the pathogens against which the antigens are directed. Another mode of administration is spraying the immunogenic composition on the animal. Vaccination and immunization involves inducing an immune response in the animal receiving the antigens or immunogenic composition. The immunogenic composition could be administered once to an animal. Alternatively, one can administer two or more dosages to the animal under a prime -boost regimen. [0051 ] The immunogenic compositions may be administered prophylactically or therapeutically. In prophylactic administration, the immunogenic composition may be administered in an amount sufficient to induce immune responses for protecting against infection of the organism(s) which contain the antigen (i.e. , a "immunogenic effective dose" or a "prophylactically effective dose"). In therapeutic administration, the immunogenic composition may be administered in an amount sufficient to induce immune responses for treating the disease or condition for which the subject suffers and for which the therapeutic agent being administered to the subject is designed to treat. A prophylactic antigen or prophylactic immunogenic composition can be administered to the animal, especially to the young of the animal, to pregnant animals, and to elderly animals. The age of the young animal will vary depending on the animal's lifespan and if the young has maternal antibodies upon birth or, if the animal is a mammal, obtains maternal antibodies during nursing. Administering a prophylactic immunogenic composition to a pregnant animal may help stimulate the immune response of the fetus or baby animal prior to and shortly after birth. It may also stimulate the pregnant animal' s immune system thereby improving the pregnant animal' s health. Of course, administering prophylactic compositions to an elderly animal may boost the elderly animal's immune system to the antigen contained with the composition and thus help prevent the elderly animal from being infected with the bacteria, virus, or parasite containing the antigen. Administering an immunosuppressant composition would be considered a prophylactic administration in that one desires to reduce the animal' s response to the antigen contained in the immunosuppressant composition prior to the animal's next expose to the antigen. [0052] For immunogenic compositions and antigens, "treatment" refers to any of (i) the prevention of infection or reinfection, as in a traditional vaccine, (ii) the reduction or elimination of symptoms, (iii) the substantial or complete elimination of the pathogen in question, (iv) an enhanced immune response to the antigen or immunogenic composition administered to the animal, and/or (v) the reduction of a hypersensitive immune response in the animal. Treatment may be effected prophylactically (prior to infection or exposure to the antigen or infectious agent) or therapeutically (following infection or exposure to the antigen or infectious agent). [0053] The immunogenic compositions disclosed herein may be formulated for administration to a subject in need thereof. Such immunogenic compositions can be formulated and/or administered in dosages and by techniques well-known to those skilled in the medical/veterinarian arts. The appropriate dose of the immunogenic composition of the present invention depends on several variables, such as but not limited to, the formulation, the route of administration, the animal's age, the animal's sex, the animal's weight, the time of administration, the excretion rate, reaction irritability, and condition of the particular subject and the route of administration. The immunogenic compositions may include carriers, diluents, or excipients as known in the art. Further, the compositions may include preservatives (e.g. , anti-microbial or anti-bacterial agents such as benzalkonium chloride) or adjuvants. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the appropriate dose by administering the antigen to the animal and assaying for an increase or, if applicable, a decrease in the immune response. [0054] One method of assessing efficacy of an immunogenic composition involves monitoring an infection after administration of the immunogenic composition. One method of assessing efficacy of prophylactic administration of the immunogenic composition involves monitoring immune responses against the antigens in the immunogenic composition after administration of the immunogenic composition. Another method of assessing the immunogenicity of the antigens of the immunogenic composition is to express the antigens recombinantly and to screen an animal's sera or mucosal secretions by immunoblot. A positive reaction between the antigen and the animal' s serum indicates that the animal previously mounted an immune response to the antigen in question-that is, the antigen is an immunogen. This method may also be used to identify immunodominant proteins and/or epitopes. [0055] Another method involves intentionally infecting the vaccinated animal or allowing the vaccinated animal to be in the presence of infected, non-vaccinated animals and monitoring for symptoms of illness. Alternatively, one may monitor immune responses both systemically (such as monitoring the level of IgGi and IgG2a production) and mucosally (such as monitoring the level of IgA production) against the antigens in the immunogenic composition after administration of the immunogenic composition. Typically, serum specific antibody responses are determined post-immunization but pre-challenge, whereas mucosal specific antibody body responses are determined post-immunization and post-challenge. [0056] Immunogenic compositions of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other antigens and/or optionally with an immunoregulatory agent ("adjuvant"). An adjuvant is a compound or mixture that enhances the immune response to an antigen. An adjuvant can serve as a tissue depot that slowly releases the antigen and also as a lymphoid system activator that non-specifically enhances the immune response. Examples of adjuvants which may be employed include MPL-TDM adjuvant (monophosphoryl Lipid A / synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate, e.g. , available from GSK Biologies). Another suitable adjuvant is the immunostimulatory adjuvant AS021/AS02 (GSK). These immunostimulatory adjuvants are formulated to give a strong T cell response and include QS-21, a saponin from Quillay saponaria, the TL4 ligand, a monophosphoryl lipid A, together in a lipid or liposomal carrier. Other adjuvants include, but are not limited to, E. coli LT (or LT-B, native or toxoid), squalene and squalene-like compounds, nonionic block co-polymer adjuvants {e.g. , CRL1005), aluminum phosphates {e.g. , A1P04), R-848 (a Thl-like adjuvant), imiquimod, PAM3CYS, poly (I:C), loxoribine, potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and Corynebacterium parvum, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), cholera toxin derived antigens (e.g. , CTA1-DD), lipopoly saccharide adjuvants, complete Freund's adjuvant, incomplete Freund's adjuvant, saponin, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil or hydrocarbon emulsions in water (e.g. , MF59 available from Novartis Vaccines or Montanide ISA 720), water-in-oil-in-water emulsion, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, and dinitrophenol. Adjuvants which are capable of preferential stimulation of the Thl cell response are described in International Patent Application No. WO 94/00153 and WO 95/17209. [0057] The immunogenic composition may be prepared for administration by formulating an effective immunization dosage of the antigen(s) (chimeric virus) with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, such as physiological saline or tissue culture medium. The expression "effective immunization dosage" is that amount which will induce immunity in an animal against challenge using the infectious agent or that amount which will induce immunity in an animal against a challenge with the infectious agent against which the antigen is directed. Immunity is considered as having been induced in an animal when the level of protection for the animal is significantly higher than that of an unvaccinated control group. [0058] The immunogenic composition of this invention may contain one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Non-limited examples of such carriers include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starch, acacia gum, calcium phosphate, alginate, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl hydroxy benzoate, propyl hydroxy hydroxy benzoate, talc, stearic acid, magnesium, and mineral oils. In addition to the above ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may further comprise lubricants, wetting agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, etc. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and formulations are described in detail in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (19th ed., 1995). [0059] The invention also includes kits containing one or more containers of the immunogenic compositions and/or antigens of the invention. The immunogenic composition can be in liquid form or can be lyophilized; as can be the antigens. Suitable containers for the immunogenic compositions and/or antigens include, for example, bottles, jugs, vials, syringes, and test tubes. Containers can be formed from a variety of materials, including glass or plastic. A container may have a sterile access port (for example, the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The kit can also contain a second container inside of which is a pharmaceutically- acceptable buffer, such as phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution, or dextrose solution. The kit can also contain other materials useful to the end-user, including other pharmaceutically acceptable formulating solutions such as buffers and/or diluents, filters, needles, and syringes or other delivery devices. The kit may optionally include an adjuvant in a container. The kit can also contain written instructions for administering the immunogenic composition and/or antigen and other contents of the kits to subjects. The written instructions may describe methods for inducing an immune reaction or methods for treating infections. The invention also includes a delivery device pre-filled with the immunogenic composition of the invention. [0060] The invention also provides for the immunogenic composition described herein to be used as a medicament. A medicament is preferably able to generate an immune response in an animal. The invention also provides for the use of the immunogenic composition of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for generating an immune response in an animal. In one embodiment, the medicament is a vaccine or an immunostimulatory composition or an immunosuppressant composition. [0061] The invention provides methods for inducing or increasing an immune response using the immunogenic composition. The immune response is preferably protective and can include antibodies and/or cell-mediated immunity (including systemic and mucosal immunity). Immune responses include booster responses. The invention also provides methods for suppressing or decreasing an immune response in the animal to the antigen using an immunogenic composition. Such a suppression of an immune response may be useful if the animal is hypersensitive to the antigen. [0062] As used herein, the terms "subject," "host," "animal" or "individual" typically refer to an avian at risk for acquiring an infection by infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). The terms "subject," "host," or "individual" may be used interchangeably. Suitable avian for the disclosed immunogenic composition, antigens, methods and kits may include poultry, ducks, game birds (including, but not limited to, quail, pheasants, and geese), ratites (including, but not limited to, ostrich) and other domesticated birds and avian pets. The term "poultry" denotes birds of the order Galliformes, such as, for example, ordinary domestic fowl (chicken, turkeys, ducks, etc.) and include the species Gallus gallus and the subspecies Gallus gallus domesticus, Meleagris gallopavo, Meleagris gallopavo , and Meleagris ocellata. [0063] Having described the invention, below are examples illustrating the generation and efficacy of the invention. Example 1 Construction of recombinant LaSota cDNA containing the gB or gD gene of ILTV [0064] The previously generated full-length LaSota cDNA plasmid is used as a backbone (Hu, et al., Vaccine 29:8624-8633 (2011)) for generating the chimeric virus. This plasmid contains a T7 polymerase operably linked to cDNA encoding NDV genes (the reverse complement of NDV genes) followed by the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme gene and T7 terminator sequences. cDNA containing the coding sequence of ILTV gB (SEQ ID NO: 1), which encodes the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO: 2, or the coding sequence of ILTV gD (SEQ ID NO: 3), which encodes the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO: 4, is inserted into the LaSota plasmid between the phosphoprotein (P) and matrix (M) genes as an additional transcription unit using the In-Fusion® PCR cloning kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Primers sets used to amplify the cDNA fragments and the linearized vector backbone are designed to contain a 15-nucleotide (nt) overlapping region of homology at their 5' end (see Table 1). The pfuUlt ™ II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) is used for the PCR amplification of the cDNAs or plasmid, according to the manufacturer's instructions, throughout the cloning process unless otherwise indicated. [0065] The full-length LaSota cDNA plasmid is linearized by PCR amplification with a pair of specific primers (Insert vec up and Insert vec down, Table 2) in the intergenic region between the P and M genes. The open reading frame (ORF) of the ILTV gB or ILTV gD gene flanked with the NDV gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) sequences are amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of ILTV 63140 strain (Spatz, et al., Virus Genes 44:273-285 (2012)) with gene-specific primers (Plant-gB/GFP F and Plant-gB/GFP R for the gB; Plant- gD/GFP F and Plant-gD/GFP R for gD, Table 2). Subsequently the ILTV gB gene or ILTV gD gene ORF fragment is cloned into the linearized LaSota plasmid using the In-Fusion® PCR cloning kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The resulting NDV and ILTV recombinant cDNA plasmids are designated as pLS/ILTV-gB and pLS/ILTV-gD, respectively (see Figure 1). The entire DNA sequence of plasmid pLS/ILTV-gB (see Fig. 1) is in SEQ ID NO: 13. The cDNA sequence of the chimeric virus (rLS/ILTV-gB virus; aka NDV LaSota expressing ILTV gB) is in SEQ ID NO: 14. This cDNA sequence is the reverse complement of the chimeric virus' negative-strand RNA genome (see SEQ ID NO: 15). The entire DNA sequence of plasmid pLS/ILTV-gD (see Fig. 1) is in SEQ ID NO: 16. The cDNA sequence of the chimeric virus (rLS/ILTV-gD virus; aka NDV LaSota expressing ILTV gD) is in SEQ ID NO: 17. This cDNA sequence is the reverse complement of the chimeric virus' negative- strand RNA genome (see SEQ ID NO: 18). Table 2. Primer sequences used in the study Primers 1 to 2 were used to PCR amplify or linearize the pFLC-LaSota vector. b Primers 3 to 4 were used to amplify the cDNA fragments containing the ILTV gB gene ORF. c Primers 5 to 6 were used to amplify the cDNA fragments containing the ILTV gD gene ORF. d Primers 7 to 8 were used to amplify the cDNA fragments containing the GFP gene ORF. Nucleotides shown in lower case letters represent homology sequences with a vector backbone, which were used to facilitate the restriction endonuclease independent cloning using the In-Fusion® PCR cloning kit (Clontech). Example 2 Generation of chimeric viruses (virus rescue and propagation) [0066] Rescue of the recombinant NDV LaSota/ILTV-gB chimeric virus (rLS/ILTV-gB) and the NDV LaSota/ILTV-gD chimeric virus (rLS/ILTV-gD) is performed by transfection of the full-length plasmids (pLS/ILTV-gB and pLS/ILTV-gD, respectively) and supporting plasmids (three plasmids which express the NDV NP, P, and L proteins, respectively, in the transfected cells) into HEp-2 cells as described in Estevez, et al., Virus Research 129(2): 182- 190 (2007) and in Yu, et al., World J. of Vaccines 3: 130-139 (2013). The rescued viruses, which are confirmed by a positive hemagglutination assay (see D. J. Alexander, "Newcastle Disease Virus and Other Avian Paramyxoviruses," pp. 156-163 In: Swayne, et al, (eds.), A Laboratory Manual for the Isolation and Identification of Avian Pathogens, 4th edition, American Association of Avian Pathologists, Kennett Square (1998)) are plaque purified three times in DF-1 cells and finally amplified in SPF chicken embryos three times. The allantoic fluid is harvested, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C as a stock. The complete genomic sequences of the rescued viruses are determined by direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products amplified from the viral genomic RNA as described previously in Hu, et al., Vaccine 29(47):8624-8633 (2011) and are set forth in SEQ ID NO: 15 for rLS/ILTV-gB and SEQ ID NO: for rLS/ILTV-gD. [0067] In addition to the generation of rLS/ILTV-gB chimeric virus and rLS/ILTV-gD chimeric virus, a recombinant NDV LaSota virus containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a control is generated. The open reading frame of the ILTV gB gene in the pLS/ILTV-gB plasmid is replaced with the open reading frame of GFP gene using the In- Fusion® PCR cloning kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) with paired specific primers (Insert vec up and Insert vec down for linearizing the vector, and Plant- GFP F and Plant- GFP R for amplifying the GFP open reading frame from the pAAV-hrGFP plasmid, see Table 2). Subsequently the resulting plasmid, designated as pLS-GFP, is used to rescue the rLS-GFP chimeric virus as described previously (Hu, et al. (2011)). Example 3 Virus titration, pathogenicity, and growth dynamics assays [0068] Analysis of the chimeric viral stock titers, rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gB, are completed using the standard hemagglutination assay test described in Example 2 in a 96- well microplate, the 50% tissue infectious dose (TCID50) assay on DF-1 cells, and the 50% egg infective dose (EID50) assay in 9-day-old SPF chicken embryos and compared to the parental NDV LaSota strain. The TCID50 assay and the EID50 assay are performed using the protocols set forth in Alexander (1998). Pathogenicity of the recombinant viruses is assessed by performing the standard mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) tests and also compared to the parental NDV LaSota strain. See, Alexander (1998) for the protocols for the MDT assay and the ICPI assay. Cytopathic effects (CPE) and growth dynamics of the recombinant viruses are examined in DF- 1 cells and compared to the parental virus as described in Hu, et al. (2011). Example 4 IFA for gB and gD expressed by chimeric viruses [0069] To examine expression of the ILTV-gB or ILTV-gD protein by the recombinant viruses, DF-1 cells are grown in a 12- well plate and are infected with rLS/ILTV-gB, rLS/ILTV-gD (produced above in Examples 1 and 2), or the parental NDV LaSota strain (negative control) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. At 24 hours post-infection, the infected cells are washed three times with lx PBS and fixed with 10% zinc formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) for 15 minutes at room temperature, followed by adding 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to permeabilize the DF-1 cells at room temperature for 10 minutes. The permeabilized DF-1 cells are blocked with 5% goat serum (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) for 30 minutes at 37°C using manufacturer's suggested protocol. After blocking, the DF-1 cells are incubated with chicken anti-ILTV serum (a gift of Dr. Maricarmen Garcia from the University of Georgia, Athens, GA) and/or mouse anti- NDV HN monoclonal antibody (Mab, a gift of Dr. Ron Iorio from University of Massachusetts Medical School, Boston, MA), then with fluorescein (FITC) conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG (H+L) (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) and/or Alexa Fluor® 568 labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 minutes for each incubation at 37 °C according to manufacturers' suggested protocol. The cells are washed three times with lx PBS after each treatment. Finally, the cells are mounted with Fluoromount-G® (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). Fluorescence is examined and digitally photographed using an inverted fluorescence microscope at lOOx magnifications with a matching wavelength filter for FITC or Alexa Fluor® 568 (Nikon, Eclipse Ti, Melville, NY). [0070] The DF-1 cells infected with parental NDV LaSota virus (negative control) fluoresce red when exposed to mouse anti-NDV HN monoclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor® 568 labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, but did not fluoresce when exposed to chicken anti-ILTV serum and FITC-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG. Thus, the parental NDV LaSota virus infected DF-1 cells do not express ILTV gB or gD. DF-1 cells infected with the chimeric virus, rLS/ILTV-gB, fluoresce green when exposed to chicken anti-ILTV serum and FITC- conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG and red when exposed to mouse anti-NDV HN monoclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor® 568 labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. When exposed to both labels, many DF-1 cells fluoresce a combination of red and green. Similarly, DF-1 cells infected with the chimeric virus, rLS/ILTV-gD, fluoresce green when exposed to chicken anti-ILTV serum and FITC-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG and red when exposed to mouse anti-NDV HN monoclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor® 568 labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. When exposed to both labels, many DF-1 fluoresce a combination of red and green. Example 5 Inoculation of Leghorn chickens with immunogenic composition [0071] To evaluate immune response generated by the chimeric viruses (immunogenic compositions) and if any protective immunity is generated against infectious laryngo tracheitis, SPF Leghorn chickens are inoculated with the chimeric viruses (rLS/ILTV- gB or rLS/ILTV-gD). One hundred and five 1 -day-old SPF Leghorn chickens are randomly divided into seven groups of 15 birds. Each bird in group 1 is inoculated with 100 μΐ of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) via intranasal (IN) and eye drop (ED) routes as unvaccinated controls. Birds in groups 2 and 3 are vaccinated with 100 μΐ of rLS-GFP (l.OxlO7 TCID50/ml) per bird via IN/ED routes as NDV LaSota vector controls; birds in groups 4 and 5 are vaccinated with 100 μΐ of rLS/ILTV-gB (l.OxlO7 TCID50/ml) produced per Example 1 and 2 per bird via IN/ED routes; and birds in groups 6 and 7 are vaccinated with 100 μΐ of rLS/ILTV-gD (l.OxlO7 TCID50/ml) produced per Example 1 and 2 per bird via IN/ED routes. At 21 days post-vaccination (DPV), the birds in groups 1, 2, 4 and 6 are challenged with virulent ILTV at a dose of 104 TCIDso/ml per birds (see Fig. 2A). The birds in groups 3, 5, and 7 are challenged with the virulent ILTV at the same dose at 28 DPV (see Fig 2B). Blood samples are collected from each bird immediately before challenge for detection of antibody responses by the hemagglutination inhibition assay (as described above). Tracheal and ocular swabs are collected from each of the birds at 4 days post-challenge (DPC) for detection of ILT virus shedding by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) using the protocol indicated below. [0072] Tracheal swabs are suspended in 1.0 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline containing 2% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 2% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All samples are stored at -20°C until further processed. Total DNA of the clinical samples is purified using the PBS/mucus eluent and the MagaZorb® DNA Mini-Prep Kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in a 96-well format according to the manufacturer's instructions. All buffers used in the DNA purification procedure are supplied with the kit. Briefly, 200 μL· PBS/mucus eluent is transferred to a 96-well plate. 20 μL· Proteinase K solution (20 mg/ml) are added to each suspension and mixed by manual swirling. Cells are lysed with the addition of 200 μL· of Lysis Buffer. The plate is covered with adhesive film and is pulse-vortex mixed until the mixture is homogenous. Samples are incubated for 10 minutes at 56°C. To bind DNA, 500 μL· of Binding Buffer are added to each sample and thoroughly mixed. Next, 20 μL· MagaZorb® Reagent is added. Samples are then incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, with manual mixing every 2 minutes. MagaZorb® particles are pelleted for more than 10 minutes using a magnetic rack (Ambion, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Supernatants are removed by aspiration. Samples are washed twice with 1 mL Wash Buffer. Plates are inverted several times to ensure adequate washing. The particles are again pelleted using a magnetic rack. Supernatants are removed by aspiration, and the particles containing DNA are suspended in 200 μL· of Elution Buffer and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, with manual mixing every 2 minutes. Particles are again pelleted using the magnetic rack. Finally, the supernatant containing the purified DNA is transferred to a fresh 96 well plate and is stored at -20°C until further processed. [0073] qPCR is performed on an Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Sciences, Carlsbad, CA). The multiplex reaction contained specific primers and probes for the detection of the UL44 gene of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (encoding glycoprotein C) and the endogenous control gene (avian a2-collagen gene) (reference). The nucleotide sequences of these primers and probes are in Table 3. The UL44 forward primer and Ui44 reverse primer generate a 103 bp amplicon (SEQ ID NO: 22). The a2-collagen forward primer and a2-collagen reverse primer generates a 96 bp amplicon (SEQ ID NO: 26). Multiplex qPCR reactions are set up in a final volume of 25 μL· as follows: lx Universal TaqMan Master Mix with UNG (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 500 nM of UL44 forward primer, 500 nM of Ui44 reverse primer, 500 nM of a2-collagen forward primer, 500 nM of a2-collagen reverse primer, 100 nM of UL44-FAM-TAMRA probe, 100 nM of a2-collagen- VIC®-TAMRA probe, and 5.0 of DNA template (approximately 10-300 ng). The reaction is carried out in a thermal cyclical program with the following parameters: 50°C for 2 minutes followed by 95°C for 10 minutes; followed by a two-step PCR with 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 seconds and annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 minute. A threshold value of 0.05 is used for evaluation of multiple 96- well plates. Samples with any recorded threshold cycle number (Ct) value are considered positive and samples with no recorded Ct value are considered negative.

Detection of NDV antibody response show that all of the LaSota vector immunized birds, the rLS/ILTV-gB immunized birds, the rLS/ILTV-gD immunized birds, and the rLS- GFP immunized birds seroconvert and became seropositive, whereas the PBS control birds contained no NDV antibodies (see Table 4). This result demonstrates that the immunogenic compositions (the chimeric viruses) induced a comparable antibody response as strong as that of the parental NDV vaccine. Because it is well documented that the ILTV antibody response does not necessarily correlate with the disease protection, the ILTV antibody response is not measured. Table 4 a Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer is expressed as log2 of the mean + standard deviation. [0075] From day 3 DPC, all of the birds in the unvaccinated (inoculated with PBS) and the LaSota vector (rLS-GFP) vaccinated groups display typical disease signs, showing conjunctivitis, depression or dyspnea, which are scored 1-3 depending on the severity of disease signs (see Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). The infected birds show peak clinical signs between 4-6 DPC with 10-20% mortality, and gradually decrease in severity thereafter. In contrast, more than 90% of the rLS/ILTV-gB vaccinated chickens and the rLS/ILTV-gD vaccinated chickens show no disease signs, and only 2-5 birds display very mild clinical signs at 4-7 DPC (see Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B) in the chimeric virus groups. [0076] Detection of the presence of the challenge virus in the tears as measured by the presence of viral DNA show that the chickens immunized with the rLS/ILTV-gB shed significantly less ILT challenge virus; 6-fold reduction in ILTV load (P<0.01) in tears collected 21 days post-immunization, and 37-fold reduction in ILTV load (P<0.01) in tears collected 28 days post-immunization than in the same time samples from birds in the control group (inoculated with rLS-GFP) (see Fig. 3). In tear samples collected 21 and 28 days post- immunization a 16- and 22-fold reduction of ILTV load, respectively (F<0.01) is quantified in chickens innoculated with the rLS/ILTV-gD. This reduction in virus shedding is in agreement with the clinical sign observations. [0077] Detection of the presence of the challenge virus in the tracheal lumen as measured by the presence of viral DNA show that the chickens innoculated with the rLS/ILTV-gB shed significantly less ILT challenge virus, 12-fold reduction in ILTV load (F<0.01) in tears collected 21 days post-immunization and 8.8-fold reduction in ILTV load (F<0.01) in tracheal samples collected 28 days post-inoculation than in the same time samples from birds in control group (inoculated with rLS-GFP ) (see Fig. 3). In tracheal samples collected 21 and 28 days post-inoculation a 3.75- and 2.72-fold reduction of ILTV load, respectively, (F<0.01) is quantified in chickens inoculated with the rLS/ILTV-gD. This reduction in virus shedding is in agreement with the clinical sign observations. Example 6 Chimeric virus expressing ILTV gB v CEO and TCO ILTV vaccines [0078] One hundred and twenty 3-week-old commercial broilers are randomly divided into six groups of 20 birds. Each bird in groups 1-3 is inoculated via IN/ED routes with 100 μΐ of PBS, rLS-GFP (l.OxlO7 TCID50/ml), or rLS/ILTV-gB (l.OxlO7 TCID50/ml), respectively. Birds in groups 4 and 5 are vaccinated with one dose of commercial ILTV vaccine, either chicken embryo origin ILTV vaccine (CEO) or with tissue culture origin ILTV vaccine (TCO), per bird via the eye-drop route. Birds in group 6 are untreated and serve as body- weight gain controls. At 21 DPV, the birds in groups 1-5 are challenged with virulent ILTV in a dose of 104 TCIDso/ml per bird. The serum samples are collected immediately before vaccination and challenge. The tracheal and ocular swab samples are collected at 4 DPC. All serum and swab samples are examined as described in Example 5 above. [0079] After vaccination, all birds appear healthy without any signs of vaccine induced side- effects. Detection of NDV antibody response from the sera collected immediately before challenge show that all of the LaSota vector inoculated birds and rLS/ILTV-gB inoculated birds become NDV seropositive (see Table 5). As expected, the unvaccinated (PBS control), and the ILTV CEO and TCO inoculated birds do not have detectable anti-NDV antibodies (Table 4). Table 5 Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer was expressed as log2 of the mean + standard deviation [0080] From day 3 post challenge, all of the birds in the unvaccinated group (inoculated with PBS) and the LaSota vector (rLS-GFP) vaccinated group display typical signs of disease. The infected birds show peak clinical signs between 4-6 DPC and gradually decrease in severity thereafter (see Fig. 4). There are 50% mortality for birds in the PBS group and 5% mortality in the LaSota vector group, respectively. In contrast, there is only one bird from the rLS/ILTV-gB inoculated broiler group and one from the CEO inoculated broiler group which show any clinical signs at 4-5 DPC. They are scored as very mild clinical signs (see Fig. 4). [0081] Detection of the presence of the challenge virus in the tracheal lumen using the multiplex qPCR protocol described above shows that the chickens vaccinated with the rLS/ILTV-gB shed significant less ILTV (16- fold reduction in ILTV load, P<0.01) than the birds inoculated with rLS-GFP (control group) (see Fig. 5). As expected, the birds vaccinated with the CEO or TCO commercial vaccines also shed significant less ILTV (F<0.01) than the control birds. The level of virus shedding is in accordance with the clinical sign observations. [0082] Detection of the presence of the challenge virus in tears using the multiplex qPCR protocol described above shows that the chickens that received rLS/ILTV-gB shed significant less ILTV, 18-fold reduction in ILTV load (F<0.01), than the birds in control group inoculated with rLS-GFP (see Fig. 5). As expected, the birds vaccinated with the CEO or TCO commercial vaccines also shed significant less ILTV (P<0.01) than the control birds. The level of virus shedding is in accordance with the clinical sign observations. [0083] In addition to causing the typical clinical signs, ILTV infection of broilers will also decrease body- weight gains. As such, the body- weight of the broilers is measured just prior to being challenged (age of 42 days) and at termination of the experiment (age of 51 days) to evaluate the efficacy of the chimeric vaccine to protecting against disease symptoms. The rate of body-weight gains of the birds from the rLS/ILTV-gB inoculated group is similar to that of the birds from the unvaccinated/unchallenged control and the commercial vaccine groups (CEO and TCO ILTV vaccines) (F>0.05), but significantly higher than that from the PBS and LaSota vector groups (F<0.05). See Figure 6. Example 7 Immune response and protection against virulent NDV challenge [0084] To evaluate protective efficacy conferred by the chimeric viruses of the present invention against Newcastle disease, forty-one day-old SPF chickens are randomly divided into four groups of 10 birds. Birds in groups 1-4 are inoculated with 100 μΐ of PBS, the NDV LaSota vaccine, rLS/ILTV-gB (l.OxlO7 TCID50/ml), or rLS/ILTV-gD (l.OxlO7 TCID50/ml), respectively, via IN/ED routes. At 14 DPV, the birds are challenged with a lethal dose of the NDV/CA02 virus. Serum samples are collected immediately before challenge for anti-NDV antibody detection. [0085] As shown in Table 6, all of the chickens inoculated with the NDV LaSota vaccine or the chimeric viruses are completely protected against NDV challenge without showing any signs of disease. In contrast, all of the birds in the unvaccinated control group (inoculated with PBS) display disease signs with conjunctivitis and severe depression from 2 to 4 DPC and 100% mortality at 5 DPC. The HA inhibition assay of the serum samples collected immediately before the challenge showed that immunization of chickens with either the recombinant chimeric viruses or the parental LaSota vaccine induced NDV-specific serum antibody responses and conferred protection against the virulent NDV challenge. Table 6 PBS 0/10 0 0/10 NDV LaSota 10/10 4.8 + 1.4 10/10 rLS/ILTV-gB 10/10 3.4 + 1.3 10/10 rLS/ILTV-gD 10/10 3.8 + 1.2 10/10 Hemagglutination (HA) inhibition titer is expressed as log2 of the mean + standard deviation. Example 8. Protection against ILTV of 3-day-old commercial broiler chickens having NDV maternally derived antibodies [0086] To determine the efficacy of the recombinant chimeric vaccine in chicks having maternal antibodies to NDV, two groups, each containing fifteen 3-day-old commercial broiler chicks with NDV maternally derived antibody (mean HI titer of 7.1 (Log2)), are vaccinated, via IN/ED routes, with one of the two chimeric vaccines— rLS/ILTV-gB (l.OxlO6 EIDso bird) or rLS/ILTV-gD (l.OxlO6 EID50/ml). A third group of fifteen chicks receive rLS/GFP vector control as a control, and a fourth group of fifteen chicks are not vaccinated. At 21 days post-vaccination, all groups are challenged with virulent ILTV (104 TCID5o/ml per bird). A fifth group of fifteen chicks are used as an unvaccinated and non- challenge control for body-weight gain comparison purposes. Prior to challenge, none of the vaccinated birds display side-effects from the chimeric vaccine. At day 21 post- vaccination (24 days of age), the NDV maternal antibody HI titer declines to 1.00 (Log2), but the HI titers in NDV chimeric vaccine groups slightly increased to 1.53-2.00 (Log2). Birds vaccinated with rLS/ILTV-gB or rLS/ILTV-gD are significantly protected against ILTV challenge with less than 30% of the birds showing mild clinical signs, whereas 100% birds in the rLS/GFP vector control and unvaccinated groups display typical clinical signs or died. There is no significant difference in body weight gains between the vaccinated groups and the non- challenge control group of chickens. At 21 days post-vaccination, tracheal and ocular swabs are collected for a real time qPCR assay using primers listed in Table 3 in order to determine the copy number of the chimeric virus in vaccinated birds. Relative to the control group vaccinated with rLS/GFP, a 51.30% and 42.26% reduction in chimeric virus copy numbers in tracheal swabs for rLS/gB and rLS/gD, respectively, could be demonstrated. Likewise there is a 92.6% and 94.8% reduction in chimeric virus copy numbers in ocular swabs for rLS/gB and rLS/gD, respectively relative to the control group vaccinated with rLS/GFP. While maternally derived NDV antibody moderately suppresses the immunoresponse to the NDV vector, the ILTV antigens expressed from the NDV vector are still sufficient to elicit a significant and protective antibody response in vaccinates and provide protection against ILTV clinical disease. Example 9 Safety of recombinant chimeric vaccine in 1-day old chicks [0087] Two groups of twenty SPF 1-day old chicks are vaccinated via IN/ED routes, with one of the two chimeric vaccines, either rLS/ILTV-gB (l.OxlO7 EID50 bird) or rLS/ILTV-gD (l.OxlO7 EID5o/bird) at ten times (10X) the recommended dosage. (A standard dose of NDV vaccine strain La Sota is typically given at l.OxlO6 EIDso/bird (Zoetis, Inc., Florham Park, NJ)). Two additional groups of twenty SPF 1-day old chicks are vaccinated with either of two commercial NDV vaccines (LaSota strain purchased from Merial (Duluth, GA) and Hitchner Bl strain purchased from Zoetis (Florham Park, NJ). A fifth group of twenty chicks are used as an unvaccinated control. At day 3 and 5 post vaccination, five birds from each group euthanized, and eye eyelid, larynx and trachea of the euthanized birds are collected for examination of histropathology changes and virus replication. The remaining birds in each group are observed for clinical signs for two weeks. None of the birds exhibit clinical signs or vaccine side-effects, even those receiving the higher dosage of the chimeric virus. The chimeric vaccines (rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gD) given at lOx recommended dosage cause mild lymphocytic inflammation, epithelial proliferation, and minimal to mild deciliation in vaccinated chicken. However, these histopathology changes are similar to the changes observed in chickens vaccinated with the commercial vaccines administered at the lower lx recommended dosage. Vaccine virus replication is noted in the eyelid, larynx and trachea of vaccinated chickens. In tracheal samples, the titers of the commercial LaSota vaccine and the chimeric vaccines rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gD are approximately a logio higher than those in tracheal samples from chickens vaccinated with the commercial NDV Hitchner Bl vaccine. Thus, the chimeric vaccines, rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gD, are safe to use in day-old SPF chickens and commercial broilers.
