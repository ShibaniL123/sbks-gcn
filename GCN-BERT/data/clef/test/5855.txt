Example 1
5-(2-Fluorophenyl)-3-[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine
Step 1. 5-Chloro-3-iodo-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrimidine
Potassium hydroxide (2.2 g, 39 mmol) and iodine (4.9 g, 19 mmol) were added to a solution of 5-chloro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine (Astatech, 1.5 g, 9.7 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 50° C. for 2 hours. After cooling to r.t., water was added and the reaction was neutralized to pH 7. The mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic phase was washed with brine. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (1 g, 37%).
