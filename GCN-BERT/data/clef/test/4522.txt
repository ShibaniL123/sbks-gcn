FIELD The disclosure relates to transition metal catalysts and the role of these catalysts in mediating hydrodesulfurization reactions of a range of organic compounds with at least one carbon-sulfur bond. More particularly, the disclosure relates to phosphoranimide-transition metal catalysts having a phosphoranimide to metal ratio of 1:1 and a method of hydrodesulfurization of a range of organic compounds including dibenzothiophenes, benzothiophenes, thiophenes, thiols and sulfide ethers. BACKGROUND Transition metal catalysis remains a key enabling technology for the production of fuel. The petroleum upgrading process, particularly hydrotreatment, involves the reductive cleavage of polar bonds such as carbon-sulfur and carbon-nitrogen bonds, processes commonly referred to as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), respectively. The efficient and complete removal of sulfur and nitrogen atoms is desired for the production of environmentally safe fuel because the combustion of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing components of petroleum results in increased emission of gaseous pollutants (SOx and NOx) to the atmosphere. Current hydrotreatment catalyst technologies are energy intensive (R. R. Chianelli et al. Catalysis Today 147 (2009) 275-286). This is due in part to the reaction conditions required for the metal catalysts to function. For example, cobalt- and nickel-promoted catalysts, such as CoMoS2 and NiWS2, generally function at high temperatures and high hydrogen pressures. These heterogeneous catalysts, in some cases, function at temperatures ranging from 300-650° C. and hydrogen pressures ranging from 90 to 120 atm or higher. The range of process conditions varies with catalyst formulation. These high temperature and high pressure conditions add to the refining costs of petroleum and crude oil. Hence, there remains a demand for cost-effective catalyst technologies for petroleum upgrading. Industrial HDS and HDN catalysts generally comprise second- and third-row transition metals such as molybdenum, tungsten and platinum, usually in combination with ruthenium, cobalt or nickel promoters. The utilization of these relatively expensive and rare transition metals further raise barriers for the sustainability of industrial hydrotreatment. Hence, it is desirable to obtain high activity catalysts for HDS and HDN from inexpensive and terrestrially abundant first-row transition metals. First-row transition metal catalysts have traditionally been believed to possess intrinsically low activity. However, results of studies on commercial CoMoS2 catalysts can be interpreted to suggest that the active sites of the catalysts may be the cobalt rather than the molybdenum centers. Examples of these studies are detailed in papers such as (1) Duchet, J. C.; van Oers, E. M.; de Beer, V. H. J.; Prins, R. J. Catal. 1983, 80, 386; (2) Vissers, J. P. R.; de Beer, V. H. J.; Prins, R. J. Chem. Soc. Farady Trans. I. 1987, 83, 2145. These results suggest that catalysts containing transition metals such as cobalt may be useful in catalysis. In particular, late first-row transition metals such as Fe, Co and Ni are relatively inexpensive and abundant, making them good candidates for use in HDS and HDN.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure relates to homogeneous ligand-supported coordination complexes that function as catalysts for HDS reactions. The catalysts of the present disclosure are coordinatively unsaturated. Coordinatively unsaturated catalysts are typically less stable and more reactive than coordinatively saturated catalysts, which make them good candidates for various organic transformations. The catalysts described herein comprise at least one metal having a formal oxidation state of +1 bonded to a monoanionic phosphoranimide ligand, the catalysts typically being in the form of a cluster of metal atoms, with the metal atoms bridged by the nitrogen centers of monoanionic phosphoranimide ligands. The metal atoms that comprise the catalysts are first-row transition metals. The catalysts can function under relatively low temperatures (e.g., about 90 to about 300° C.) and relatively low hydrogen pressures (e.g., about 1 atm to about 100 atm) and can catalyze a range of organic transformations, including HDS. These reaction conditions are milder than the reaction conditions typically required by heterogeneous HDS catalysts. As used herein, the term “mild” is used in reference to temperature conditions lower than about 300° C. and pressure conditions less than about 100 atmospheres. The reaction conditions required for HDS will necessarily vary, being dependent on the catalyst, the substrate and the solvent(s) used, among other factors. It has been observed that the catalysts can function at higher pressures and temperatures than solely the mild conditions just described. Accordingly, in practice, the temperature and pressure range for functionality of the catalysts is quite broad. The catalysts consist of an assembly of monomeric units having the empirical formula: [in-line-formulae][M(NPR3)] Formula I[/in-line-formulae] where: the ratio of M to NPR3 is 1:1; M is a first row transition metal; NPR3 is: where: R1, R2, R3 are independently alkyl (C1-C18, primary, secondary or tertiary alkyl), cycloalkyl (C3-C8), aryl/heteroaryl, substituted aryl/heteroaryl or an inert functional group containing at least one heteroatom and wherein R1, R2, R3 may also be linked by aliphatic groups to give cyclic systems, [(e.g., R1/R2=—(CH2)n—, where n=3-10]. According to one embodiment, the first-row transition metal may be Fe, Co, Ni or Mn. The Examples below describe catalysts having Co, Fe and Ni as the metal centers as being suitable. According to one embodiment, the heteroatoms are Group 14, 15 and 16 elements, preferably Si, N or O. The catalysts of the present disclosure will be referred to, throughout this disclosure, using the following general formula: [in-line-formulae][M(NPR3)]n Formula II[/in-line-formulae] where: n is a whole number; M and NPR3 are as defined above for the compound of Formula I. In one embodiment, the catalyst has formula [M(NPR3)]n where n is a whole number of at least 2. In another embodiment, n is 2 to 8. The [M(NPR3)]n complex can adapt various modes of aggregation to form clusters. As an example, the present disclosure further discloses catalysts having general formula: [in-line-formulae][M(NPR3)]4 Formula III[/in-line-formulae] wherein M, NPR3 are as defined above for the compound of Formula I. As a specific, non-limiting example, the catalysts of Formula III are discrete tetrametallic transition metal clusters having the following structural formula: The metal centers of the catalysts of Formula III are supported by bridging, anionic phosphoranimide ligands. Each tetrametallic cluster consists of four nitrogen-bridged phosphoranimidometal(I) (i.e., the compound of Formula I—MNPR3) monomers. As a person skilled in the art would appreciate, complexes of Formula II can adapt various modes of aggregation. As a result, the compounds of Formula II represents a library of catalysts. Structurally characterized compounds of Formula III comprise a subclass of catalysts of Formula II. Compounds of Formula III result from the aggregation of four monomeric units of Formula I. Catalysts supported with phosphoranimide ligands of similar electronic and steric properties with, for example, tri-t-butylphosphoranimide may adapt a tetrameric structure. However, unless specifically provided in the example, the catalysts of the present disclosure are not limited to one particular characterized structure. Based on the structure of Formula III catalysts, it should be apparent that the phosphoranimide (P═N) functional group displaces R1, R2 and R3 away from the metal center allowing for steric accessibility of the metal center. Thus, the metal center is still active, despite the presence of bulky substituents on the phosphoranimide. Each metal center in the Formula III catalysts may have a coordination number of 2 and an oxidation state of +1. The steric accessibility and low-valent nature of the metal centers result in enhanced activity in reductive transformations such as HDS. As a specific example, in the compounds of Formula I, II, III (discussed above) and IV (discussed below), trialkyl- and triarylphosphoranimides can impart thermal stability depending on the phosphorous substituents. Other substituents can be expected to impart similar stability as well, thus providing a range of catalysts that can be used for the HDS process described herein. DEFINITIONS As used herein, the term “alkyl” includes C1 to C18 straight chain, branched or cyclic alkyl groups such as, but not limited to, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and t-butyl. As used herein, the term “aryl” includes aromatic hydrocarbons as substituents. Aryl groups may have one or more aromatic rings which may be fused or connected by a connecting group or a bond. Specific examples include, but are not limited to phenyl, tolyl, naphthenyl and biphenyl. As used herein, the term “heteroaryl” includes aromatic hydrocarbons which contain at least one heteroatom. Similar to the aryl groups, heteroaryls may have one or more aromatic rings which may be fused or connected by a connecting group or a bond. As used herein, the term “inert functional group” designates heteroatom-bearing hydrocarbyl fragments attached via the heteroatom to aryl and heteroaryl ligand substituents, as defined above, or appended to the terminus of a ligand substituent. The former serve to modulate, electronically and/or sterically, the chemical nature of the phosphoranimide ligand(s), modifying but not impeding catalyst performance. The latter can function as a point of further chemical attachment(s) (i.e., derivatization), for example, in order to construct supported heterogeneous catalysts comprising chemically bonded or linked phosphoranimidometal catalyst subunits grafted onto conventional catalyst supports. As used herein, the term “heteroatom” is a Group 14, 15 or 16 element. As used herein, the term “derivative” is a functionalized version of a sulfur-containing substrate where the substituent R's are not all hydrogen. As used herein, the term “pseudohalide” refers to anions with similar properties to halides preferably OSO2R−, where R=Me, Ph, p-Tol, CF3. Reaction Chemistry The process of using the catalysts of the present disclosure involves contacting a sulfur-containing substrate with a metal catalyst of general Formula II (i.e. [M(NPR3)]n), as defined above, in the presence of a reducing agent to effect the reductive cleavage of the carbon-sulfur bond(s) in the substrate. In this process, the catalyst breaks the carbon-sulfur bond(s), replacing the sulfur with hydrogen by the action of the reducing agent (vide infra, hydrogen or silane). The sulfur atoms and/or sulfur-containing groups remain with the catalyst. The reducing agent also acts to convert the catalyst-bound sulfur into a reduced form (vide infra, hydrogen sulfide or an alkanethiol or an aromatic thiol). The products of the HDS process are hydrocarbons and/or incompletely desulfurized compounds, such as alkyl and aromatic thiols. In one example, aromatic hydrocarbons or a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic thiols can be produced from the catalytic HDS of diaryl sulfides. In another example, dibenzothiophene and alkyl-substituted dibenzothiophenes can be hydrodesulfurized into the corresponding biphenyl compound or a mixture of biphenyl and thiobiphenyl compounds. The generalized reaction scheme (General Reaction 1) is shown below: where: R—S—R is an organic substrate with at least one carbon-sulfur bond; [M(NPR3)]n is a catalyst of Formula II as defined above; [H] is a chemical reducing agent; R—H is a completely hydrodesulfurized product; and R—SH is a partially hydrodesulfurized product. General Reaction 1 is a general reaction equation for the HDS reaction catalyzed by catalysts disclosed herein, showing all possible products that can be obtained from the HDS process using the catalysts disclosed herein. It is noted that the process can produce (1) hydrocarbons (R—H) or (2) partially-desulfurized products (R—SH) or a mixture of hydrocarbons and partially desulfurized products. The present disclosure further describes a process for HDS wherein a stoichiometric amount of a basic salt is added to scavenge hydrogen sulfide and/or thiols produced during the reaction. The following general reaction (“General Reaction 2”) describes this process: where: R—S—R is an organic substrate with at least one carbon-sulfur bond; [M(NPR3)]n is a catalyst of Formula II as defined above; [H] is a chemical reducing agent; M′B is a basic salt to scavenge H2S; M′aSb is a sulfide salt formed from H2S scavenging, wherein a can be 1 or 2; b can be 1 or 2; M′SR is a salt of the partially hydrodesulfurized product; and R—H is the completely hydrodesulfurized product. All catalyst loadings where the catalyst to substrate ratio is less than 1:1 can be used for catalytic HDS. Generally, the ratio of substrate to catalyst can be much greater than 1000:1 to 1:1, the catalyst being stable under a range of conditions. The catalyst loadings detailed in the Examples, range from about 1:130 to 1:15. In some cases, the ratio of substrate to catalyst may be 1:4 to 1:200. Suitable catalyst-to-substrate ratios will be dependent on the specific catalyst, concentration, reaction time, and feedstock, among other factors, and can be determined by a person skilled in the art. The HDS reactions described above as General Reactions 1 and 2 may be carried out, optionally, in an inert organic solvent. By “inert”, it is meant that the solvent does not react with or deactivate the catalyst or interfere in the HDS process. For example, halogenated solvents such as, but not limited to, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) should generally be avoided. Solvents such as toluene, xylene, decaline, methylnaphthalene or tetrahydrofuran (THF) have been used for certain examples. Toluene and THF have been generally used in the examples described herein. In some embodiments, where the sulfur-containing organic substrate is a liquid or low-melting solid, for example, an organic solvent may not be needed in the reaction. Reactions may also be run under triphasic conditions, also called the slurry phase, where some of the substrate, some of the catalyst, or some of each component are not completely dissolved in the selected solvent. The choice of solvent will vary with the properties of the substrate(s) under reduction. The chemical reducing agent can be hydrogen (H2) or an organic silyl hydride. When the reducing agent is an organic silyl hydride, the silyl hydride may be chosen from the group of phenylsilane, dimethylphenylsilane and ethylsilane, for example. When hydrogen gas is used as the reducing agent, pressures of 1 atm or higher are typically employed. The reductant is used in an amount sufficient to effectuate the desired level of HDS, which is generally complete HDS. In the case of hydrogen, reactions are routinely run in the presence of an excess of the reductant, or under conditions of constant hydrogen pressure, wherein the reductant is dissolved in the medium is replenished as it is consumed, optimally maintaining a solution saturated in the reductant. In the case of silane, an excess is generally used and no basic scavenger is added to the reduction medium: the silane reacts with the thiol intermediates and any H2S byproduct formed during the reaction to form silylthioethers and remove the acidic sulfur compounds as they are formed. In addition, the reaction can be carried out at temperatures ranging from about 90 to about 300° C., or greater. The optimal temperature for the reaction will vary depending on the reactor design, reaction scale, solvent(s), reaction time and chemical feedstock. Based on this disclosure, the optimum reaction temperature for a particular reaction can be determined by those skilled in the art. The catalysts tolerate a broad range of reaction temperatures above the low-temperature threshold for conversion. The temperature and pressure conditions described herein are milder than those typically employed in industrial HDS. Accordingly, these catalysts have potential use in industrial processes such as the catalytic HDS of petroleum feedstocks. The ratio of the basic metal salts to the sulfur-containing substrate can be greater than 2:1. The examples provided in this disclosure range from 2:1 to 4:1. The basic metal salts used to scavenge H2S can be selected from the group consisting of Group I and Group II metal hydrides, but are not limited to these groups. For example, Group I metal hydrides may be LiH, NaH, KH or CsH. Group II metal hydrides can be selected from MgH2 and CaH2. The use of metal hydride scavengers is suitable because the reaction between hydride anions and H2S to produce H2 gas is irreversible. In addition, the basic metal salts employed in the process can be selected from the group consisting of Group I and Group II salts of strong organic bases, preferably with pKa higher than 20, but are not limited to these organic bases. For example, basic Group I and II salts may be amide salts such as lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA), potassium diisopropylamide (KDA), or Grignard reagents (alkyl or aryl magnesium halides). Purified Catalyst In one aspect, the process includes the HDS of a range of sulfur-containing organic substrates containing at least one carbon-sulfur bond by introducing a “purified” catalyst of Formula II (i.e. [MNPR3]n). By “purified”, it is meant that the catalyst is subjected to purification methods prior to use for catalytic hydrodesulfurization, as described in the examples provided. The purity may be determined via elemental analysis, for example. To carry out this process, the purified catalysts of Formula II are contacted with an organic substrate having at least one carbon-sulfur bond in the presence of a reducing agent. The reducing agent reacts with the sulfur-containing substrate, converting the carbon-sulfur bonds to carbon-hydrogen bonds. Hydrocarbons or partially desulfurized products (e.g. thiols) or a mixture of hydrocarbons and partially desulfurized products are produced. The process can be carried out using the reaction conditions as described above for General Reactions 1 and 2. In Situ Prepared Catalyst Another aspect of the present disclosure relates to the use of an in situ-prepared (or in situ-derived) catalyst in HDS reactions. By “in situ”, it is meant that the catalyst is not subject to purification after synthesis. In this embodiment, the catalyst of Formula II [M(NPR3)]n is synthesized in situ and used for HDS directly, without isolation or purification. The in situ-derived catalyst is thus produced through the reduction (using an organic silyl hydride or other reducing agents as defined above for General Reaction I and II) of metal-phosphoranimide complexes. The metal-phosphoranimde complexes used as precursors have the general formula shown below. [in-line-formulae][M(NPR3)X(m-1)]n Formula IV[/in-line-formulae] where: m=2 or 3; n=2 to 4; the M to R3PN− ratio is 1:1; M is a first row transition metal; X− can be any halide or pseudohalide; R1, R2, R3 can be the same group or different groups; R1, R2, R3=alkyl (C1-C18, primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl), cycloalkyl (C3-C8), aryl/heteroaryl, substituted aryl/heteroaryl or an inert functional group optionally containing at least one heteroatom; and R1, R2, R3 substituents may also be linked by aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups to give cyclic systems [(e.g., R1/R2=—(CH2)n—, where n=3-10]. In one embodiment, the first row transition metal may be Co, Ni, Mn or Fe. In the Examples, Co, Ni and Fe have been found to be suitable. In one embodiment, the halide may be F−, Cl−, Br−, or I−, and the term “pseudohalide” refers to anions with similar properties to halides preferably OSO2R−, where R=Me, Ph, p-Tol, CF3. The present disclosure provides a method for the in situ synthesis of the metal complexes of Formula II (i.e. [M(NPR3)]n) through the reduction of halide-containing metal phosphoranimide complexes of Formula IV: [MNPR3X(m-1)]n. The in-situ preparation of the catalyst of Formula II is carried out by treating a complex of Formula IV with an appropriate amount of a chemical reducing agent. The synthesis of this in situ-derived catalyst is conducted as shown below: where: [M(NPR3)X(m-1)]n is a halide-functionalized metal-phosphoranimide complex of Formula IV as defined above; [H] is a reducing agent; [M(NPR3)]n is the metal-phosphoranimide catalyst of Formula II as defined above. “Chemical reducing agents” are reagents used in two classes of reactions described herein: (1) The chemical reducing agents required to effect the desulfurization of sulfur-containing substrates include hydrogen (H2) or an organic silyl hydride; (2) the chemical reducing agents used for the in situ-synthesis of the catalyst of Formula II (i.e. [M(NPR3)]n) may be a metal such as but not limited to, Li, Na, or K. It should also be apparent to a person skilled in the art that metal reducing agents may exist in various compounded forms such as, but not limited to, sodium naphthalenide, Na(Hg) amalgam, Na—K alloy, or KC8. The reduction step can be carried out in inert organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, hexane, benzene, diethyl ether or toluene, for example. However, halogen-containing solvents, such as CH2Cl2, for example, are generally unsuccessful in this reduction step. The ratio of the reducing agent to the total amount of M in the complex of Formula IV [M(NPR3)X(m-1)]n may vary depending on the reducing agent. For example, when the reducing agent is Na(Hg) amalgam, the ratio of the reducing agent to complex with Formula III can range from, but not limited to, about 1:1 to 2:1. Ratios higher than of this can be also used for the reduction, but are not necessary. The reduction may be carried out in solvents selected from, but not limited to, tetrahydrofuran, dialkyl ethers, toluene and saturated hydrocarbons such as pentane and hexane. The reduction step can be conducted at low to ambient temperatures. By “low”, it is meant temperatures below about 0° C. and by “ambient”, it is meant about normal room temperature. The preferred temperature for the reduction step varies with the complex of Formula IV, the solvent used the concentrations of the various components, and the choice of reducing agent. A person skilled in the art would be able to determine the appropriate reaction temperature. For example, temperatures may range from about −80 to 25° C., when the reaction is carried out in an inert organic solvent. As a specific but non-limiting example, the reduction of [Cl2Co2(μ-NPtBu3)2(THF)2] using 1% Na(Hg) amalgam, producing [Co(NPtBu3)]4, may be carried out at about −35° C. The solution from the reduction process, containing the in situ-derived catalyst, [MNPR3]n, is directly used for HDS without carrying out the purification procedures described in the synthesis of thoroughly characterized and purified catalyst of Formula II (i.e. [MNPR3]n) and in the synthesis of the unit of Formula I (i.e. [MNPR3]) The in situ-derived or unpurified catalyst desulfurizes organic substrates with at least one carbon-sulfur bond under the same reaction conditions described for General Reactions 1 and II using the purified catalyst of Formula II (i.e. [MNPR3]n). The process pertains to contacting an organic molecule with at least one carbon-sulfur bond with the in situ-derived catalyst in the presence of a reducing agent to cause the reducing agent to react with the sulfur-containing substrate, converting all or some of the carbon-sulfur bonds to carbon-hydrogen bonds, to produce hydrocarbons or a mixture of hydrocarbons and partially desulfurized products. The process can be conducted optionally in the presence of an inert organic solvent as described above using “purified catalysts” for HDS. In another aspect, there is disclosed a method for the synthesis of the in-situ-derived catalyst of Formula II (i.e. [M(NPR3)]n) from an anionic metathesis reaction between a metal halide (MXm) and an alkali or alkaline metal salt of a phosphoranimide ligand, followed directly by the reduction of this intermediate, as described above. The metal precursor can be a metal salt such as MXm or a solvated metal salt such as LaMXm. This reaction is as illustrated below: [in-line-formulae]MXm+M′(NPR3)b→[M(NPR3)X(m-1)]n [/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]LaMXm+M′(NPR3)b→[M(NPR3)X(m-1)]n [/in-line-formulae] where: M′(NPR3)b is a Group I or Group II metal phosphoranimide salt and wherein the anionic phosphoranimide R3PN— ligand is as defined above; m=2 to 3; n=1 to 4; a=1 to 3; b=1 or 3; M to R3PN− ratio in the complex of formula [M(NPR3)X(m-1)]n is 1:1; M can be any first row transition metals such as, but not limited to, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni. X− can be any halide or pseudohalide; L can be a two-electron dative donor molecule selected from the group of dialkyl ethers such as, but not limited to, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, dioxane; or selected from the group of trialkylphosphine or a triarylphosphine such as, but not limited to triphenylphosphine or tri-(p-tolyl)phosphine; M′ can be an alkali or alkaline metal. Alkali phosphoranimide salts (i.e. M′(NPR3)b) employed in the synthesis can include monophosphoranimide salts of lithium, sodium, potassium, and cesium; and alkaline earth metal phosphoranimide salts can include [Mg(NPR3)2] and [Mg(NPR3)X]. The halide may be F−, Cl−, Br−, I− and the pseudohalide may be OSO2R− (R=Me, Ph, p-Tol, CF3), for example. In general, the synthesis of complexes of general Formula IV [M(NPR3)X(m-1)]n can be efficiently carried out using M to R3PN− ratio of about 1:1 or greater. The suitable ratio of the metal salt to M′(NPR3)b varies with the specific metal, leaving group (X) and M′(NPR3)b reagent. When b=1 or when a [Mg(NPR3)X] reagent is used, the ratio of the metal salt to M′(NPR3)b used for this synthesis can be about 1:1; however, yields are generally higher in the presence of an excess of the metal salt, for example, at a ratio of 2:1. When b=2, the excess of metal salt is maintained in the range from 2:1 to 4:1 to ensure that the M to R3PN− ratio is about 1:1 or greater. The anionic metathesis can be conducted in low to ambient temperatures. For example, temperatures may range from about −80 to 25° C. when the reaction is carried out in an inert organic solvent. The anionic metathesis reaction is suitably conducted at temperature ranging from about −75 to −35° C., as demonstrated in the synthesis of [Co(NPtBu3)]4 and [Ni(NPtBu3)]4, described in the Examples. Substrates for HDS The catalysts of Formula II and III of the present disclosure, whether purified or in situ-derived, can be used for the HDS of a range of organic substrates having at least one carbon-sulfur bond. The present disclosure exemplifies substrates that model the sulfur-containing functionality and structural types typically found in petroleum feedstocks. The classes of sulfur-containing substrates known present in petroleum include thiophene derivatives, thiols, sulfide ethers, disulfide ethers, among others. HDS of these compounds is important to address issues relating to the environmental impact of SOx emission and the economical production of environmentally safe (ultra-low sulfur or sulfur-free) fuels. As a person skilled in the art would appreciate, the class of organic sulfur-containing substrates that can be reductively desulfurized using the catalysts described herein is very broad. The substituents present on the substrates can be aliphatic, aromatic, unsaturated, contain heteroatoms, be cyclic or linear, possess functional groups, or contain a combination of these features. The common feature underlying these substrates is that they contain at least one carbon-sulfur bond, and the common underlying transformation is that the carbon-sulfur bond is transformed into a carbon-hydrogen bond. The present disclosure exemplifies the desulfurization of different classes of sulfur-containing organic substrates. Accordingly, as will be discussed below, these catalysts can be used for the HDS of dibenzothiophene and its derivatives. Derivatives are compounds containing the named ring system or subunit but having one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced (substituted) by a non-hydrogen element. Dibenzothiophene and its derivatives constitute the most refractory sulfur-containing components of petroleum. By refractory, it is meant that these substrates are resistant to catalytic processing due to the strength of the carbon-sulfur bonds and steric inaccessibility of the sulfur-functional group. An aspect relates to the HDS of dibenzothiophene and dibenzothiophene derivatives. The reaction conditions employed in this process are similar to those described above for General Reaction 1 in relation to the catalyst of Formula II (i.e. [MNPR3]n,). The sulfur-containing substrate can be represented by the following formula: where: R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 can be the same group or different groups; R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 can be hydrogen, alkyl (C1-C18, primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl), cycloalkyl (C3-C8), aryl/heteroaryl, substituted aryl/heteroaryl or a functional group optionally containing at least one heteroatom; any two vicinal R groups may also be linked to give cyclic systems, both aliphatic and aromatic [(e.g., R1/R2=—(CH2)n—, where n=3-10]; and the term “heteroatom” refers to Group 15 and 16 elements, such as N, S and O. As noted, suitable temperatures and pressures will vary as a function of the solvent used, the concentration of the components, the substrate, and the catalyst, among other factors. Similarly, the solvent will vary depending on the structure and properties (i.e., solubility) of the substrate, but can be determined by a person skilled in the art. The present disclosure present Examples wherein dibenzothiophene and substituted dibenzothiophenes are stoichiometrically or catalytically hydrodesulfurized. The catalysts of the present disclosure also desulfurize thiophene and thiophene derivatives. The reaction conditions employed in this process are similar to those described for General Reactions 1 and 2 above. The substrate can be represented by the general formula: where: R1, R2, R3, R4 can be the same group or different groups; R1, R2, R3, R4 can be alkyl (C1-C18, primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl), cycloalkyl (C3-C8), aryl/heteroaryl, substituted aryl/heteroaryl or a functional group optionally containing at least one heteroatom; any two vicinal R groups may also be linked to give cyclic systems, both aliphatic and aromatic [(e.g., R1/R2=—(CH2)n—, where n=3-10] the term “heteroatom” refers to Group 15 and 16 elements, such as N, S and O. The catalysts of the present disclosure also desulfurize benzothiophene and benzothiophene derivatives.

The substrate can be represented by the general formula: where: R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 can be the same group or different groups; R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 can be hydrogen, alkyl (C1-C18, primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl), cycloalkyl (C3-C8), aryl/heteroaryl, substituted aryl/heteroaryl or a functional group optionally containing at least one heteroatom; any two vicinal R groups may also be linked to give cyclic systems, both aliphatic and aromatic [(e.g., R1/R2=—(CH2)n—, where n=3-10]; and the term “heteroatom” refers to Group 15 and 16 elements, such as N, S and O. In another embodiment, the catalysts also desulfurize sulfide ethers into hydrocarbons and/or thiols. The reaction conditions employed in this process are similar to those described above for General Reactions 1 and 2. The substrate can be represented by the general formula: where: R1, R2 can be the same group or different groups; R1, R2 can be alkyl (C1-C18, primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl), cycloalkyl (C3-C8), aryl/heteroaryl, substituted aryl/heteroaryl or a functional group optionally containing at least one heteroatom; and R1 and R2 may also be linked to give cyclic systems, both aliphatic and aromatic [(e.g., R1/R2=—(CH2)n—, where n=3-10]; and the term “heteroatom” are Group 15 and 16 elements, such as N, S and O. In a specific example, diphenyl sulfide can be desulfurized into a benzene and thiophenol. Prolonged reaction times result in a higher benzene to thiophenol ratio, suggesting that thiophenol, a substrate containing only one carbon-sulfur bond, is desulfurized to produce benzene under the reaction conditions described in this disclosure.

The examples described in this disclosure include substrates of varying steric and electronic properties. In certain substrate classes, the specific substrates chosen represent the most sterically accessible and sterically hindered carbon-sulfur bonds; substrates incorporating sterically hindered carbon-sulfur bonds are not typically known to be desulfurized by homogeneous transition metal catalysts. It should be apparent to a person skilled in the art that substrates containing carbon-sulfur bonds with steric accessibility intermediate to the provided range of examples can be desulfurized by the catalysts described herein. Furthermore, various substituents and degree of substitution are disclosed to illustrate, though not intended to limit, the variations in the electronic properties of the substrates that can be desulfurized by the catalysts described herein. The substituents presented as examples include some of the functional groups known present in sulfur-containing components of petroleum such as, but not limited to, alkyl, aromatic, heteroaromatic and alkoxy groups. The invention is further described in the following specific examples for illustrative purposes only. EXAMPLES In these examples, the following terms are used: Ar—H=the completely desulfurized organic product from hydrodesulfurization. Ar—SH=the product of the first C—S bond scission. STOIC=“Stoichiometric conversion” refers to experiments wherein no catalytic conversion for hydrodesulfurization was observed. Example 1 Synthesis of [Ni(NPtBu3)]4 A nickel phosphoranimide catalyst having the formula shown below is synthesized as an example: To prepare this catalyst (also referred to as the “Ni(I) catalyst”), 1.62 mmol of (dme)NiBr2 and 0.81 mmol LiNPtBu3 are separately suspended in 5 mL portions of tetrahydrofuran (THF) in 15 mL screw-capped vials under an inert atmosphere, for example, in a nitrogen- or argon-filled drybox. Both suspensions are cooled to −35° C. in a dry-box freezer for an hour. The LiNPtBu3 suspension is added drop-wise into the metal halide suspension with occasional stirring over a four-hour period with the temperature constant at −35° C. After the addition of the ligand, the reaction mixture is left in the freezer overnight. The solvent is removed in vacuo and the residue is washed with 4 mL portions of hexane thrice. The residue is dissolved in 7 mL THF, charged with 2.5 mmol of Na delivered using a 1% Na/Hg reagent and stirred overnight. The solvent is evaporated and the product is extracted with pentane and filtered through a plug of Celite. The solvent is removed. This reaction gave an 80% yield. The product precipitates as dark green prismatic crystals from a concentrated THF solution upon cooling to −35° C. The product is characterized by X-ray crystallography, magnetic susceptibility measurement by the Evan's method (Evans, D. F. J. J. Chem. Soc. 1959, 2003-2005, which is herein incorporated by reference) and elemental analysis (vide infra). The calculated elemental composition of the Ni(I) catalyst is C, 52.41%; H, 9.90%; N, 5.09%. The determined elemental composition is C, 52.38%; H, 9.89%; N, 4.96%. Solution magnetic susceptibility experiments revealed that the Ni(I) catalyst is a 3.50-electron paramagnet (μeff=4.40μBo) at room temperature. Example 2 Synthesis of [Co(NPtBu3)]4 A cobalt phosphoranimide catalyst (also referred to herein as the “Co(I) catalyst”) having the formula shown below is synthesized as an example: To prepare this catalyst, 1.62 mmol of CoCl2 and 0.81 mmol LiNPtBu3 are separately suspended in 5 mL portions of tetrahydrofuran (THF) in 15 mL screw-capped vials under an inert atmosphere, for example, in a nitrogen- or argon-filled drybox. Both suspensions are cooled to −35° C. in a dry-box freezer for an hour. The LiNPtBu3 suspension is added drop-wise into the metal halide suspension with occasional stirring over a four-hour period with the temperature constant at −35° C. After the addition of the ligand, the reaction mixture is left in the freezer overnight. The solvent is removed in vacuo and the residue is washed with 4 mL portions of hexane thrice. The residue is dissolved in 7 mL THF, charged with 2.5 mmol of Na delivered using a 1% Na/Hg reagent and stirred overnight. The solvent is evaporated and the product is extracted with pentane and filtered through a plug of Celite. The solvent is removed. This reaction gave a 65% yield. The product precipitates as prismatic dark brown crystals upon cooling to −35° C. The product is characterized by X-ray crystallography, magnetic susceptibility measurement by the Evan's method. The calculated elemental composition is C, 52.36%; H, 9.89%; N, 5.09%. The determined elemental composition is C, 52.68%; H, 10.09%; N, 4.86%. The solution magnetic susceptibility experiments revealed that the Co(I) catalyst is an 8-electron paramagnet (μeff=8.98μBo) at room temperature. Example 3 Synthesis of [Co(NPtBu3)]a from [Cl2Co2(μ-NPtBu3)2(THF)2] All manipulations in this synthesis were carried out under inert atmosphere, for example, in a nitrogen- or argon-filled drybox. 0.5 mmol of [Cl2Co2(μ-NP-tBu3)2(THF)2] is dissolved in 5 mL THF and then treated with 1.1 mmol Na(Hg) reagent at −35° C. to room temperature 12 hours. The solvent is evaporated and the product is extracted with pentane and filtered through a plug of Celite. The solvent is removed and a concentrated THF solution of the product is prepared for recrystallization. The product crystallizes as prismatic dark blue crystals upon cooling to −35° C. The product was identical in all respects to the cobalt(I) catalyst described above in Example 2. Example 4 Synthesis of [Fe(NPtBu3)]n An iron phosphoranimide catalyst having the formula [Fe(NPtBu3)]n was synthesized. To prepare this catalyst, 1.62 mmol of (dme)FeBr2 and 0.81 mmol LiNPtBu3 are separately suspended in 5 mL portions of tetrahydrofuran (THF) in 15 mL screw-capped vials under an inert atmosphere, for example, in a nitrogen- or argon-filled drybox. Both suspensions are cooled to −35° C. in a dry-box freezer for an hour. The LiNPtBu3 suspension is added drop-wise into the metal halide suspension with occasional stirring over a four-hour period with the temperature constant at −35° C. After the addition of the ligand, the reaction mixture is left in the freezer overnight. The solvent is removed in vacuo and the residue is washed with 4 mL portions of hexane thrice. The residue is dissolved in 7 mL THF, charged with 2.5 mmol of Na delivered using a 1% Na/Hg reagent and stirred overnight. The solvent is evaporated and the product is extracted with pentane and filtered through a plug of Celite. The solvent is removed. This reaction forms an amorphous dark brown solid in 50% yield. Example 5 Hydrodesulfurization of Dibenzothiophene in the Absence of a Basic Scavenger The preparation of reaction mixtures is conducted under an inert atmosphere, for example, in a nitrogen-filled dry box. 50 mg (0.27 mmol) DBT and 20 mg (0.018 mmol) of the catalyst [Ni(NPtBu3)]4 (or [Co(NPtBu3)]4) are dissolved in 6 mL toluene. The solution is transferred into a Teflon-sealed glass reactor equipped with a Teflon-sealed magnetic stir bar. The reactor was taken out of the dry box and connected to a hydrogen manifold. The reaction vessel is then charged with H2 (1 atm), employing rigorous inert-atmosphere laboratory techniques. The reaction mixture is then stirred at 1200 rotations per minute (rpm) for 12 hours in an oil bath at 120° C. The reactor is cooled to room and quenched with a 10% HCl solution. The organic products are extracted through diethyl ether-water extractions using three 4 mL portions of diethyl ether. The diethyl ether fractions are pooled, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered through a small column of Florisil. The diethyl ether is removed in vacuo and the residue is dissolved in CDCl3 for 1H-NMR and GC-MS analyses. Table 1 shows results of the reactions carried out using [Ni(NPtBu3)]4 and [Co(NPtBu3)]4.

The reactor was taken out of the dry box and connected to a hydrogen manifold. The reaction vessel is then charged with H2 (1 atm), employing rigorous inert-atmosphere laboratory techniques. The reaction mixture is then stirred at 1200 rpm for 16 hours in an oil bath at 120° C. The reactor is cooled to room and the reaction mixture quenched with a 10% HCl solution. The organic products are extracted through diethyl ether-water extractions using three 4 mL portions of diethyl ether. The diethyl ether fractions are pooled, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered through a small column of Florisil. The diethyl ether is removed in vacuo and the residue is weighed and dissolved in CDCl3 for 1H-NMR and GC-MS analyses. A 20% conversion of the substrate to biphenyl, the exclusive product, was observed in this example. Example 8 Hydrodesulfurization of Dibenzothiophene in the Presence of Metal Hydrides The preparation of reaction mixtures is conducted under an inert atmosphere, for example, in an Argon dry box. A Teflon-sealed reactor, equipped with a Teflon magnetic stir bar, is charged with 100 mg (0.54 mmol) DBT, 10 mg (0.009 mmol) [Ni(NPtBu3)]4, 27 mg (1.12 mmol) NaH (or, in a separate reaction, 46 mg (1.12 mmol) KH) and 6 mL toluene.

The preparation of reaction mixtures is conducted under an inert atmosphere, for example, in an Argon or nitrogen drybox. The desired amount of substrate, catalyst and basic scavenger, as indicated in Table 3, are mixed in toluene (5 to 10 mL). The mixture is transferred into the appropriate pressure reactor equipped with a Teflon magnetic stir bar. Hydrodesulfurization reaction examples run under hydrogen pressures lower than 2 atm are carried out in medium-walled glass pressure reactors, while processes employing pressures higher than 2 atm are contained in a glass-lined steel autoclave. The reaction vessels are charged with H2, employing strict inert-atmosphere laboratory techniques, and heated to the desired temperature in an oil bath on a heating magnetic stir plate, stirring at 1200 rpm. After the desired reaction time, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and then quenched with a 10% HCl solution. The organic products are extracted through a series of diethyl ether-water extractions and the organic fractions are pooled, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered through a small column of Florisil. The solvent is removed in vacuo and the weighed residue is dissolved in CDCl3 for 1H-NMR and GC-MS analyses. The percentage recovery (yield) of HDS products is determined by conducting experiments that have been allowed to proceed to completion. Hydrogen pressures and temperatures employed in these reactions can vary over considerable range, which would be apparent to a person skilled in the art, based upon the teachings of this disclosure and the common general knowledge in the field of chemical catalysis. Table 3 shows some examples of [Ni(NPtBu3)]4-catalyzed dibenzothiophene HDS and the corresponding process conditions employed. The examples are conducted using the general HDS procedure described in Example 9. Examples that proceeded to completion, exemplified by entries 1 to 3, gave isolated ranging from 95 to 97%.

Example 10 Hydrodesulfurization of 4,6-diethyldibenzothiophene The preparation of reaction mixtures is conducted under an inert atmosphere, for example, in an Argon dry box. A Teflon-sealed reactor, is charged with the amounts of substrate, catalyst, basic scavenger (indicated in Table 5), magnetic stir bar, and toluene (5 to 10 mL). The reactor is taken out of the dry box and connected to a hydrogen manifold. The reaction vessel is then charged with H2 (1 atm), employing strict inert-atmosphere laboratory techniques. The reaction mixture is stirred at a rate of 1200 rpm in an oil bath at 120° C. The reactor is cooled to room and quenched with a 10% HCl solution. The organic products are extracted through diethyl ether-water extractions using three 4 mL portions of diethyl ether. The diethyl ether fractions are pooled, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered through a small column of Florisil. The diethyl ether is removed in vacuo, the residue weighed, and then dissolved in CDCl3 for 1H-NMR and GC-MS analyses. Examples of the HDS of 4,6-diethyldibenzothiophene catalyzed by [Ni(NPtBu3)]4 and [Co(NPtBu3)]4 are presented in Table 5. With the sterically hindered thiophene core, the desulfurization of 4,6-diethyldibenzothiophene was observed to be slower than the HDS of dibenzothiophene. These results show that despite the use of the sterically large tri(tert-butyl)phosphoranimide ligand, the Ni(I) and Co(I) catalysts are capable of accessing and desulfurizing sterically hindered sulfur centres: both catalysts mediate HDS of 4,6-diethyldibenzothiophene under similarly mild reaction conditions, producing 3,32-diethylbiphenyl, accompanied by the incompletely converted thiol, 3,32-diethyl-2-thiobiphenyl.

The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at 1200 rpm for 16 hours in an oil bath at 120° C. The reactor is cooled to −35° C. and the reaction mixture quenched with a 10% HCl solution. The temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at −35° C. and a fraction of the organic layer is extracted and submitted for GC-MS analysis. Results of the GC-MS analysis show the presence of a single HDS product component with the GC retention time and EIMS M+ peak corresponding to the molar mass of the hydrocarbon 2-butene (C4H8). Example 12 Hydrodesulfurization of 2-phenyl-3,5-dimethylthiophene The preparation of reaction mixtures is conducted under an inert atmosphere, for example, in an Argon dry box.

The reactor is then taken out of the dry box and connected to a hydrogen manifold. The reaction vessel is then charged with H2 (1 atm), employing strict inert-atmosphere laboratory techniques. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at 1200 rpm for 16 hours in an oil bath at 120° C. The reactor is cooled to room and the reaction mixture quenched with a 10% HCl solution. The organic products are extracted through diethyl ether-water extractions using three 4 mL portions of diethyl ether. The diethyl ether fractions are pooled, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered through a small column of Florisil. The diethyl ether is removed in vacuo and, after weighing, the residue is dissolved in CDCl3 for 1H-NMR and GC-MS analyses. The GC-MS analysis reveals the presence, exclusively, of product components with GC retention times and EIMS M+ values corresponding to HDS products of chemical formula: C12H14 and C12H16 in 3% and 23% yields, respectively. Example 13 Hydrodesulfurization of Benzothiophene The preparation of reaction mixtures is conducted under an inert atmosphere, for example, in an Argon dry box.

The reactor was taken out of the dry box and connected to a hydrogen manifold. The reaction vessel is then charged with H2 (1 atm), employing strict inert-atmosphere laboratory techniques. The reaction mixture is then stirred at a 1200 rpm for 16 hours in an oil bath at 110° C. The reactor is cooled to −35° C. and the reaction mixture quenched with a 10% HCl solution. The temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at −35° C. and a fraction of the organic layer is submitted for GC-MS analysis. Results of the GC-MS analysis show the presence of ethylbenzene (C8H10) at 41.4% yield, after normalization, as the exclusive product component. Example 14 Hydrodesulfurization of 6-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-benzothiophene The preparation of reaction mixtures is conducted under an inert atmosphere, for example, in an Argon dry box. A Teflon-sealed reactor is charged with 106 mg (0.40 mmol) 6-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-benzothiophene, a magnetic stir bar, 20 mg [Ni(NPtBu3)]4 (0.019 mmol), 50 mg (1.25 mmol) KH and 8 mL toluene. The reactor was taken out of the dry box and connected to a hydrogen manifold. The reaction vessel is then charged with H2 (1 atm), employing strict inert-atmosphere laboratory techniques. The reaction mixture is then stirred at 1200 rpm for 16 hours in an oil bath at 120° C. The reactor is cooled to room and quenched with a 10% HCl solution.
