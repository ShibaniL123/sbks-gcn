BACKGROUND The present invention relates generally to aluminum alloys and more specifically to a method for forming high strength aluminum alloy powder having L12 dispersoids therein. The combination of high strength, ductility, and fracture toughness, as well as low density, make aluminum alloys natural candidates for aerospace and space applications. However, their use is typically limited to temperatures below about 300° F. (149° C.) since most aluminum alloys start to lose strength in that temperature range as a result of coarsening of strengthening precipitates. The development of aluminum alloys with improved elevated temperature mechanical properties is a continuing process. Some attempts have included aluminum-iron and aluminum-chromium based alloys such as Al—Fe—Ce, Al—Fe—V—Si, Al—Fe—Ce—W, and Al—Cr—Zr—Mn that contain incoherent dispersoids. These alloys, however, also lose strength at elevated temperatures due to particle coarsening. In addition, these alloys exhibit ductility and fracture toughness values lower than other commercially available aluminum alloys. Other attempts have included the development of mechanically alloyed Al—Mg and Al—Ti alloys containing ceramic dispersoids. These alloys exhibit improved high temperature strength due to the particle dispersion, but the ductility and fracture toughness are not improved. U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,453 owned by the assignee of the present invention discloses aluminum alloys strengthened by dispersed Al3X L12 intermetallic phases where X is selected from the group consisting of Sc, Er, Lu, Yb, Tm, and Lu. The Al3X particles are coherent with the aluminum alloy matrix and are resistant to coarsening at elevated temperatures. The improved mechanical properties of the disclosed dispersion strengthened L12 aluminum alloys are stable up to 572° F. (300° C.). U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0269437 A1 also commonly owned discloses a high strength aluminum alloy that contains scandium and other elements that is strengthened by L12 dispersoids. L12 strengthened aluminum alloys have high strength and improved fatigue properties compared to commercially available aluminum alloys. Fine grain size results in improved mechanical properties of materials. Hall-Petch strengthening has been known for decades where strength increases as grain size decreases. An optimum grain size for optimum strength is in the nanometer range of about 30 to 100 nm. These alloys also have high ductility. SUMMARY The present invention is a method to form consolidated aluminum alloy powders into useful components for aerospace applications. In embodiments, powders include an aluminum alloy having coherent L12 Al3X dispersoids where X is at least one first element selected from scandium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium, and at least one second element selected from gadolinium, yttrium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, and niobium. The balance is substantially aluminum containing at least one alloying element selected from silicon, magnesium, manganese, lithium, copper, zinc, and nickel. The powders are classified by sieving and blended to improve homogeneity. The powders are then vacuum degassed in a container that is then sealed. The sealed container (i.e. can) is vacuum hot pressed to densify the powder charge and then compacted further by blind die compaction or other suitable method. The can is removed and the billet is cored and ring rolled into useful shapes. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is an aluminum scandium phase diagram.

L12 Aluminum Alloys Alloy powders of this invention are formed from aluminum based alloys with high strength and fracture toughness for applications at temperatures from about −420° F. (−251° C.) up to about 650° F. (343° C.). The aluminum alloy comprises a solid solution of aluminum and at least one element selected from silicon, magnesium, manganese, lithium, copper, zinc, and nickel strengthened by L12 Al3X coherent precipitates where X is at least one first element selected from scandium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium, and at least one second element selected from gadolinium, yttrium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, and niobium. The binary aluminum magnesium system is a simple eutectic at 36 weight percent magnesium and 842° F. (450° C.). There is complete solubility of magnesium and aluminum in the rapidly solidified inventive alloys discussed herein. The binary aluminum silicon system is a simple eutectic at 12.6 weight percent silicon and 1070.6° F. (577° C.). There is complete solubility of silicon and aluminum in the rapidly solidified inventive alloys discussed herein. The binary aluminum manganese system is a simple eutectic at about 2 weight percent manganese and 1216.4° F. (658° C.). There is complete solubility of manganese and aluminum in the rapidly solidified inventive alloys discussed herein. The binary aluminum lithium system is a simple eutectic at 8 weight percent lithium and 1105° (596° C.). The equilibrium solubility of 4 weight percent lithium can be extended significantly by rapid solidification techniques. There is complete solubility of lithium in the rapid solidified inventive alloys discussed herein. The binary aluminum copper system is a simple eutectic at 32 weight percent copper and 1018° F. (548° C.). There is complete solubility of copper in the rapidly solidified inventive alloys discussed herein. The aluminum zinc binary system is a eutectic alloy system involving a monotectoid reaction and a miscibility gap in the solid state. There is a eutectic reaction at 94 weight percent zinc and 718° F. (381° C.). Zinc has maximum solid solubility of 83.1 weight percent in aluminum at 717.8° F. (381° C.), which can be extended by rapid solidification processes. Decomposition of the supersaturated solid solution of zinc in aluminum gives rise to spherical and ellipsoidal GP zones, which are coherent with the matrix and act to strengthen the alloy. The aluminum nickel binary system is a simple eutectic at 5.7 weight percent nickel and 1183.8° F. (639.9° C.). There is little solubility of nickel in aluminum. However, the solubility can be extended significantly by utilizing rapid solidification processes. The equilibrium phase in the aluminum nickel eutectic system is L12 intermetallic Al3Ni. In the aluminum based alloys disclosed herein, scandium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium are potent strengtheners that have low diffusivity and low solubility in aluminum. All these elements form equilibrium Al3X intermetallic dispersoids where X is at least one of scandium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium, that have an L12 structure that is an ordered face centered cubic structure with the X atoms located at the corners and aluminum atoms located on the cube faces of the unit cell. Scandium forms Al3Sc dispersoids that are fine and coherent with the aluminum matrix. Lattice parameters of aluminum and Al3Sc are very close (0.405 nm and 0.410 nm respectively), indicating that there is minimal or no driving force for causing growth of the Al3Sc dispersoids. This low interfacial energy makes the Al3Sc dispersoids thermally stable and resistant to coarsening up to temperatures as high as about 842° F. (450° C.). Additions of magnesium in aluminum increase the lattice parameter of the aluminum matrix, and decrease the lattice parameter mismatch further increasing the resistance of the Al3Sc to coarsening. Additions of zinc, copper, lithium, silicon, manganese and nickel provide solid solution and precipitation strengthening in the aluminum alloys. These Al3Sc dispersoids are made stronger and more resistant to coarsening at elevated temperatures by adding suitable alloying elements such as gadolinium, yttrium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, niobium, or combinations thereof, that enter Al3Sc in solution. Erbium forms Al3Er dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that are fine and coherent with the aluminum matrix. The lattice parameters of aluminum and Al3Er are close (0.405 nm and 0.417 nm respectively), indicating there is minimal driving force for causing growth of the Al3Er dispersoids. This low interfacial energy makes the Al3Er dispersoids thermally stable and resistant to coarsening up to temperatures as high as about 842° F. (450° C.). Additions of magnesium in aluminum increase the lattice parameter of the aluminum matrix, and decrease the lattice parameter mismatch further increasing the resistance of the Al3Er to coarsening. Additions of zinc, copper, lithium, silicon, manganese and nickel provide solid solution and precipitation strengthening in the aluminum alloys. These Al3Er dispersoids are made stronger and more resistant to coarsening at elevated temperatures by adding suitable alloying elements such as gadolinium, yttrium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, niobium, or combinations thereof that enter Al3Er in solution. Thulium forms metastable Al3Tm dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that are fine and coherent with the aluminum matrix. The lattice parameters of aluminum and Al3Tm are close (0.405 nm and 0.420 nm respectively), indicating there is minimal driving force for causing growth of the Al3Tm dispersoids. This low interfacial energy makes the Al3Tm dispersoids thermally stable and resistant to coarsening up to temperatures as high as about 842° F. (450° C.). Additions of magnesium in aluminum increase the lattice parameter of the aluminum matrix, and decrease the lattice parameter mismatch further increasing the resistance of the Al3Tm to coarsening. Additions of zinc, copper, lithium, silicon, manganese and nickel provide solid solution and precipitation strengthening in the aluminum alloys. These Al3Tm dispersoids are made stronger and more resistant to coarsening at elevated temperatures by adding suitable alloying elements such as gadolinium, yttrium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, niobium, or combinations thereof that enter Al3Tm in solution. Ytterbium forms Al3Yb dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that are fine and coherent with the aluminum matrix. The lattice parameters of Al and Al3Yb are close (0.405 nm and 0.420 nm respectively), indicating there is minimal driving force for causing growth of the Al3Yb dispersoids. This low interfacial energy makes the Al3Yb dispersoids thermally stable and resistant to coarsening up to temperatures as high as about 842° F. (450° C.). Additions of magnesium in aluminum increase the lattice parameter of the aluminum matrix, and decrease the lattice parameter mismatch further increasing the resistance of the Al3Yb to coarsening. Additions of zinc, copper, lithium, silicon, manganese and nickel provide solid solution and precipitation strengthening in the aluminum alloys. These Al3Yb dispersoids are made stronger and more resistant to coarsening at elevated temperatures by adding suitable alloying elements such as gadolinium, yttrium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, niobium, or combinations thereof that enter Al3Yb in solution. Lutetium forms Al3Lu dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that are fine and coherent with the aluminum matrix. The lattice parameters of Al and Al3Lu are close (0.405 nm and 0.419 nm respectively), indicating there is minimal driving force for causing growth of the Al3Lu dispersoids. This low interfacial energy makes the Al3Lu dispersoids thermally stable and resistant to coarsening up to temperatures as high as about 842° F. (450° C.). Additions of magnesium in aluminum increase the lattice parameter of the aluminum matrix, and decrease the lattice parameter mismatch further increasing the resistance of the Al3Lu to coarsening. Additions of zinc, copper, lithium, silicon, manganese and nickel provide solid solution and precipitation strengthening in the aluminum alloys. These Al3Lu dispersoids are made stronger and more resistant to coarsening at elevated temperatures by adding suitable alloying elements such as gadolinium, yttrium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, niobium, or mixtures thereof that enter Al3Lu in solution. Gadolinium forms metastable Al3Gd dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that are stable up to temperatures as high as about 842° F. (450° C.) due to their low diffusivity in aluminum. The Al3Gd dispersoids have a D019 structure in the equilibrium condition. Despite its large atomic size, gadolinium has fairly high solubility in the Al3X intermetallic dispersoids (where X is scandium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium or lutetium). Gadolinium can substitute for the X atoms in Al3X intermetallic, thereby forming an ordered L12 phase which results in improved thermal and structural stability. Yttrium forms metastable Al3Y dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that have an L12 structure in the metastable condition and a D019 structure in the equilibrium condition. The metastable Al3Y dispersoids have a low diffusion coefficient, which makes them thermally stable and highly resistant to coarsening. Yttrium has a high solubility in the Al3X intermetallic dispersoids allowing large amounts of yttrium to substitute for X in the Al3X L12 dispersoids, which results in improved thermal and structural stability. Zirconium forms Al3Zr dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that have an L12 structure in the metastable condition and D023 structure in the equilibrium condition. The metastable Al3Zr dispersoids have a low diffusion coefficient, which makes them thermally stable and highly resistant to coarsening. Zirconium has a high solubility in the Al3X dispersoids allowing large amounts of zirconium to substitute for X in the Al3X dispersoids, which results in improved thermal and structural stability. Titanium forms Al3Ti dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that have an L12 structure in the metastable condition and D022 structure in the equilibrium condition. The metastable Al3Ti despersoids have a low diffusion coefficient, which makes them thermally stable and highly resistant to coarsening. Titanium has a high solubility in the Al3X dispersoids allowing large amounts of titanium to substitute for X in the Al3X dispersoids, which result in improved thermal and structural stability. Hafnium forms metastable Al3Hf dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that have an L12 structure in the metastable condition and a D023 structure in the equilibrium condition. The Al3Hf dispersoids have a low diffusion coefficient, which makes them thermally stable and highly resistant to coarsening. Hafnium has a high solubility in the Al3X dispersoids allowing large amounts of hafnium to substitute for scandium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium in the above-mentioned Al3X dispersoids, which results in stronger and more thermally stable dispersoids. Niobium forms metastable Al3Nb dispersoids in the aluminum matrix that have an L12 structure in the metastable condition and a D022 structure in the equilibrium condition. Niobium has a lower solubility in the Al3X dispersoids than hafnium or yttrium, allowing relatively lower amounts of niobium than hafnium or yttrium to substitute for X in the Al3X dispersoids. Nonetheless, niobium can be very effective in slowing down the coarsening kinetics of the Al3X dispersoids because the Al3Nb dispersoids are thermally stable. The substitution of niobium for X in the above mentioned Al3X dispersoids results in stronger and more thermally stable dispersoids. Al3X L12 precipitates improve elevated temperature mechanical properties in aluminum alloys for two reasons. First, the precipitates are ordered intermetallic compounds. As a result, when the particles are sheared by glide dislocations during deformation, the dislocations separate into two partial dislocations separated by an anti-phase boundary on the glide plane. The energy to create the anti-phase boundary is the origin of the strengthening. Second, the cubic L12 crystal structure and lattice parameter of the precipitates are closely matched to the aluminum solid solution matrix. This results in a lattice coherency at the precipitate/matrix boundary that resists coarsening. The lack of an interphase boundary results in a low driving force for particle growth and resulting elevated temperature stability. Alloying elements in solid solution in the dispersed strengthening particles and in the aluminum matrix that tend to decrease the lattice mismatch between the matrix and particles will tend to increase the strengthening and elevated temperature stability of the alloy. L12 phase strengthened aluminum alloys are important structural materials because of their excellent mechanical properties and the stability of these properties at elevated temperature due to the resistance of the coherent dispersoids in the microstructure to particle coarsening. The mechanical properties are optimized by maintaining a high volume fraction of L12 dispersoids in the microstructure. The L12 dispersoid concentration following aging scales as the amount of L12 phase forming elements in solid solution in the aluminum alloy following quenching. Examples of L12 phase forming elements include but are not limited to Sc, Er, Th, Yb, and Lu. The concentration of alloying elements in solid solution in alloys cooled from the melt is directly proportional to the cooling rate. Exemplary aluminum alloys for this invention include, but are not limited to (in weight percent unless otherwise specified): about Al-M-(0.1-4)Sc—(0.1-20)Gd; about Al-M-(0.1-20)Er—(0.1-20)Gd; about Al-M-(0.1-15)Tm—(0.1-20)Gd; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Yb—(0.1-20)Gd; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Lu—(0.1-20)Gd; about Al-M-(0.1-4)Sc—(0.1-20)Y; about Al-M-(0.1-20)Er—(0.1-20)Y; about Al-M-(0.1-15)Tm—(0.1-20)Y; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Yb—(0.1-20)Y; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Lu—(0.1-20)Y; about Al-M-(0.1-4)Sc—(0.05-4)Zr; about Al-M-(0.1-20)Er—(0.05-4)Zr; about Al-M-(0.1-15)Tm—(0.05-4)Zr; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Yb—(0.05-4)Zr; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Lu—(0.05-4)Zr; about Al-M-(0.1-4)Sc—(0.05-10)Ti; about Al-M-(0.1-20)Er—(0.05-10)Ti; about Al-M-(0.1-15)Tm—(0.05-10)Ti; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Yb—(0.05-10)Ti; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Lu—(0.05-10)Ti; about Al-M-(0.1-4)Sc—(0.05-10)Hf; about Al-M-(0.1-20)Er—(0.05-10)Hf; about Al-M-(0.1-15)Tm—(0.05-10)Hf; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Yb—(0.05-10)Hf; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Lu—(0.05-10)Hf; about Al-M-(0.1-4)Sc—(0.05-5)Nb; about Al-M-(0.1-20)Er—(0.05-5)Nb; about Al-M-(0.1-15)Tm—(0.05-5)Nb; about Al-M-(0.1-25)Yb—(0.05-5)Nb; and about Al-M-(0.1-25)Lu—(0.05-5)Nb.

Specific elements that should be reduced or eliminated include no more than about 0.1 weight percent iron, 0.1 weight percent chromium, 0.1 weight percent vanadium, and 0.1 weight percent cobalt. The total quantity of additional elements should not exceed about 1% by weight, including the above listed impurities and other elements. 2. L12 Alloy Powder Formation The highest cooling rates observed in commercially viable processes are achieved by gas atomization of molten metals to produce powder. Gas atomization is a two fluid process wherein a stream of molten metal is disintegrated by a high velocity gas stream. The end result is that the particles of molten metal eventually become spherical due to surface tension and finely solidify in powder form. Heat from the liquid droplets is transferred to the atomization gas by convection. The solidification rates, depending on the gas and the surrounding environment, can be very high and can exceed 106° C./second. Cooling rates greater than 103° C./second are typically specified to ensure supersaturation of alloying elements in gas atomized L12 aluminum alloy powder in the inventive process described herein. A schematic of typical vertical gas atomizer 100 is shown in FIG. 6A. FIG. 6A is taken from R. Germain, Powder Metallurgy Science Second Edition MPIF (1994) (chapter 3, p. 101) and is included herein for reference. Vacuum or inert gas induction melter 102 is positioned at the top of free flight chamber 104. Vacuum induction melter 102 contains melt 106 which flows by gravity or gas overpressure through nozzle 108. A close up view of nozzle 108 is shown in FIG. 6B. Melt 106 enters nozzle 108 and flows downward till it meets the high pressure gas stream from gas source 110 where it is transformed into a spray of droplets. The droplets eventually become spherical due to surface tension and rapidly solidify into spherical powder 112 which collects in collection chamber 114. The gas recirculates through cyclone collector 116 which collects fine powder 118 before returning to the input gas stream. As can be seen from FIG. 6A, the surroundings to which the melt and eventual powder are exposed are completely controlled. There are many effective nozzle designs known in the art to produce spherical metal powder. Designs with short gas-to-melt separation distances produce finer powders. Confined nozzle designs where gas meets the molten stream at a short distance just after it leaves the atomization nozzle are preferred for the production of the inventive L12 aluminum alloy powders disclosed herein. Higher superheat temperatures cause lower melt viscosity and longer cooling times. Both result in smaller spherical particles. A large number of processing parameters are associated with gas atomization that affect the final product. Examples include melt superheat, gas pressure, metal flow rate, gas type, and gas purity. In gas atomization, the particle size is related to the energy input to the metal. Higher gas pressures, higher superheat temperatures and lower metal flow rates result in smaller particle sizes. Higher gas pressures provide higher gas velocities for a given atomization nozzle design. To maintain purity, inert gases are used, such as helium, argon, and nitrogen. Helium is preferred for rapid solidification because the high heat transfer coefficient of the gas leads to high quenching rates and high supersaturation of alloying elements. Lower metal flow rates and higher gas flow ratios favor production of finer powders. The particle size of gas atomized melts typically has a log normal distribution. In the turbulent conditions existing at the gas/metal interface during atomization, ultra fine particles can form that may reenter the gas expansion zone. These solidified fine particles can be carried into the flight path of molten larger droplets resulting in agglomeration of small satellite particles on the surfaces of larger particles. An example of small satellite particles attached to inventive spherical L12 aluminum alloy powder is shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of FIGS. 7A and 7B at two magnifications. The spherical shape of gas atomized aluminum powder is evident. The spherical shape of the powder is suggestive of clean powder without excessive oxidation. Higher oxygen in the powder results in irregular powder shape. Spherical powder helps in improving the flowability of powder which results in higher apparent density and tap density of the powder. The satellite particles can be minimized by adjusting processing parameters to reduce or even eliminate turbulence in the gas atomization process. The microstructure of gas atomized aluminum alloy powder is predominantly cellular as shown in the optical micrographs of cross-sections of the inventive alloy in FIGS. 8A and 8B at two magnifications. The rapid cooling rate suppresses dendritic solidification common at slower cooling rates resulting in a finer microstructure with minimum alloy segregation. Oxygen and hydrogen in the powder can degrade the mechanical properties of the final part. It is preferred to limit the oxygen in the L12 alloy powder to about 1 ppm to 2000 ppm. Oxygen is intentionally introduced as a component of the helium gas during atomization. An oxide coating on the L12 aluminum powder is beneficial for two reasons. First, the coating prevents agglomeration by contact sintering and secondly, the coating inhibits the chance of explosion of the powder. A controlled amount of oxygen is important in order to provide good ductility and fracture toughness in the final consolidated material. Hydrogen content in the powder is controlled by ensuring the dew point of the helium gas is low. A dew point of about minus 50° F. (minus 45.5° C.) to minus 100° F. (minus 73.3° C.) is preferred. In preparation for final processing, the powder is classified according to size by sieving. To prepare the powder for sieving, if the powder has zero percent oxygen content, the powder may be exposed to nitrogen gas which passivates the powder surface and prevents agglomeration. Finer powder sizes result in improved mechanical properties of the end product. While minus 325 mesh (about 45 microns) powder can be used, minus 450 mesh (about 30 microns) powder is a preferred size in order to provide good mechanical properties in the end product. During the atomization process, powder is collected in collection chambers in order to prevent oxidation of the powder. Collection chambers are used at the bottom of atomization chamber 104 as well as at the bottom of cyclone collector 116. The powder is transported and stored in the collection chambers also. Collection chambers are maintained under positive pressure with nitrogen gas which prevents oxidation of the powder. A schematic of the L12 aluminum powder manufacturing process is shown in FIG. 9. In the process aluminum 200 and L12 forming (and other alloying elements) 210 are melted in furnace 220 to a predetermined superheat temperature under vacuum or inert atmosphere. Preferred charge for furnace 220 is prealloyed aluminum 200 and L12 and other alloying elements before charging furnace 220. Melt 230 is then passed through nozzle 240 where it is impacted by pressurized gas stream 250. Gas stream 250 is an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon or helium, preferably helium. Melt 230 can flow through nozzle 240 under gravity or under pressure. Gravity flow is preferred for the inventive process disclosed herein. Preferred pressures for pressurized gas stream 250 are about 50 psi (10.35 MPa) to about 750 psi (5.17 MPa) depending on the alloy. The atomization process creates molten droplets 260 which rapidly solidify as they travel through chamber 270 forming spherical powder particles 280. The molten droplets transfer heat to the atomizing gas by convention. The role of the atomizing gas is two fold: one is to disintegrate the molten metal stream into fine droplets by transferring kinetic energy from the gas to the melt stream and the other is to extract heat from the molten droplets to rapidly solidify them into spherical powder. The solidification time and cooling rate vary with droplet size. Larger droplets take longer to solidify and their resulting cooling rate is lower. On the other hand, the atomizing gas will extract heat efficiently from smaller droplets resulting in a higher cooling rate. Finer powder size is therefore preferred as higher cooling rates provide finer microstructures and higher mechanical properties in the end product. Higher cooling rates lead to finer cellular microstructures which are preferred for higher mechanical properties. Finer cellular microstructures result in finer grain sizes in consolidated product. Finer grain size provides higher yield strength of the material through the Hall-Petch strengthening model. Key process variables for gas atomization include superheat temperature, nozzle diameter, helium content and dew point of the gas, and metal flow rate. Superheat temperatures of from about 150° F. (66° C.) to 200° F. (93° C.) are preferred. Nozzle diameters of about 0.07 in. (1.8 mm) to 0.12 in. (3.0 mm) are preferred depending on the alloy. The gas stream used herein was a helium nitrogen mixture containing 74 to 87 vol. % helium. The metal flow rate ranged from about 0.8 lb/min (0.36 kg/min) to 4.0 lb/min (1.81 kg/min). The oxygen content of the L12 aluminum alloy powders was observed to consistently decrease as a run progressed. This is suggested to be the result of the oxygen gettering capability of the aluminum powder in a closed system. The dew point of the gas was controlled to minimize hydrogen content of the powder. Dew points in the gases used in the examples ranged from −10° F. (−23° C.) to −110° F. (−79° C.). The powder is then classified by sieving process 290 to create classified powder 300. Sieving of powder is performed under an inert environment to minimize oxygen and hydrogen pickup from the environment. While the yield of minus 450 mesh powder is extremely high (95%), there are always larger particle sizes, flakes and ligaments that are removed by the sieving. Sieving also ensures a narrow size distribution and provides a more uniform powder size. Sieving also ensures that flaw sizes cannot be greater than minus 450 mesh which will be required for nondestructive inspection of the final product. Processing parameters of exemplary gas atomization runs are listed in Table 1.

Powder quality is determined by powder size, shape, size distribution, oxygen content, hydrogen content, and alloy chemistry. Over fifty gas atomization runs were performed to produce the inventive powder with finer powder size, finer size distribution, spherical shape, and lower oxygen and hydrogen contents. Processing parameters of some exemplary gas atomization runs are listed in Table 1. It is suggested that the observed decrease in oxygen content is attributed to oxygen gettering by the powder as the runs progressed. Inventive L12 aluminum alloy powder was produced with over 95% yield of minus 450 mesh (30 microns) which includes powder from about 1 micron to about 30 microns. The average powder size was about 10 microns to about 15 microns. As noted above, finer powder size is preferred for higher mechanical properties. Finer powders have finer cellular microstructures. As a result, finer cell sizes lead to finer grain size by fragmentation and coalescence of cells during powder consolidation. Finer grain sizes produce higher yield strength through the Hall-Petch strengthening model where yield strength varies inversely as the square root of the grain size. It is preferred to use powder with an average particle size of 10-15 microns. Powders with a powder size less than 10-15 microns can be more challenging to handle due to the larger surface area of the powder. Powders with sizes larger than 10-15 microns will result in larger cell sizes in the consolidated product which, in turn, will lead to larger grain sizes and lower yield strengths. Powders with narrow size distributions are preferred. Narrower powder size distributings produce product microstructures with more uniform grain size. Spherical powder was produced to provide higher apparent and tap densities which help in achieving 100% density in the consolidated product. Spherical shape is also an indication of cleaner and low oxygen content powder. Lower oxygen and lower hydrogen contents are important in producing material with high ductility and fracture toughness. Although it is beneficial to maintain low oxygen and hydrogen content in powder to achieve good mechanical properties, lower oxygen may interfere with sieving due to self sintering. An oxygen content of about 25 ppm to about 500 ppm is preferred to provide good ductility and fracture toughness without any sieving issue. Lower hydrogen is also preferred for improving ductility and fracture toughness. It is preferred to have about 25-200 ppm of hydrogen in atomized powder by controlling the dew point in the atomization chamber. Hydrogen in the powder is further reduced by heating the powder in vacuum. Lower hydrogen in final product is preferred to achieve good ductility and fracture toughness. A schematic of the L12 aluminum powder consolidation process is shown in FIG. 10. The starting material is sieved and classified L12 aluminum alloy powders (step 310). Blending (step 320) is a preferred step in the consolidation process because it results in improved uniformity of particle size distribution. Gas atomized L12 aluminum alloy powder generally exhibits a bimodal particle size distribution and cross blending of separate powder batches tends to homogenize the particle size distribution. Blending (step 320) is also preferred when separate metal and/or ceramic powders are added to the L12 base powder to form bimodal or trimodal consolidated alloy microstructures. Following blending (step 320), the powders are transferred to a can (step 330) where the powder is vacuum degassed (step 340) at elevated temperatures. The can (step 330) is an aluminum container preferably having a rectangular configuration for superplastic forging as described in this invention. Vacuum degassing times can range from about 0.5 hours to about 8 days. A temperature range of about 300° F. (149° C.) to about 900° F. (482° C.) is preferred. Dynamic degassing of large amounts of powder is preferred to static degassing. In dynamic degassing, the can is preferably rotated during degassing to expose all of the powder to a uniform temperature. Degassing removes oxygen and hydrogen from the powder. Following vacuum degassing (step 340), the vacuum line is crimped and welded shut (step 350). The powder is then consolidated further by hot pressing (step 360) or by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) (step 370). At this point the can may be removed by machining. Following compaction, the billet is shaped into a preform suitable for subsequent ring rolling. The stability of the elevated temperature mechanical properties of the L12 aluminum alloys discussed herein allow them to be useful at operating temperatures exceeding 572° F. (300° C.). These lightweight alloys can be employed, for instance, in aerospace propulsion systems such as gas turbine and rocket engines in regions where they can now substitute for heavier and more expensive components made of, for instance, titanium and stainless steels. Consolidated L12 aluminum alloys can be formed into large shapes suitable for fan enclosures and other engine shrouds with improved elevated temperature mechanical properties by ring rolling. The starting shape for a ring rolling preform is a ring. Ring rolling performs can be produced by forging, rolling, or other methods known in the art. Open die forging will be described herein as an example of producing a ring rolling preform. A schematic illustration of open die forging process 400 to produce a ring rolling preform is shown in FIGS. 11A-11D. FIG. 11A shows L12 alloy billet 410 on anvil 420 and hammer 430 before forging. As indicated by the arrow in the FIG., the forging process commences when hammer 430 is dropped or otherwise forced downward to compress billet 410 in the axial direction such that the height of billet 410 is decreased as shown in FIG. 11B after forging. In the next step, billet 410 is punched and pierced. This occurs by placing piercing tool 440 on billet 410 and forging such that hammer 430 forces piercing tool 440 through billet 410 to produce “doughnut shaped” forged and pierced L12 alloy billet 410 as a ring rolling preform. Open die forging of L12 alloy billets is preferably performed at temperatures of 300° F. (149° C.) to 900° F. (482.2° C.) and strain rates of about 0.1 min−1 to about 25 min−1. As shown in FIG. 11A, initial billet 410 is preferably cylindrical in shape. Ring rolling is accomplished by a powered main roll acting against an idler roll with the work piece in between as shown in the schematic of ring rolling apparatus 500 in FIG. 12. FIG. 12 shows main roll 510 and drive shaft 520, work piece 530, idler roll 540, slave roll 550 and edging rolls 560 and 570 in this depiction of a ring rolling setup. FIG. 12 is only an example and other ring roll arrangements are, of course, used in the art. During a ring rolling operation, main roll 510, driven in the direction of arrow 510′, is forced against work piece 530 by a radial force in the direction of arrow 515. This squeezes work piece 530 between main roll 510 and fixed idler roll 540, rotating in the direction of arrow 540′. Slave roll 550 and edging rolls 560 and 570 rotating in the directions indicated by arrows 550′, 560′, and 570′ respectively serve to stabilize the shape of the rolled billet during processing. As ring rolling proceeds, the wall of the billet becomes thinner and the diameter increases. Ring rolling is a convenient and economical method to fabricate structures with circular cross sections with excellent surface finish. The initial billets can be in the form of doughnut shaped forgings or of welded tubular and ring structures. Rolled parts with different cross sectional configurations can be produced using main and/or idler rolls with contoured surfaces. The process is ideal for forming thin structures such as shrouds and fan cases for turbine engines. If a welded body is used initially, ring rolling will homogenize the microstructure as well as the mechanical properties in the vicinity of the weld joint and maintain uniform structural integrity. L12 aluminum alloys can be formed into high strength components using ring rolling. Although as-consolidated starting material can be used, it is preferred to use extruded, forged, or rolled material as starting material for ring rolling. Intermediate stress relief anneals or elevated temperature forming are preferred due to the large deformation associated with forming thin ring rolled parts. Working temperature ranges for ring rolling L12 aluminum alloys are from about 400° F. (204.4° C.) to 900° F. (482.2° C.). Strain rates range from 0.1 min−1 to 20 min−1 with 0.5 min−1 to 5 min−1 being preferred to maintain a finer microstructure. Intermediate stress relief enables at temperatures from 400° F. (204.4° C.) to 900° F. (482.2° C.) are preferred. The elevated temperature mechanical properties of the inventive L12 high strength aluminum alloys discussed herein make them candidates for structural application in moderate temperature regions of the gas flow train of rocket and jet engines as well as in land based power generation systems. Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. 1.
