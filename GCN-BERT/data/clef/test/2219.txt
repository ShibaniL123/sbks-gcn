BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Chromenes constitute a privileged class of structural motifs present in a myriad of natural products and medicinally important agents. Given the prevalence of this structural unit, there has been considerable interest in developing methods for the generation of the chromene skeleton. While procedures to access racemic 2-aryl-2H-chromenes are readily available, the difficulty in generating enantioselective variants is underscored by the scarcity of documented strategies to produce these bioactive structures. The construction of enantioenriched 2-aryl-2H-chromenes has been recently reported by You through a Ru-catalyzed ring-closing metathesis reaction of chiral allyl ethers and also by Schaus via the chiral Brønsted acid (CBA)/Lewis acid-catalyzed addition of aryl boronates to in situ formed pyrylium ions. In addition, Rueping has recently reported a CBA-catalyzed closure of allylic cations, but this innovative approach requires substitution at C4. (See, e.g., H. He, K. Y. Ye, Q. F. Wu, L. X. Dai and S. L. You, Adv. Synth. Catal., 2012, 354, 1084-1094; C. Hardouin, L. Burgaud, A. Valleix and E. Doris, Tetrahedron Lett., 2003, 44, 435-437; P. N. Moquist, T. Kodama and S. E. Schaus, Angew.

Such objects, features, benefits and advantages will be apparent from the above as taken into conjunction with the accompanying examples, data, FIGURES and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, alone or with consideration of the references incorporated herein. In part, the present invention can be directed to a method for asymmetric synthesis of a 2-aryl chromene compound. Such a method can comprise providing a reaction medium comprising an o-arylallyl-substituted phenoxy ester starting material of a formula wherein X can be selected from alkylcarbonyl and alkylcarbonyl moieties, LG can be a leaving group selected from alkoxycarbonyl groups, R can be selected from H, halo, alkyl and alkoxy moieties, multiple moieties and combinations thereof and Ar can be a moiety selected from aryl and substituted aryl moieties, such aryl substituents as can be selected from halo, alkyl, alkoxy and nitro substituents, multiple such substituents and combinations thereof; introducing a palladium (II) catalyst precursor compound and a phosphoramidite ligand compound to such a reaction medium; reacting such a starting material with a base component to promote intramolecular cyclization of such a reacted starting material and provide an asymmetric 2-aryl chromene compound of a formula In certain non-limiting embodiments, such a phosphoramidite ligand compound can be of a formula wherein R and R1 can be independently selected from alkyl, phenyl, phenylalkyl and cycloalkyl moieties, and where R and R1 can together provide a divalent alkylene moiety; each R2 can be independently selected from methyl and ethyl moieties, and where the R2 moieties together can provide a divalent moiety selected from alkylene and alkyl-substituted alkylene moieties; and each Ar can be independently selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl moieties. In certain such embodiments, each of R and R1 can be a chiral CH(CH3)C6H5 moiety. In certain other such embodiments, R and R1 can together provide a divalent (CH2)m moiety, wherein m can be an integer selected from 4-6. Regardless, without limitation, each Ar can be an alkyl-substituted phenyl moiety. In certain embodiments, such a phosphoramidite ligand compound can be of a formula wherein each R3 can be independently selected from methyl and ethyl moieties and combinations thereof, and each n can independently be an integer selected from 1-3. In certain such non-limiting embodiments, each R3 can be ethyl and each n can be 2, to provide such a ligand compound with 3,5-diethyl substituted phenyl moieties. With respect to an aforementioned ester starting material, such an Ar moiety can be selected from substituted phenyl and naphthyl moieties. In certain non-limiting embodiments, such a phenyl moiety can be substituted with one or more halo, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro and haloalkyl substituents, multiple such substituents and combinations thereof. Regardless, X can be selected from acetyl and benzoyl moieties, and LG can be selected from acetyloxy and benzoyloxy moieties. In certain such embodiments, X can be acetyl and LG can be acetyloxy, to provide a bis-acetate starting material. Irrespective of ester identity, chromene synthesis can proceed with a phosphoramidite ligand of the sort described above, wherein, for instance, R and R1 can together provide a divalent (CH2)m moiety, where m can be an integer selected from 4-6, and each Ar can be an alkylated phenyl moiety. In part, the present invention can also be directed to a method of using intramolecular cyclization for enantioselective synthesis of a 2-aryl-2H-chromene compound. Such a method can comprise providing a reaction medium comprising an o-arylallyl-substituted bis-acetate compound of the sort described herein, a base component, a palladium (II) catalyst precursor compound and a chiral phosphoramidite ligand compound of the sort discussed above or illustrated elsewhere herein (e.g., without limitation, L3 or L4, below); and deacylating such a bis-acetate compound to promote intramolecular cyclization and C—O bond formation, to enantioselectively provide a compound of a formula wherein R is selected from H, halo, alkyl and alkoxy moieties, and Ar is selected from phenyl, substituted phenyl and naphthyl moieties, whereby such a compound can have an enantiomeric ratio of greater than about 60:40 for said enantiomer. In certain non-limiting embodiments, such a ligand compound can be of the sort described above and illustrated elsewhere herein. For instance, R and R1 can together provide a divalent (CH2)m moiety, wherein m is an integer selected from 4-6. Alternatively, R can be alkyl and R1 can be cycloalkyl. Regardless of R/R1 identity, each Ar can be an alkyl-substituted phenyl moiety. In certain embodiments, each Ar can be a dialkyl-substituted phenyl moiety, such as a 3,5-dimethyl- or a 3,5-diethyl-substituted phenyl moiety. Use of such ligand compounds in conjunction with the present method(s) can provide a 2-aryl-2H-chromene compound with an enantiomeric ratio of greater than about 90:10 for one enantiomer thereof. In part, the present invention can also be directed to compositions comprising compounds of a formula wherein R can be selected from H, halo, alkyl and alkoxy moieties, multiple such moieties and combinations thereof and Ar can be selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl moieties, such phenyl substituents as can be selected from halo, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro and haloalkyl substituents, multiple such substituents and combinations thereof, such a composition as can comprise at least about 70% an enantiomer of a formula In certain non-limiting embodiments, such a moiety can be selected from methyl, methoxy, fluoro, chloro, nitro and dichlorosubstituted phenyl moieties, and such a composition can comprise at least about 90% of such an enantiomer. Accordingly, the present invention can, in part, be directed to a ligand compound of a formula wherein R and R1 can be independently selected from alkyl, phenyl, phenylalkyl and cycloalkyl moieties, and where R and R1 can together provide a divalent alkylene moiety; each R2 can be independently selected from methyl and ethyl moieties, and where the R2 moieties together can provide a divalent moiety selected from alkylene and alkyl-substituted alkylene moieties; and each Ar can be independently selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl moieties. In certain such embodiments, each of R and R1 can be a chiral CH(CH3)C6H5 moiety. In certain other such embodiments, R and R1 can together provide a divalent (CH2)m moiety, wherein m can be an integer selected from 4-6. In various other non-limiting embodiments, R can be a methyl moiety and R1 can be a cyclohexyl moiety, or R and R1 can together provide a divalent (CH2)5 moiety; each R2 can be a methyl moiety or each R2 can together provide a divalent C(CH3)2 moiety; and each Ar can be independently selected from phenyl, methyl- and polymethyl-substituted phenyl, and ethyl and polyethyl-substituted phenyl moieties. As discussed below, such a ligand compound can be complexed, bound, coordinated or otherwise coupled to a palladium metal component.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1. Schematic reaction design for 2-aryl-2H-chromenes, illustrating methods of this invention and, without limitation, representative compounds available therefrom. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS By way of developing new approaches to construct pyran and related motifs, an investigation was begun relating to substrate/catalyst activation combinations to access chromenes via an asymmetric catalytic process. After extensive exploration with substrates such as 1 (not shown), easily accessed from chalcone precursors, the use of either organocatalysis or transition metal catalysis led to an invariable observation: compounds with unprotected ortho-substituted phenols were typically unstable and often underwent uncatalyzed cyclizations to racemic chromenes rapidly (eq 1). With this data in hand and the background reaction a concern, the following reaction design factors were considered: a) promote phenol formation during the course of the reaction, b) avoid any background reactions by activating an allylic system through a chiral metal complex or organocatalytic mechanism, and c) promote a 6-endo-trig type closure of the phenol/phenoxide with control of the absolute stereochemistry. Based on this logic, it was envisaged that 2-aryl-2H-chromenes could be constructed through a 6-endo-trig Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution (FIG. 1). While Pd-catalyzed allylic alkylation is a prominent strategy for C—C and C-heteroatom bond formation, it is believed there are no reports of a general asymmetric 6-endo-trig variant. This investigation began by combining bis-acetate 1a with potassium carbonate, a palladium source or catalyst precursor compound such as palladium dibenzylideneacetone, Pd2(dba)3, and a variety of phosphoramidite ligands. (Various other palladium sources can be used, as would be understood by those skilled in the art and made aware of this invention.) Although monodentate phosphoramidites are efficient chiral ligands in promoting various Pd-catalyzed reactions, their application in asymmetric allylic substitutions remains underdeveloped. Initial ligand screens included BINOL-, SIPHOS-, and TADDOL-derived phosphoramidites. Preliminary experiments with BINOL-derived ligand L1a provided chromene 2a in quantitative yield with an encouraging 69:31 enantiomeric ratio (Table 1, entry 1). Unfortunately, modification of the amine constituent to piperidine, dimethylamine, 1-phenylethylamine (results not shown) or bis[(S)-1-phenethyl]amine (entry 2), was detrimental to both the conversion and enantioselectivity. The modification of the ligand backbone to SIPHOS-derived ligand (Ra,R,R)-L2 and TADDOL-derived ligand L3a resulted in significantly improved levels of enantioselectivity (entries 3 and 5, respectively). Interestingly, the diastereomer (Sa,R,R)-L2 (entry 4) afforded racemic chromene product, suggesting a mismatch of stereogenic elements.

Longer reactions did not provide side products. bEnantiomeric ratio determined by HPLC. Due to the shortened reaction time with ligand L3a compared to L2 and the opportunity to rapidly evaluate a wide range of TADDOL-derived ligands, efforts were focused on the optimization of this ligand backbone. A variety of N-substituents were evaluated, including achiral and sterically less demanding amine moieties (entry 6-8). In comparison to ligand L3a, other acyclic amines such as dimethylamine (entry 6) and diisopropyl amine (entry 7) resulted in decreased enantioselectivity, while replacement with the more rigid piperidinyl substituent afforded chromene 2a with improved selectivity (82:18 er, entry 8). To understand the effects of ligand rigidity on engendering enantioselection, the isopropylidene acetal of L3 was substituted with an acyclic dimethyl ether motif. With the less rigid L4 as the ligand, chromene 2a was furnished with low enantioselectivity (entry 9). Another point of variation of the TADDOL-derived ligands lies in the substitution about the arene rings. The examination of various aryl-substituted TADDOL ligands (entry 10-12) revealed that enantioselectivity can be enhanced through the placement and positioning of methyl groups on the aryl ring, culminating in a 93:7 er attained for ligand L3g (entry 12). The effects of the nitrogen substituent were then revisited. Interestingly, the replacement of the piperidine with a pyrrolidine resulted in a significant decrease in enantioselectivity (entry 13), while incorporation of a 7-membered azepane maintained the previously observed 93:7 er (entry 14). Efforts to increase enantioselectivity by utilizing acyclic amines were ineffective (entry 15). Finally, the incorporation of ethyl groups at the 3- and 5-position of the aryl ring was explored. It was interesting to find that with this ligand (L3k), chromene 2a was obtained in 71% isolated yield with 95:5 er (entry 16).

Yield of isolated product after chromatography. Enantiomeric Ratio Determined by HPLC Analysis. With selective conditions developed, several bis-acetate substrates were evaluated (Table 2). The high levels of enantioselectivity observed for 2a were maintained with extended aromatic moieties (2b and 2c). Electron-donating groups on the styrenyl component were also well-tolerated, with methyl substitution in the ortho- or para-positions (2d and 2e, respectively) affording the chromene products in good yield and excellent enantioselectivity. The electron-rich 3-methoxy substituted cyclization precursor also performed well in this reaction, generating chromene 2f (78%, 94:6 er). The incorporation of electron-withdrawing (2g-2l) substituents around the pendant aromatic ring was also accommodated. Furthermore, it was found that the electronegative fluorine substituent can occupy various positions while maintaining high er. The erosion of enantioselectivity was observed with substrates possessing a trifluoromethyl, dichloro, or the strongly electronegative nitro group (2j-2l), but a fluorine substituent was tolerated at various positions (2m-n) with respect to the incipient phenoxide moiety. The electron-donating methoxy group was also accommodated, albeit with a slight decrease in enantioselectivity (2o). Additionally, the preparation of chromene 2p indicates that this system tolerates moderate substitution adjacent to the phenoxide. Without limitation to any one theory or mode of operation, the complete conversion of racemic substrates 1 to the enantioenriched chromenes indicates that a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) might be operative. Since both enantiomers of the starting material must go through a common intermediate, and the unsymmetrical 1,3-disubstituted allyl substrate precludes racemization through a palladium π-σ-π allyl rearrangement, the generation of an achiral ortho-quinone methide intermediate (4) can be proposed to account for the high levels of enantioselectivity observed for the chromene products (Scheme 1). Current understanding of the reaction contemplates subjection of either enantiomer of 1a to potassium carbonate and methanol, which rapidly produces the nucleophilic phenoxide in situ (±3, Path A). This deacylation promotes ejection of the secondary acetate to form the achiral trans o-quinone methide (o-QM, 4a). A subsequent coordination and addition of the chiral palladium complex generates the π allyl intermediate (5a) which undergoes intramolecular attack of the proximal phenoxide after bond rotation to achieve the proper conformation (6). For this pathway, the rate of o-QM formation is faster than addition of the palladium.ligand complex to ±3 (or ±1). If this is not the case, then an alternative potential pathway could be operative (Path B). This process involves the generation of diasteromeric π allyl palladium complexes (5a or 5b) from each enantiomer of 3. While one of these additions would be the “matched” case, a rapid interconversion between the diasteromeric intermediates is required so the “mismatched” complex undergoes smooth conversion to the observed enantiomer (2a) vs. the undesired isomer (ent-2a). Possible mechanisms for this involve generation of the achiral o-QM or direct addition of the palladium complex. Again, without limitation, Path A is currently favoured due to the lack of observed correlation between enantioselectivity and catalyst concentration, which disfavors Path B. Additionally, the use of bis-benzoylated substrates (vs. acetates) proceeds at the approximately the same rate with the similar levels of er and yield. It was undertaken to further elucidate the structure of the Pd(II)-L3k complex and its interaction with the bis-acetate substrate 1a. Toward that end, X-ray quality crystals of the related Pd(II) complex has been solved using ligand L3g in conjunction with 1,3-diphenyl allyl acetate as a substrate surrogate incapable of closure (Scheme 2). The structure shows that the phosphoramidite ligand L3g is coordinated to the Pd(II) center through its phosphorus center and a single aryl ring. This η2-arene stabilization results in the observed 1:1 phosphoramidite-Pd(II) complex and supports mono-coordination of a bulky ligand to the palladium. The conversion and enantiomeric ratio of the chromene product, as well as reaction rate, remained unperturbed upon a reduction in ligand loading from 8 to 4 mol % (i.e., 2:1 to 1:1 phosphoramidite:Pd). To highlight the potential of this new approach, it was thought to undertake the synthesis of catechin 8, which has demonstrated anti-staphylococcal activity due to the ability to reverse methicillin resistance in strains of drug resistant Staph. aureus. Interestingly, this catechin analog has increased activity compared to the parent (−)-epicatechin gallate, which bears additional hydroxyl groups on the catechin core (7). The regioselective hydroboration of 2a delivered chromanol 7 with 9:1 dr favoring the desired anti relationship. The esterification of chromanol 7 with tri-OBn gallic acid chloride followed by hydrogenolysis afforded 8 in 65% yield over the two steps. In a second vignette, the synthesis of hydroxyflavanone 10 was accomplished. The racemate of this compound exhibited promising levels of inhibition of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Application of the present methodology allows access to enantioenriched 10 and could facilitate improved structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. A cis-dihydroxylation of chromene 2i (94:6 er) using 3 mol % OsO4 and NMO provided 2,3-trans-3,4-phenylchromandiol (5.6:1 dr). A recrystallization of the mixture provided a single diastereomer with >99:1 er. The exposure of diol 9 to MnO2 resulted in the desired benzylic oxidation, without epimerization at C-3, to furnish 10 in 59% yield (Scheme 3). As demonstrated, the present invention provides a catalytic enantioselective method for the synthesis of 2-aryl-2H-chromenes. A ligand structure-selectivity relationship study resulted in the development of a novel monodentate phosphoramidite system that enabled the synthesis of these priviledged heterocycles with high yield and enantioselectivity. Crystallographic analysis provides mechanistic support that aryl ligand-metal interactions provide unanticipated additional rigidity in competing diasteroemeric transition states which promotes the high levels of enantioselectivity for the newly formed C—O bond. EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION The following non-limiting examples and data illustrate various aspects and features relating to the methods and compounds of the present invention, including the preparation of various 2-aryl chromene compounds, as are available through the synthetic methodologies described herein. In comparison with the prior art, the present methods and compounds provide results and data which are surprising, unexpected and contrary thereto. While the utility of this invention is illustrated through the use of several arylallyl-substituted phenoxy ester starting materials and phosphoramidite catalyst compounds and respective substituents thereon, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that comparable results are obtainable with various other starting materials, catalyst compounds and respective substituents, as are commensurate with the scope of this invention.
