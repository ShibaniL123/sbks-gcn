Example 17. Preparation of PAG-7
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1, 1-Difluoro-2-oxo-2-(1-adamantylamino)ethanesulfonyl fluoride (SM-2) (1.49 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-Hydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone (SM-4) (0.80 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (24 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −30° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 3.0 mL, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop wise to the mixture over 5 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at −30° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (24 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (72 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (24 mL) twice and brine (24 mL). The solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and then hexane (100 mL) was added to the crude material. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then the solid formed was filtrated and the solid was washed with hexane (50 mL). This solid was mostly soluble in CHCl3 (70 mL) and the remaining insoluble solid was filtrated off and the filtrate was concentrated. Hexane (100 mL) was added to the concentrate and the mixture was stirred for 1.5 hours at 40° C. and finally the hexane was separated by decantation. This procedure was repeated three more times. The obtained crude product was purified by recrystallization (hexane/CHCl3, 50° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target PAG as white solid (0.45 g) in 20.5% yield.
