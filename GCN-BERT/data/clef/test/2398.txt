Step 2: preparation of intermediate 1-tert-butyl ester 2-methyl ester (2S,4S,5S)-5-allyloxyamino-4-hydroxy-piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (2b)
To a solution of 4-tert-butyl ester 3-methyl ester (1R,4S,6S)-7-oxa-3-aza-bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane-3,4-dicarboxylate (2a) (3.88 g, 15.09 mmol) in anhydrous MeOH (30 mL) under inert atmosphere was added O-allylhydroxylamine (5.51g, 75.45 mmol). The reactor was sealed and the reaction was stirred 3 days at 80Â°C. MeOH was evaporated and the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (heptane/EtOAc 80/20 to 0/100) to provide 1-tert-butyl ester 2-methyl ester (2S,4S,5S)-5-allyloxyamino-4-hydroxy-piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (2b) (3.12 g, 9.44 mmol, 62%) as a colorless oil.
