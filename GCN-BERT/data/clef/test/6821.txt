[Step 5] Synthesis of compound 11418
N-(3-fluorophenyl)-N-((5-(hydrazinecarbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)-1-methylpiperidine-4-carboxamide (0.200 g, 0.519 mmol), synthesized in step 4, and triethylamine (0.145 mL, 1.038 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (13 mL), and 2,2-difluoroacetic anhydride (0.085 mL, 0.778 mmol) was added to the solution at room temperature. The reaction solution was heated under reflux for 12 hours, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The extract was filtered through a plastic filter to remove the solid residue and the aqueous layer, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; methanol/dichloromethane = from 0% to 15%) and concentrated, and then the obtained material was further purified by chromatography (SiO2 plate, 20 x 20 x 1 mm; methanol/dichloromethane = 10 %) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.015 g, 6.5%) as a white solid.
