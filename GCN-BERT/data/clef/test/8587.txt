WATER WITH LOW DEUTERIUM CONTENT FOR THE DIETARY PREVENTION OF STROKE Field of the Invention [0001] The present invention is in the field of food industry and healthcare. More specifically, the present invention relates to water with reduced deuterium content for use in the dietary prevention of stroke. Background of the invention [0002] A stroke is a cerebrovascular event that occurs when a part of the brain is deprived of blood supply. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain or an artery to the brain and accounts for more than 80% of all strokes. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs upon breaking a blood vessel in the brain and accompanied with bleeding in the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. According to World Health Organization data, stroke is the second leading cause of death above the age of 60 years, and the fifth leading cause in people aged 15 to 59 years old. Treatment of stroke has a limited efficiency, if a stroke victim is treated emergently within 3 to 6 hours. Delaying treatment makes it in many cases impossible to treat. By data of National Stroke Association (USA), 24% of women and 42% of men have an incidence of another (recurrent) stroke within five years of a first stroke. Therefore, the prevention of recurrent stroke is a key concern in managing the stroke. Thus, there is a great need in safe and effective approaches to the prevention of stroke. [0003] Water is an essential nutrient. The natural water is a composition of nine water isotopologues (1H2160, 1H2170, 1H2180, 1H1602H, 1H1702H, 1H1802H, 2H2160, 2H2170, 2H2180) formed by stable isotopes of hydrogen 1H (protium) and 2H (deuterium) and oxygen (160, 170, and 180), wherein content of major water isotopologue 1H2160 (herein referred to as H20) is 99.7317 molecular % (mol.%). The deuterium content in water samples can be measured by isotope mass-spectrometry and expressed as deuterium/protium ratio R= H/1H, in ppm units, where H is the number of deuterium atoms, and 1H is the number of protium atoms. The deuterium content in ocean water is 155 ppm (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water 2, VSMOW2). The extremely low deuterium content of 89 ppm was found in water samples of unpopulated area in Antarctica (Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation 2, SLAP2). The deuterium is distributed between isotopologues as follows: 99.74% of deuterium forms the isotopologue 1H1602H and the rest of deuterium (0.26%) forms isotopologues H 802H, 1H1702H, 2H2160, 2H2170, and 2H2180.

The deuterium content in environmental water varies systematically across the continents due to isotopic fractionation accompanying the transport of water vapor from the ocean to the land. Kendall et al, Distribution of oxygen -18 and deuterium in river waters across the United States, Hydrol. Processes, 2001, 15(7):1363-1393. Local tap waters have the same deuterium content as its local sources, e.g. rivers, lakes, and etc. Bowen et al., Stable isotope ratios of tap water in the contiguous USA. Water Resour. Res., 2007, 43, W03419. It has been demonstrated that the deuterium content of local tap water is a reasonable proxy for consumer's fluid intake. Chesson et al., Links between purchase location and stable isotope ratios of bottled water, soda, and beer in the United States. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010, 58, 7311-7316. Given that a vast majority of people reside at places where deuterium content in tap water varies from 140 to 155 ppm, these people systematically consume fluids (drinking water, food, and beverages) having deuterium content within the range from 140 to 155 ppm. Given that the adequate intake for total water was 3.7 and 2.7 liters per day for men and women, respectively (Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2005, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services), people continuously consume deuterium-containing isotopologues as the obligate nutrient in amounts no less than 0.8-1.0 ml per subject per day. [0004] We surprisingly found that deuterium-containing isotopologues are highly undesirable nutrients for people at risk of stroke and restriction of consumption of these isotopologues may represent a special medically determined nutrient requirement, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone. Thus, a restriction of daily consumption of the deuterium-containing isotopologues with drinking represents a novel approach to the dietary prevention of stroke. [0005] It is an object of the present invention is to provide a water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm for use in the dietary prevention of stroke. [0006] It is an object of the present invention is to provide a method of the dietary prevention of stroke comprising a step of administering to a subject in need thereof a water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm. Brief Description of the Drawing Figure 1 shows the dependence of the percentage of adults aged 18 or older with diagnosed stroke ("Stroke incidence, %") on the deuterium content ("Deuterium content, ppm") in drinking water. Figure 2 shows the scheme of the process for preparing water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm. Detailed Description of the Invention [0007] The present invention provides a water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm for use in the dietary prevention of stroke. [0008] Further, the present invention provides a method of the dietary prevention of stroke comprising a step of administering to a subject in need thereof water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm. [0009] In preferred embodiments of the invention, the deuterium content in the water is from 90 to 139 ppm. [0010] In preferred embodiments of the invention, the water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm is prepared by a process comprising a step of reducing the deuterium content in the natural water. A vacuum distillation of natural water is a non-exclusive example of well-known industrial process, which reduces the deuterium content in the natural water. [0011] As used herein, the term "deuterium content" refers to the amount of deuterium incorporated in water and expressed as deuterium/protium ratio R=2H/1H, in ppm units, where 2H is the number of deuterium atoms, and 1H is the number of hydrogen atoms. The deuterium content can be measured by isotope mass-spectrometry. [0012] As used herein, the term "water" refers to a composition of isotopologues formed by stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, wherein the isotopes of hydrogen are 1H (protium) and 2H (deuterium), and wherein the isotopes of oxygen are 160, 170, and 180. [0013] As used herein, the term "isotopologue" is in accordance with lUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology 2nd Edition (1997) and refers to a molecular entity that differs only in isotopic composition (number of isotopic substitutions). Examples of water isotopologues include 1 H2160, 1H2170, 1H2180, 1H1602H, 1H1702H, H180 H, 2H2160, 2H2170, 2H2180. [0014] In practicing the invention, water with the deuterium content of 1 to 139 ppm may contain protium-containing isotopologues at levels of 99.700<1H216O<99.999 molecular %, 0.000<1H217O<0.050 molecular %, and 0.000<1H28O< 0.250 molecular %. [0015] As used herein, the term "stroke" refers to a cerebrovascular event occurring when a part of the brain is deprived of blood supply. Such cerebrovascular events include, but are not limited to, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and mini-stroke known as transient ischemic attack. [0016] In some preferred embodiment of the invention, water with the deuterium content of 1 to 139 ppm is used for the dietary management of stroke to prevent a recurrent stroke. [0017] As used herein, the term "recurrent stroke" refers to another stroke occurring in the same subject after a first stroke. [0018] As used herein, the term "prevention" refers to prophylactic administration of water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm to a subject at risk of stroke to prevent the stroke onset. [0019] In preferred embodiments of the invention, water with the deuterium content of 1 to 139 ppm is a component of a food composition. [0020] In preferred embodiments of the invention, the food composition is selected from the group consisting of medical food, nutritional supplement, and beverage. [0021] As used herein, the term "medical food" refers to a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary prevention of stroke. [0022] The medical food of the invention may be prepared by well-known procedures using well-known optional ingredients. Such optional ingredients generally are used individually at levels from about 0.0005% to about 10.0%, preferably from about 0.005% to about 1.0% by weight of the composition. Examples of suitable optional ingredients include, but are not limited to, buffers, sweeteners, colorants, carriers, and etc. [0023] In practicing the invention, the medical food is specially formulated and processed as a drink product. Such drink products include, but are not limited to, drinking water, beverage, and liquid food. The liquid medical food may be prepared by saturation of water with the deuterium content of 1 to 139 ppm by carbon dioxide or/and inorganic salts typically abandoned in natural drinking water. The examples of such salts include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, etc. [0024] In practicing the invention, the medical food can be administered orally for a period of one day or longer and in amounts as prescribed by a physician which manages the diet and/or provides medical supervision. [0025] In practicing the invention, the medical food can be administered in amounts from 0.01 to 4.0 liters per subject per day. [0026] As used herein, the term "subject" refers to any mammal. Preferably, the subject is a human. Other nonexclusive examples of such subjects include, but are not limited to, dog, cat, and horse. [0027] The following examples are presented to demonstrate the invention. The examples are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Example 1 [0028] This example demonstrates that water with low deuterium content is useful for the dietary prevention of stroke. The percentage of US adults aged 18 or older with diagnosed stroke for each state across US was obtained from the report of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prevalence of Stroke - United States, 2010. MMWR; 2012, 61(20); pp. 379-382. The deuterium contents of tap water across the US were obtained from Bowen GJ et al, (2007), Stable isotope ratios of tap water in the contiguous United States, Water Resour. Res., 43, W03419. We performed the correlation analysis and found that there is a significant positive correlation (Pearson's r=0.53; p<0.0005) between deuterium content in the water and the percentage of people with diagnosed stroke. Figure 1 shows that percentage of people with diagnosed stroke is increased by 0.06% per each 1 ppm of increase in deuterium content in the drinking water. This result evidently suggests that water with deuterium content 1 <2H/1H<139 ppm is useful for the dietary prevention of stroke. Further, we calculated the average percentage of people with diagnosed stroke among consumers of either water with deuterium content 89<2H/1 H<139 ppm or water with deuterium content 150<2H/1 H<155 ppm. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA. Data are presented in Table 1 as percentage mean + SEM of people with diagnosed stroke ("Incidence rate of stroke, %"). Table 1 'Differs significantly from group 150<WH<155 (p<0.001). Table 1 shows that consumption of water with deuterium content 139 ppm and less significantly reduces incidence rate of stroke. Thus, the water with deuterium content 139 ppm and less is useful for the dietary prevention of stroke. Example 2 [0029] This example demonstrates process for preparation of water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm. The reducing deuterium content in a natural water includes steps as follows (Figure 2): evaporating the natural water with deuterium content of C1 (150 ppm) in boiling means 1 at 60°C and pressure 0.2 bars to produce water vapor; supplying the water vapor to the bottom 2 of distillation column 3; carrying out vapor-liquid contact between a descending liquid and an ascending vapor mainly on the surface of the packing 4 within the distillation column; condensing water vapor with reduced deuterium content (C2) on condenser 5 installed on upper bound of the distillation column 3; and collecting a part of condensate as condensed water with reduced deuterium content of C2 (C2<C1). Finally, water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm is prepared by mixing the water with reduced deuterium content (C2) and the natural water (C1) in certain proportions. The deuterium content in resulting water is measured by isotope mass-spectrometry and expressed as deuterium/protium ratio R=2H/1H, where 2H is the number of deuterium atoms and 1H is the number of hydrogen atoms. Example 3 [0030] This example demonstrates the use of water with deuterium content from 1 to 139 ppm for preparing medical food for the dietary prevention of stroke (Table 2).
