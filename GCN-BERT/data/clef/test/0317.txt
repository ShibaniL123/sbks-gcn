The sixth step
To a solution of Compound 78 (10.9g, 25.0mmol) in dichloromethane (110 mL) was added N-bromosuccinimide (4.90 g, 27.5 mmol), and the mixture was stirred under ice cooling for 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform after addition of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield compound 79 (6.10g, yield 47%).
