3. PREAMBLE TO THE DISCRETION a. Background: Rice is one of the most staple foods in the world. Half of the world depends on rice for their daily calorie intake. We consume white rice which is completely polished rice and this does not have the required quantity of nutrition (i.e. micro nutrients, phyto-nutrients, minerals, vitamins, protein, and complex carbohydrates). It is known that unpolished rice is much more nutrient and hence is healthier than fully polished rice. Unpolished rice / partially milled brown rice has some major advantages of over white rice. It has 20% more protein, 4 times more total lipid, 600 % more dietary fiber. It is also rich in minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus etc) and in vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6 and vitamin E). By consuming this partially milled/ unpolished rice because of the complex carbohydrates and digestible fibers present in the rice kernel the digestion is very slow there by it get digested very slow due to which all the nutrients present in the rice kernel will get absorbed in to the body system there by helping the body get use of this much needed nutrients. But unpolished rice has very poor shelf life, it gets deteriorated very fast as the “PEST”, present in the unpolished rice, is damaged by a number of pests, like (a) rice weevil, (b) lesser grain borer, (c) khapra beetle, (d) saw toothed grain beetle, (e) red rust/ confused flour beetle, (f) tropical ware mouse moth and (g) rice moth. These pests, both in larvae (young) and adult condition, penetrate the grains and feed on them and makes the grain warm and moist. This leads to mould formation, thereby, rice gets spoiled in a matter of a few days. At present, there are two methods to prevent this spoiling of rice - (a) Prophylactic treatment (fumigation) and (b) Curative treatment. Prophylactic treatment involves spraying of insecticides, like malathion, DDVP and deltamethrin, in suitable dosages and this treatment used to prevent infestation in the godown (storage area) itself. Curative treatment involves use of aluminum phosphide, available in tablet form, in suitable dosage and covering the stock in polythene plastic in air tight condition. However these existing practices will cure only infested larvae/ adult, but will not destroy the egg cells present in the stock. All egg cell are contaminated at the farm level only. As a result, shelf life is limited to a few days only. At present, there is no known technology to preserve the unpolished rice. b. Object of invention: Object of the present invention is to cure 100 % infestation of this unpolished / partially milled brown rice and increase the shelf life up to one year. c. Statement of invention: Normally, the shelf life of unpolished / partially milled brown rice (which contains all the nutrients) is about two weeks. In this invention, a novel method of irradiation is used to increase the shelf life this brown rice to about one year, thereby, preserve the all the nutrient qualities of unpolished rice for entire period of shelf life. d. Summary of invention: Raw paddy is heated at a temperature below 60 deg C, cooled room temperature by blowing air, kept at this temperature for about 12 hours, cleaned, destoned and dehusked in suitable machines. Further, the resulting brown rice is lightly polished (primary polishing) just to loosen the kernel of rice grains), sieved and graded. This brown rice is subject to gamma irradiation of intensity less than 1000 Gray, using Cobalt-60 as radiation source. This irradiated brown rice has a shelf life of about one year, leading to preservation of all nutrient qualities of brown rice for entire shelf life. COMPLETE SPECIFICATION The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it to be performed. a. Description of the drawings: Entire process can be understood with the help of accompanying drawings which are as follows: Fig-1 shows the block diagram of the equipment used for irradiation process Fig-2 shows the flow diagram of the entire process Paddy is dried at a controlled temperature, dehusked in a machine, destoned, graded and subject to partial milling (primary polishing). This results in partially milled brown rice / unpolished rice. This partially milled brown rice / unpolished rice is then irradiated in a commercially available irradiation equipment. The details of the process are described more clearly with the help of drawings (fig-1 and fig-2). b. Irradiation process Irradiation is a process in which food products (grains, vegetables etc) are exposed to radiation for a certain duration. Radiation is given by the source called ‘cobalt-60’. The dose of irradiation is usually measured in a unit called ‘gray’, abbreviated by ‘Gy’ (1 Kilo Gray = 1000 Gray), which is a measure of the amount of energy transferred to the foods, microbe or other substance being irradiated. These substances give off high energy photons, called gamma rays, will not give off neutrons which mean they will not make any thing around them radioactive. That means that, by irradiation process, the food product also will not become radioactive. Food products are irradiated by gamma radiation. During the process, the energy from the rays is transferred to the water and other molecules in the microbes of pests. The energy creates transient reactive chemicals that damage DNA in the microbes of the pests causing defects in genetics thereby it will die when it tries to grow and reproduced itself. The quantity of DNA is main factor. Parasites, paste, insects, have large amount of DNA are rapidly killed by very low dose of irradiation. The killing effect of irradiation process on microbes is measured in the D values. One unit of D is the amount of irradiation needed to kill 90 % of that organism. After the irradiation process, disease causing germs are reduced / eliminated and nutritional values are totally retained. After irradiation process, the irradiated food product will have to be labeled with “RADURA” logo on the packaged material. Irradiated food products are is stored, handled, and cooked in the same way as non-irradiated materials. The safety of irradiated food products has been studied by feeding them to animals and to people, this extensive studies include animal feeding studies lasting for several generations in different species, including mice, rates & dogs. The safety of the irradiated foods has been endorsed by World Health Organization (WHO), Government of India and Food & Drugs Administration (FDA). c. Irradiation equipment: Fig-1 shows diagram of irradiation plant and its various components [parts (a) to (g)]. For reasons of safety, Cobalt-60 irradiator (c), the source of gamma rays, when not being used, stored underground in a water jacket (d). Before the material movement is started, irradiator is lifted from the underground water jacket. Once the source is lifted from the water, it starts emitting high energy radiation. Here water act as an insulator. The entire irradiation unit (source of irradiation, most of the material handling unit) is surrounded by three meter thick concrete wall (g). The material to be irradiated is packed in gunny / plastic bags and is brought loading bay (a). The material is loaded into the moving material handling cage (b). These cages are moving continuously over the rail (f) in a guided path (e), at a speed depending on the rate of irradiation, around the source of irradiation (as shown in the diagram). After the completion of one cycle, the cages come out to unloading area (b) where the material is taken out. The irradiated material is analyzed for dose mapping. If irradiation not found enough, it is again loaded back in the loading department. An identification label sticker is put on all the packages (bags) of irradiated material. The label also contains information on the date of irradiation, amount of radiation given, name of the irradiating plant, name of the material, name of the manufacturer etc. d. Steps involved in irradiation process of partially milled / unpolished rice: Various steps [steps (a) to (k) shown in flowchart] involved in converting paddy to partially milled / unpolished rice and further irradiation process are shown in flowchart (Fig-2) and further described in detail herein: (1) Paddy [input (a)] is dried in paddy drier (b) in the temperature range of 40 to 65° centigrade. Further increase in drying temperature will cause loss of all the antioxidants present in the rice kernel. Paddy is cooled (c) by blowing the cold air and held for about 12 hours (d), i.e., normally kept overnight. This will help to maintain the moisture content of the paddy. Paddy passing through paddy cleaner and destoner (e). This will clean the paddy and remove the stones in the paddy. Then the paddy is passed through rubber Sheller dehusking machine (f) so that upper covering called husk is removed and then through paddy separator (g) (in as many passes as required) so that the paddy and the brown rice are separated (g). Brown rice, so obtained, is now passed through the primary polisher (h) where the outer layer is just loosened. This improves the cookability of brown rice. This is an important property, required by the people, for acceptance of brown rice for routine use. Brown rice is further passed through the sieve separator and grading machine (i) for separation of broken rice and other contaminants. After the gradation, this partially milled /unpolished rice is packed in polythene bags of required size and weight (j). These packed partially milled/ unpolished rice is transported to the nearest food irradiation center for irradiation treatment (k) The brown rice is irradiated (1) at up to 1 kilo gray (unit of irradiation). Irradiation done uniformly throughout the entire content of brown rice in the container (cage). This is ensured by taking many samples from different locations in the cage and conducting dosimetry test. If found not uniform, the process of irradiation is repeated. Uniform irradiation will kill all the pest, along with egg cells, and resultant rice kernels will have much longer shelf life. The shelf life is expected to be about one year. And there will not be any hatching and infestation even webbing in the unpolished rice partially milled brown rice. The irradiated rice is stored, handled and shipped (m). This irradiated rice can be cooked in the same way as the normal rice. claim, .
