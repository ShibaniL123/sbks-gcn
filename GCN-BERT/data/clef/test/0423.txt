Candle Technical Field The present invention relates to a candle and specifically to a multi-part olfactory candle. An olfactory candle will be understood, in the context of an invention described herein, to refer to a candle that releases a smell or smells as it burns. Background of the Invention Consumer demand for candle products has and continues to increase. Candles are now not only used as a source of light but also more frequently as a source of smell. This can be for hygienic or medical reasons such as alternative medicines or the like. Frequently candles are used in the domestic environment to provide the user with a pleasant smell throughout the home as an example. Conventional candles comprise a simple elongate cylindrical wax body with a coaxial wick running through along the center thereof. The wick is lit and the candle wax slowly burns until the wax has been consumed and the flame extinguished. More recent candles are however far more varied in shape and size and this presents a number of problems. The inventor has established that there is a desire within the market for a customer experience in which the customer is able to construct their own personalised or bespoke candle. This might for example be for gifts or the like. In such an arrangement a customer could select their candle components from a range of different scents according to their own taste. This could be in a shop or via a website. The customer can then construct an individual scent or olfactory combination candle which has not been possible before. However, the inventor has also established that there are technical complications and difficulties of burning such a multi-component candle. An invention described herein addresses these technical problems to allow a multi-scent candle experience to be realised in the commercial environment. Technical problems arise in particular if a candle formed of two different parts for example two different waxes is contemplated. Forming a single candle of two different waxes poses problems with respect to locating the two wax parts with respect to each other and ensuring both waxes burn, in particular in the region of transfer from one wax to the other. One problem is concerned with the phenomenon of 'pillaring' in candles which are themselves formed within a container, such as a glass jar, cup or the like. Candle pillaring occurs when only a portion of the candle wax melts, resulting in an open hole or pillar extending along and within the candle. The pillar follows the path of the wick. This is a particular problem when contemplating a candle formed of two waxes. Candle pillaring results in inefficient use of the candle wax since not all of the wax is consumed. It is not then possible to ignite the remaining wax which is of course wasteful and also unattractive. Furthermore, pillaring can cause a build-up of molten wax within the hole which can extinguish the flame and requiring the user to repeatedly re-light the candle. Alternatively the build-up of molten wax can flood the wick such that it is not possible to relight the candle as wax covers the wick. This problem is particularly prevalent with candles having wide diameters where the outer wax on the periphery of the candle is remote from the hot flame. The present invention solves these and other issues with existing candles and additionally provides other technical and commercially advantageous features. Summary Aspects of the invention are defined in the accompanying claims. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a candle including a first wax portion and a second wax portion, wherein at least some of the first wax portion is located in use in a recess formed in the second wax portion, and wherein a region of the first wax portion is arranged to extend radially with respect to the recess and is arranged to overlap at least a portion of said second wax portion around the recess formed therein. Advantageously a region of the first wax portion extends away from the centre of the first wax portion in a radial direction. The skilled person will understand that the term "radially" does not limit the first wax portion to a circular shape but instead covers all shapes and defines that a region of the first wax portion extends outwardly from the recess in the second wax portion (in a direction perpendicular to the elongate axis of the candle). The arrangement of the region extending to overlap a portion of the second wax portion advantageously provides a continuous surface area at the top of the candle, this helps to prevent pillaring of the candle as it burns. The overlapping portion also provides a large surface area of contact between the two wax portions and thus assists in locating the two wax portions together. This radially extending region also facilitates a uniform burn of the candle and allows the two wax portions to blend together. Thus optimal use of the wax is achieved. Advantageously the region of the first wax portion extending radially with respect to the recess may be in the form of a plate arranged to cover substantially all of an upper surface of the second wax portion. This provides a greater surface area for adhesion between two wax portions. The skilled person will appreciate that the term "plate" does not impose any specific limitations on the size or shape of the radially extending portion. Instead this term is used simply to define that the radially extending portion is wider than the recess in the second wax portion. The part of the first wax portion that is located in the recess of the second wax portion may be thicker than the plate. Thus the height of the recess may be greater than the height of the region of the first wax portion that extends radially outwards from the recess. The additional height of the recess allows the first wax portion to securely locate in the second wax portion thus providing a more secure connection between the two wax portions. The recess may extend through the second wax portion such that the part of the first wax portion located in the recess of the second wax portion fills the recess. Additionally the recess may extend through the entire length of the second wax portion. Thus the recess and the part of the first wax portion located in the recess have complimentary shapes resulting in a complete and secure location. This advantageously reduces the likelihood of the candle falling apart for example during transportation. The first wax portion may be selectively removable from the second wax portion before use. Advantageously the first and second wax portions can therefore be stored and/or located separately before assembly. The plate may be integral to the part of the first wax portion extending into the recess. Alternatively the plate may be separate to the part of the first wax portion extending into the recess. The part of the first wax portion that extends into the recess may taper from a first cross sectional area adjacent to the plate portion to a second cross sectional area distal to the plate portion, wherein the first cross sectional area is greater than the second cross sectional area. The recess may have a frustoconical shape and the part of the first wax portion that extends into the recess may have a corresponding shape to receive said frustoconical shape. The taper of the first wax portion provides for ease of location between the first wax portion and the second wax portion. At least one of the first wax portion and the second wax portion may include an olfactory component. The first wax portion may have a first olfactory component and the second wax portion may have a second olfactory component different to the first olfactory component. Thus a scented candle may be provided that releases a unique blend of two smells. The first wax portion may have a first colour and the second wax portion may have a second colour different to the first colour. Thus a two-coloured candle may be provided in which a mix of the different colours changes over time as the candle burns. The recess may be located centrally in the second wax portion. This location allows the two waxes to mix during burn. This is particularly important when the two waxes have two different smells since the two scents are designed to mix together as the candle burns. The candle may be provided in a container. The container may comprise a semi- translucent material. The container may be formed of glass or ceramic. Alternatively the container may be formed of wax, wherein the wax of the container has a higher melting point than the first and second wax portions of the candle. The candle may further include a third wax portion located between the first and second wax portions. Thus a three part candle may be provided. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a separable two piece candle kit including a first component and a second component wherein the first component is insertable into the second component. The first and second component may be formed of wax and wherein the wax of the first component is different to the wax of the second component. The difference in the wax components may be a difference in an olfactory additive. Thus a kit to make a two part scented candle may be provided. This provides advantages in terms of an enhanced sensory experience. According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a method of forming a two piece candle including the steps of: selecting a first wax component comprising a first scent and a second wax component comprising a second scent; assembling the first wax component into the second component and locating a wick through the candle. The step of assembling the first wax component into the second wax component may include: heating the outer surface of the first wax component; and locating the first wax component in the second wax component such that adhesion between the surface of the first wax portion and the surface of the second wax portion locates the two components together. According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a kit of parts including a plurality of first candle members each having a first olfactory component and a plurality of second candle members having a second olfactory component different to the first. According to a fifth aspect of the invention there is provided a two part candle including: a first wax portion, the first wax portion comprising a first elongate component and a second component arranged perpendicular to the elongate component; and a second wax portion, wherein the first wax portion is arranged in use such that the second component of the first wax portion is arranged to contact an opposing face of the second wax portion such that in use adhesion between the surfaces locates the first wax portion in the second portion. According to a sixth aspect of the invention there is provided a two-part candle including: a container; a first element comprising a disc having substantially the same cross- section as the container and a protrusion having a cross sectional area smaller than the disc extending away from the disc; wherein the protrusion tapers from a first larger cross sectional area adjacent the disc to a second smaller cross sectional area distal to the disc; a second ring shaped element wherein the thickness of the ring tapers from a first smaller cross sectional area to a second larger cross sectional area and a hole in the ring correspondingly tapers from a first larger cross sectional area to a second smaller cross sectional area; wherein the first element and the second ring shaped element locate together such that the protrusion of the first element locates in the hole of the ring shaped element and the resulting assembly is provided in the container. Detailed Description of the Drawings The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the following drawings in which: Figure 1 illustrates a two part candle. Figure 2 illustrates the first portion of the two part candle in Figure 1 Figure 3A illustrates a side view of the second portion of the two part candle in Figure 1 Figure 3B illustrates a top view of the second portion of the two part candle in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a graph illustrating the change in scent released over the time the candle has been burning Figure 5 illustrates a three part candle In the Figures like parts are depicted by like reference numerals While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments are shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description of the specific embodiments are not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed. On the contrary, the invention is covering all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Detailed Description A two part candle that provides flexibility for the customer is shown in Figure 1. The candle sits in a container (1) that in the example shown is a cylindrical shape but may be any other shape provided a candle can be located within it. The candle itself includes a first portion (3) and a second portion (2). A wick (10) is provided in the first portion (3). As shown in Figure 1 the first portion (3) and the second portion (2) locate with one another and together make up the candle. Figure 2 illustrates the first portion (3) of the candle. The first portion (3) is made of wax and is formed of a truncated cone (3A) and a top plate (3B). The diameter of the top plate (3B) is larger than the diameter of the truncated cone (3B) and shaped such that the top plate (3B) covers most of the top of the candle when the first portion (3) is located within the second portion (2). The depth of the top plate (3B) is smaller than the height of the truncated cone (3A) and typically measures approximately 7mm. The truncated cone (3A) is the same height as the final height of the candle and typically measures approximately 64mm. A wick (10) is provided through the centre of the first portion (3). The wick (10) extends through the truncated cone (3A) and the top plate (3B) and extends out of the top of the top plate (3B) by a few millimetres, typically 5-10mm, to provide a length of wick in order to light the candle. Figures 3A and 3B illustrate side and plan views respectively of the second portion of the candle within the container. The second portion (2) is made of wax and is shaped such that the outside of the second portion is the same shape as the interior of the container (1). Thus the second portion fits into the base of the container (1). A recess (2A) is provided in the centre of the second portion (2). The recess (2A) is the same size and shape as the truncated cone (3A) of the first portion (3). When the candle is assembled as illustrated in Figure 1 , the first portion (3) locates in the recess (2A) such that the outer surface of the truncated cone (3A) contacts the inner surface of the recess (2A). The truncated cone shape facilitates location and assembly of the first portion (3) and the second portion (2). This is important since if the first portion (3) and the second portion (2) are not correctly located, the candle will not bum efficiently or effectively leading to wasted wax. The top plate (3B) of the first portion (3) locates on top of the top of the second portion (2) such that the top plate (3B) covers most of the second portion (2). The arrangement of the top plate (3B) finalizes the location of the first portion (3) and ensures that in the event of any contraction of the wax the two portions remain located together such that the entire candle burns uniformly. This arrangement also helps to prevent "pillaring" of the candle. "Pillaring" can occur in candles of lesser technical quality where the wax next to the wick melts flooding the wick and snuffing out the candle. Thus the candle does not last for as long as it should do. Pillaring is a particular problem when a candle that offers the consumer choice of, for example, colours or scents is contemplated. This is because if the connection between the different parts of the candle is not good enough only part of the candle will melt resulting in pillaring. The present invention as discussed above advantageously prevents these problems and provides a high quality candle that burns fully and completely. As discussed above the arrangement of the first portion (3) and the second portion (2) provides a high quality candle formed of two parts thus enabling flexibility and consumer selection. For example the two portions of the candle may be different colours, alternatively the two portions of the candle may have different scents or only one of the first and second portions may be scented. The uniform burning of the candle is particularly important if the two portions of the candle have different properties. Figure 4 is a graph illustrating the change in scent released over time for a candle in which the first and second wax portions have two different scents. As can be clearly seen, when the candle is first lit the scent of the first wax portion dominates with no contribution of scent from the second wax portion. As the candle burns, once the top plate has been consumed, due to the tapered shape of the recess and the truncated cone section, the contribution of scent from the first wax portion reduces, with the contribution of scent from the second wax portion increasing. As the candle burns the contribution from the first wax portion gradually reduces and the contribution of scent from the second wax portion increases. This provides significant advantages for people whose sight is impaired since they can tell how far the candle has burned from the ratio of the two scents alone. Figure 5 illustrates a three part candle. This candle includes a first portion (3) and a second portion (2) and additionally a third portion (4) arranged between the first portion (3) and the second portion (2). The third portion (4), like the first portion (3) includes a truncated cone section to locate and finalise the position of the third portion (4) in the candle. The third portion (4) may also include a plate portion to assist in the final location of the candle. In the third portion (4) the truncated cone section is hollow to allow the first portion (3) to locate within the third portion (4). Thus a candle is provided that includes three different portions. In the examples described above the first portion (3) is described as including a truncated cone section. However the present invention is not limited solely to this shape. Indeed the recess in the second portion (2) and the first portion (3) can be any shape. Advantageously the recess and the section of the first portion that extends away from the top plate tapers from a first width at the top of the candle to a second smaller width at the bottom of the candle in order to locate the first portion (3) in the second portion (2) or the third portion (4). A method of assembling the candle will now be described. Once the different parts of the candle have been selected the candle must be assembled. In one embodiment the second portion is supplied already located in the container. Alternatively the second portion is inserted into the container. In order to assist with keeping the second portion in the container the outer surface of the second portion may be gently heated before the second portion is inserted into the container. Once the second wax portion is inserted into the container the first wax portion is then inserted and located in the second wax portion. . To assist with the retention of the first wax portion in the second wax portion the outer surface of the first wax portion may be gently heated and then inserted into the second wax portion. Whilst in the examples above the candle is provided in a container (1), the candle may alternatively be a non-container candle. In such an example the candle is formed in the way described above but the container (1) is not included.
