DESCRIPTION Titled: Â« SWI SUIT FOR INCONTINENCE OR ESTRUAL CYCLE AND METHOD OF MAKING On behalf GIOIA FIORILLO of Italian nationality, F.C. FRL GIO 71B61 F839P, resident in Via Antonio Stoppani , 34 - 00197 Rome, Italy. Inventor: FIORILLO Gioia Request No Lodged * * * * * Technical Field: the current invention refers in general to the category of women's clothing and in particular a female swimsuit that may be used in cases of incontinence or during the menstrual cycle. It provides the housing of an external absorbent pad with wings in a specific internal layer of the swimsuit so that it renders the absorbent pad invisible from outside of the garment with the internal layer fitting snugly and comfortably, and the method to make it. Background Art Existing women's swimsuits on market are made in such a way that they expose women to the risk of leakage, during the menstrual cycle or in the case of incontinence, the risk of visi- bility of the presence of an absorbent pad from the outside of the garment . On market there are three kinds of absorbent pads: internal, external with wings, external without wings. Only the internal (tampons) and the external without wings may be used, as they are not visible when worn with a swim- suit . Not all the women like to use internal absorbent pads (tampons) because, whilst they are the only type that are invisible, they prove annoying for some. The external without wings are secured with an adhesive tape on the inside the swimsuit. This kind of absorbent pad is often not well secured and, when not in proper positioning, may become visible. It may also become thickened and wrinkled and cause discomfort around the groin and between the legs. The external absorbent pad with wings can't be worn with a swimsuit because the wings will be visible from the outside. To overcome this problem women often wear shorts over the swimsuit, however the shorts are often of a different design and are not esthetically pleasing. Using two items of clothing in swimming places is cumbersome and not functional . Men's swimsuits characterized with internal netting at waist level could be technically considered similar to the present invention however they cannot be deemed to have the same func- tion. In essence neither the material nor the shape of men's swimsuits, if used by women, could allow the correct positioning for an absorbent pad and the right fit for a female body. Purpose and Summary of the Invention: The scope of the present invention is to introduce a swimsuit (bikini briefs) that allows the application of an absorbent pad with wings eliminating all the inconveniences described above. The swimsuit will allow women the freedom to move comfortably on the beach, at the seaside and in all the places where one wears a swimsuit (pool, gym, etc.), wearing the ex- ternal absorbent pad with wings being invisible from the outside, feeling its perfect fit molded to their body and appearing aesthetically perfect without needing to wear a second garment covering the swimsuit and the visible parts of an absorbent pad with wings. These results are obtainable with a swimsuit (bikini briefs) of any shape and any fabric or adequate material that is produced in two layers joined with one seam of stitching at the pelvis level where the internal layer will permit the housing of the external absorbent pad with wings without it being visible from outside. Brief Description of Drawings: More details of the invention will be made clear from the continuation of the description made with reference to the attached, indicative and not restrictive, pattern, in which: - the fig. 1 shows the front view of the external layer of the finished garment: therefore normal swimsuit. - the fig. 2 shows the rear view of the external layer of the finished garment . - the fig. 3 shows: A. the internal layer, invisible one time the swimsuit has been worn, that is used for housing of an absorbent pad with wings; B. the stitching that joins the two layers; C. visible external part of the swimsuit; D. the housing for external absorbent pad with wings. - the fig.4 shows a view of the garment and its components in vertical section: A. the lining of the absorbent pad with wings; B. the stitching joining the two layers; C. visible external part of the swimsuit; D. the housing for the external absorbent pad with wings . - the fig.5 shows the swimsuit that has been worn after that the absorbent has been housed on the internal layer and the latter has been placed in the external layer. Detailed Description of the Invention Referring to the abovementioned drawings the invented swimming suit, completely represented in the fig. 4, could be used in the cases described above. The invented swimming suit, as in the fig. 4, is formed by a first external layer (fig. 4 lett . C) joined to a second in- ternal layer (fig. 4 lett . A) through a single stitching at the pelvis level (fig. 4 lett. B) . The first element, the external one (fig. 4 lett. C) , is composed of a traditional swimsuit sewed with any suitable mate- rial . The internal element (fig. 4 lett. A), instead, has a shape suitable to house the absorbent pad with wings that could be folded on this layer (fig. 4 lett. D) without being visible from outside. The external layer has slightly reduced dimen- sion respect at the external layer ad it is stitched up at the external element through a single stitching in the upper part (fig. 4 lett . B) . Therefore the elements will be separated each one from the other except for the part corresponding at the waistline of the swimsuit (fig. 4 lett. B) . Once that the absorbent pad with wings has been housed in the internal layer, this one will be positioned inside the external layer. 1) Swimsuit for incontinence or menstrual cycle made up of: - one extarnale layer (fig. 4 lett. C) ; - one internal layer (fig. 4 lett. A) in the same shape as the external one but in a slightly smaller size and that is only joined with the external one at the waistline; - one seam joining the two layers. 2) swimsuit as claimed in claim 1) where the two layers are completely separate from each other except for the part at the waistline. 3) swimsuit as claimed in claims 1) and 2) that permits the housing of an external absorbent pad with wings in the internal layer so that the wings of the absorbent pad are able to be folded up onto the internal layer and allowing this layer, to contour to the body when it is first worn. 4) swimsuit as claimed in claims 1), 2) and 3) that permits at the internal layer housing the absorbent with wings (fig. 4 lett. D) to be housed inside the external layer and without being visible externally.
