Step 3
To Compound 143 (500 mg, 0.972 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) solution was added triethylamine (0.202 mL, 1.457 mmol) and N-phenyl-bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide) (451 mg, 1.263 mmol), the mixture was stirred under ice-cooling for 10 minutes. Water was added thereto, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 144 (567 mg, 90% yield) as yellow foam.
