Step 5: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl 2,7-dioxo-4,6-dihydro-3H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3e)
To a solution of tert-butyl 2-methoxy-7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3d) (7.19 g, 25.31 mmol) in anhydrous dioxane (193 mL) was added drop by drop HCl 12 N (2.50 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h at 70Â°C then concentrated under vacuum. The residue was diluted with EtOAc and washed with water. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to provide tert-butyl 2,7-dioxo-4,6-dihydro-3H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3e) (3.43 g, 12.70 mmol, 50%) as an orange solid.
