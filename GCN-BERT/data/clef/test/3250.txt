Botanical designation: Mandevilla splendens. Cultivar denomination: ‘FGVP1’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Mandevilla plant, botanically known as Mandevilla splendens and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘FGVP1’. The new Mandevilla plant is a naturally-occurring branch mutation of Mandevilla splendens ‘DIP 79’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 19,698. The new Mandevilla plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor on a single plant within a population of plants of ‘DIP 79’ grown in a controlled greenhouse environment in Sebring, Fla. on Jul. 9, 2008. The new Mandevilla plant was selected on the basis of its vining plant habit and flower color. Asexual reproduction of the new Mandevilla plant by tip cuttings in a controlled greenhouse in Sebring, Fla. since Jul. 10, 2008 has shown that the unique features of this new Mandevilla plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of the new Mandevilla have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘FGVP1’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘FGVP1’ as a new and distinct Mandevilla plant: 1. Initially upright to somewhat outwardly spreading and strongly vining plant habit.2. Medium green-colored leaves.3. Pink-colored flowers.4. Good garden performance. Plants of the new Mandevilla differ primarily from plants of the parent, ‘DIP 79’, in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Mandevilla are more strongly vining than plants of ‘DIP 79’.2. Plants of the new Mandevilla and ‘DIP 79’ differ in flower color as plants of ‘DIP 79’ have red-colored flowers. Plants of the new Mandevilla can be compared to plants of the Mandevilla hybrida ‘Ginger’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 20,776. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Sebring, Fla., plants of the new Mandevilla differed from plants of ‘Ginger’ in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Mandevilla were more strongly vining than plants of ‘Ginger’.2. Plants of the new Mandevilla had shorter internodes than plants of ‘Ginger’.3. Plants of the new Mandevilla had smaller and lighter green-colored leaves than plants of ‘Ginger’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Mandevilla plant showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the actual colors of the new Mandevilla plant. The photograph on the first sheet comprises a side perspective view of a typical flowering plant of ‘FGVP1’ grown in a container. The photograph on the second sheet is a close-up view of a typical flowering plant of ‘FGVP1’. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION Plants used for the aforementioned photograph and following description were grown during the spring and summer in 1.5-gallon containers in an outdoor nursery in Fort Worth, Tex. and under cultural practices which closely approximate commercial production conditions. During the production of the plants, day temperatures ranged from 24° C. to 38° C. and night temperatures ranged from 21° C. to 24° C. Plants were six months old when the photographs and description were taken. In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 2007 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
