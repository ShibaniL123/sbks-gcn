(5) Preparation of tert-butyl 8-((2S,5R)-7-oxo-6-(sulfooxy)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]o ctane-3-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 8-((2S',5R)-6-hydroxyl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-formamido)-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1 ]octane-3-carboxylate (0.37 g, 0.94 mmol) was dissolved in isopropanol (3 mL) and water (3 mL), and then triethylamine (25 mg, 0.25 mmol) and sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex (0.15 g, 1.08 mmol) were added. The reaction system was stirred and reacted at 25 °C for 16 h. Ethyl acetate (10 mL) and water (10 mL) were added, after stirring, the phases were separated. To the aqueous phase was added Bu4NHSO4 (0.33 g, 0.97 mmol), and the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (10 mL×3). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtrated, and concentrated to obtain the title compound in colorless form (0.42 g, yield 95.4 %).
