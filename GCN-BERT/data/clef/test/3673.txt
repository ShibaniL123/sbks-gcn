(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetr ahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl3-(4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-3-acetyl-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7, 8, 9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 70k (5 mg, 0.01 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol, then 5mL of 0.2 M sodium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring for 2 hours, the reaction stopped. 10% citric acid was added until the pH of the reaction solution is acidic. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane three times. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by thin layer chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)a crylic acid 70 (3 mg, yield 68%) as a yellow solid.
