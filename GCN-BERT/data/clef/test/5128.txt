Description The Rain Seat has been designed to keep the person wearing the item dry when sitting down on a wet or damp surface. The Rain Seat consists of a thin, water-proof material which rolls up and is secured when not in use. The Rain Seat is fixed to the person using an adjustable belt (1), which has two pieces of material - Roll Up Fasteners [2], the same as used for the belt with popper type fasteners attached. Overall the Rain Seat is very light and will not obstruct or cause discomfort to the person wearing the product. When the user is walking around with the Rain Seat rolled up, the product will be un-noticeable as the persons t-shirt or jacket will probably cover the product. When the user wants to sit down on wet or damp grass, he/she can reach back and un-fasten the popper type fasteners (2 & 4]. The water-proof material can then be rolled down, covering the back of the users legs. When un-rolled the rain seat has a triangular appearance, as extra material is available to wrap around the users legs. A V shape has been cut in the centre of the bottom section, this is to allow the user to walk as normal when the Rain Seat is un-rolled. Two pieces of material - Leg Clip Fasteners (3], the same as used for the belt are fixed to each corner of the V shape at the bottom of the Rain Seat, where popper type fasteners are attached. On the bottom corners of the triangle there are pieces of material - Leg Clips (5), the same as used for the belt, which has three popper type clips. When the product is un-rolled, the user can wrap the extra material around their legs, where they can decide how loose or tight they want to fasten the clips (3 & 5) by selecting one of the three poppers. There are pockets (6] on each side for the user to keep belongings (Phone, Torch, Compass, Tickets etc] in easy reach. The user can continue to wear the Rain Seat in the un-rolled position, whilst walking around if required. When the user wants to roll up the Rain Seat the leg clips are un-fastened [3 & 5), the extra material used to cover the legs is folded back and then the water-proof material is rolled up. Three quarters up on the inside of the Rain Seat, are two pieces of material - Roll Up Clips (4), the same as used for the belt, where popper type fasteners are attached. As the user rolls up the water-proof material, these Roll Up Clips (4] can be found and used to secure to the Roll Up Fasteners (2) which are fixed just under the belt. The Rain Seat is now back to the rolled up position. Examples Of Use The Rain Seat could be used for all outdoor activities, such as walking/fishing and camping. The Rain Seat could also be used in festival situations where the ground is wet and damp 1) The triangular design of the material allows the waterproof fabric to wrap around the users legs. 2) The Leg Clip Fasteners (3) are used to secure the material around the legs.
