1.7: 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
143 mg (1 mmol) of potassium carbonate and 0.1 ml (1.3 mmol) of methyl iodide are added to a solution of 400 mg (0.9 mmol) of 5-bromo-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione in 12 ml of dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, then hydrolysed and diluted with ethyl acetate. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are washed once with water, then with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, eluted with a dichloromethane/methanol 90/10 mixture. 160 mg (39%) of 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a pale yellow solid.
