Step 2. Preparation of Ethyl 8-chloro-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-formate
Ethyl benzoylacetate (19.2g, 0.1mol) and 50ml of DMF were added to a 250ml three-necked flask and cooled to -20°C. Then 60% NaH (4.0g, 0.1mol) was added in portions and there were a lot of bubbles coming out. The temperature was kept not exceeding 0°C and the reaction was completed in about 30min. The solution was continued stirring for 15min and the temperature was warmed up to room temperature. The solution was stand-by with stirring. 3-Chloroisatoic anhydride (19.7g, 0.1mol) was dissolved in 100ml of DMF and added dropwise to the above reaction solution through a constant pressure dropping funnel. The reaction system was kept in a condition of anhydrous and oxygen free. After 30min, dropping was completed; the reaction solution was heated to 150°C and stirred. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The solvent was removed from the reaction solution under reduced pressure to give a black oil. Ice-water mixture was added and extraction was performed with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined and subjected to drying, removal of the solvent, made into a mixture for chromatography and separated by column chromatography to give 18.3g of a pale yellow solid with a yield of 55.9%.
