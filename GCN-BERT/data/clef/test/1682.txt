FIELD The present invention generally relates to medical systems and apparatus and uses thereof for treating obesity and/or obesity-related diseases. More specifically, the present invention relates to injection ports penetrable by a needle to add or remove saline and/or other appropriate fill materials to a gastric banding system. BACKGROUND Adjustable gastric banding apparatus have provided an effective and substantially less invasive alternative to gastric bypass surgery and other conventional surgical weight loss procedures. Despite the positive outcomes of invasive weight loss procedures, such as gastric bypass surgery, it has been recognized that sustained weight loss can be achieved through a laparoscopically-placed gastric band, for example, the LAP-BAND® (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, Calif.) gastric band or the LAP-BAND AP® (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, Calif.) gastric band. Generally, gastric bands are placed about the fundus, or cardia, or esophageal junction, of a patient's upper stomach forming a stoma that restricts food's passage into a lower portion of the stomach. When the stoma is of an appropriate size that is restricted by a gastric band, the food held in the upper portion of the stomach may provide a feeling of satiety or fullness that discourages overeating. Unlike gastric bypass procedures, gastric band apparatus are reversible and require no permanent modification to the gastrointestinal tract. An example of a gastric banding system is disclosed in Roslin, et al., U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2006/0235448, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this specific reference. Existing gastric bands periodically require adjustments to maintain an effective constriction about the stomach, to account for changes in the stomach tissue, reduction of fat or other factors causing movement and/or size change of the stomach. Some attempts have been made to allow for such adjustment of gastric bands. For example, hydraulic gastric bands utilize a fluid such as saline to fill an inflatable portion of the gastric band using a subcutaneous injection port. Adjustments to the amount of inflation may be made by injecting or extracting the fluid through the patient's skin into or out of the injection port, which then directs the fluid into or out of the inflatable portion of the gastric band. Current injection ports are typically designed to include complicated and/or intricate solid compressing geometries which may reduce functional performance and/or increase cost. For example, with reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, Redmond, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,781,680, discloses an injection port having a plurality of inter-related components including a filter element and a cup-shaped compression member, among other components. With reference to FIG. 2, Johnston, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,501 discloses a low-acute angle implantable device having a septum axially aligned with a connector. With reference to FIG. 3, Fogarty, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,039,712, discloses an implantable injection port having multiple elastomeric penetrable layers and mesh layers. The mesh layers are for creating fluid channels for the passage of fluids to the tubing port/connector. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, it may be desirable to develop an injection port being of a simpler assembly, improved reliability, cost savings, needle accessibility and/or sealing functionality of the device, among other benefits.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Apparatus, systems and/or methods that implement the embodiments of the various features of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. The drawings and the associated descriptions are provided to illustrate some embodiments of the present invention and not to limit the scope of the present invention. Throughout the drawings, reference numbers are re-used to indicate correspondence between referenced elements. The present invention generally provides injection port designs and improvements thereof which allow, for example, cheaper injection ports for gastric banding systems while still maintaining acceptable levels of reliability and functionality. These injection ports allow a physician to connect to the closed fluid system of the gastric banding system. In essence, the physician may locate the position of the injection port, puncture the patient's skin and the septum of the injection port with a needle, and make the necessary fluid adjustment to the gastric banding system by either adding or removing the fluid. Once completed, the needle is withdrawn from the septum and the patient's skin and the septum self-seals the puncture of the injection port. While discussed herein to be related to a gastric banding system, one skilled in the art will understand that the present invention is versatile and may be implemented with respect to any medical system, gastric-band related or not, which may be enhanced with an injection port. For example, cancer patients who require an injection port for frequent access to their veins may benefit from the implementation of an embodiment of an injection port described herein. Turning to FIG. 4, an implanted gastric banding system 400 is illustrated as implanted within a patient's body 430, and more specifically, forming a stoma around an upper portion of the stomach 425 of the patient's body 430. The implanted gastric banding system 400 may include a gastric band 405 having an inflatable portion 410. The gastric band 405 may be fluidly coupled with an injection port or an access port 415 via a tube or tubing 420. As used herein, the terms “injection port” and “access port” may be interchangeable. A syringe 440 having a needle 435 may penetrate the body 430 of the patient at a location proximal to the injection port 415 to add or remove fluid. The fluid added or removed may either inflate (if fluid is added) or deflate (if fluid is removed) the inflatable portion 410 of the gastric band 405, thereby increasing (if fluid is added) the degree of constriction that the gastric band 405 imparts on the upper portion of the stomach 425 or decreasing (if fluid is removed) the degree of constriction that the gastric band 405 imparts on the upper stomach 425. In this manner, adjustments to the gastric banding system 400 may be performed via the injection port 415. FIG. 5A illustrates a staked-septum injection port 500. For clarity, a stem or a tubing-insertion access is not shown. In one embodiment, the injection port 500 may be injection port 415 of FIG. 4. The injection port 500 may include a housing 505 and an inserted septum 510. FIG. 5B illustrates a cross-sectional view of the injection port 500 of FIG. 5A. In this view, a structure of a retaining lip 515 is visible and shown to overhang the outside or needle-injection surface of the injection port 500. The retaining lip 515 may serve to prevent the septum 510 from moving out of the housing 505. The geometry of the housing 505 further prevents the septum 510 from moving deeper into the housing 505, when the septum 510 is pressed into position. For example, a diameter 511 of the bottom surface of the septum 510 may be greater than a diameter 506 of the bottom cavity 530 of the housing 505. In other words, since the diameter 511 of the septum 510 is greater than a diameter of the bottom cavity 530, the septum 510 is prevented from further movement into the bottom cavity 530. In this manner, the septum 510 may be securely held in place or position after being pressed into the housing 505. In one embodiment, when the septum 510 is held in position within the housing 505, the retaining lip 515 and/or the tight fit of the septum 510 within the housing 505 may cause axial and/or radial compression, thereby enhancing a self-sealing feature of the septum 510 in addition to holding the septum 510 in place. FIG. 5C illustrates the housing 505 without the septum 510 for further clarity of the structural components of the housing 505. As shown, the housing 505 may include a cavity 520, which may be divided into two portions, a top cavity 525 and a bottom cavity 530. The top cavity 525 may be defined by a side inner wall 535 spanning circumferentially about an interior portion of the housing 505. The side inner wall 535 may also taper inwards moving away from an opening of the cavity 520. The top cavity 525 may be configured to have a similar shape and/or dimensions as the septum 510 in order to house the septum 510. The bottom cavity 530 may be defined by a second inner side wall 540 and a bottom surface 545 of the housing 505. The bottom cavity 530 may be intended to act as a fluid reservoir for carrying fluid injected by a needle to the inflatable portion of a gastric band and/or for carrying fluid from the inflatable portion of the gastric band to the needle. FIG. 5D and FIG. 5E illustrate a perspective, cross-sectional view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of a septum insertion and sealing process of the injection port 500. As shown, a horn 550, which acts as an insertion and sealing tool, may be initially positioned above the septum 510. The horn 550 may include a lip mold 555 located on a surface of the horn 550 adjacent to the portion of the horn 550 attached to the septum 510. The lip mold 555 may surround an outer circumference of the septum 510. As shown, the horn 550 may direct and position the septum 510 to be pressed into the top cavity 525. FIG. 5F and FIG. 5G further illustrate a perspective, cross-sectional view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of a pressing step of the septum insertion and sealing process of the injection port 500. Here, the horn 550 is being pressed downward to move the septum 510 into the top cavity 525 of the housing 505. In this position, the first inner side wall 535 may be in contact with the septum 510 and may exert radial compression on the septum 510. As the septum 510 moves lower into the housing 510, radial forces may be increased due to the tapering of the inner side wall 535, thereby increasing compression on the septum 510. FIGS. 5H and 5I illustrate a perspective, cross-sectional view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of the septum 510 being pressed further into the housing 505. As shown, a retaining edge 570, located at the top of the housing 505, may protrude into the lip mold 555. In its current state (as shown in FIG. 5I), the retaining edge 570 cannot effectively prevent the septum 510 from exiting the top of the cavity 520. However, the retaining edge 570 does allow the septum 510 to enter (or be pressed) into the cavity 520. Once the septum 510 is pressed into the cavity 520, the retaining edge 570 of the housing 505 may be melted as the horn 550 may supply heat, or heat may be introduced to the retaining edge 570. To facilitate the melting of the retaining edge 570, a plastic, polymer, or other material having a melting point below the melting points of the material of the septum 510 and the material of the horn 550 may be used. In this manner, the retaining edge 570 may be melted and molded into the lip mold 555 while retaining the integrity of the lip mold 555 and the septum 510. As a result, the retaining edge 570 is transformed into a different physical shape, thereby holding the septum 510 in place inside the cavity 520. FIG. 5J and FIG. 5K illustrate a perspective, cross-sectional view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of the retaining edge 570 having been transformed into the retaining lip 515 having an overhang portion which extends to contact and hold the septum 510 in place, thereby preventing the septum 510 from exiting the cavity 530 of the housing 505. The retaining lip 515 may also function to provide an axial load on the septum 510, which may cause an increase in radial compression exerted by the inner side wall 535. FIG. 5L and FIG. 5M illustrate a perspective, cross-sectional view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of the manufactured injection port 500 with the horn 550 removed after the retaining lip 515 has cooled and hardened. In this manner, the injection port 500 may provide certain advantages over the prior art, such as reduced parts (the resulting injection port 500 has two distinct parts), simple molding of parts, and/or a simplified process for manufacturing a port/septum assembly. FIG. 6 is a flow chart 600 of the manufacturing process for the injection port 500 of FIG. 5A. At step 605, the housing 505 for the injection port 500 may be molded. At step 610, the septum 510 may be molded. At step 615, the septum 510 may be pressed into the housing 505 by using the horn 550, and the retaining edge 570 of the housing 505 may be melted and molded into the lip mold 550 of the horn 550 resulting in the retaining lip 515. At step 620, after the retaining lip 515 hardens, the horn 550 may be removed, leaving the injection port 500. The assembly portion (e.g., step 615) comprises only one step, and accordingly, this approach may be considered a “one step process”. Advantageously, by simplifying the process to manufacture an injection port, cost-savings and increased uniformity may be achieved. FIG. 7A illustrates a septum-pressed injection port 700. Shown assembled, the injection port 700 may comprise two components: a housing 705 having septum-mating features and a septum 710 having conical retention features. The housing 705 may be plastic-molded and/or utilize any other moldable materials suitable for implantation into the human body. The septum 710 may be silicone-molded and/or may utilize any other moldable materials penetrable by a needle. The housing 705 and the septum 710 may be of geometric and appropriate tolerance design such that the septum 710 may be manually loaded into the housing 705 while simultaneously maintaining effective radial and axial compression. Also shown is a stem or a tubing-insertion access 755. In one embodiment, the injection port 700 may be the injection port 415 of FIG. 4. FIG. 7B illustrates the septum 710 removed from the housing 705 to more clearly illustrate the geometry of the septum 710. As shown here, the septum 710 may have conical features including a retention ring 715 designed to hold the septum 710 within the housing 705, a needle-injection surface 720 designed to be penetrable by a needle, and a sealing surface 725 positioned between the needle-injection surface 720 and the retention ring 715 designed to further seal in fluid held within the housing 705 by the septum 710. FIG. 7C is a cross-sectional view of the housing 705 without the septum 710 (the septum 710 being omitted in this FIG. for clarity of the features of the housing 705). The housing 705 may include a large cavity 730, being further divided into a top cavity 733 for holding the septum 710 and a bottom cavity 745 for carrying fluid (as the fluid reservoir). The top cavity 733 may be defined by a tapered side wall 750 positioned between a retention lip 735 and a retention protrusion 740. The retention lip 735 may be designed to overhang the retention ring 715 of the septum 710 when the septum 710 is correctly positioned within the top cavity 733. The retention protrusion 740 may be designed to protrude from the tapered side wall 750 defining a bottom retaining surface for contacting a bottom surface of the septum 710 and preventing the contacted portions of the bottom surface of the septum from extending beyond the retention protrusion when the retention lip 735 is overhanging and contacting the retention ring 715 of the septum 710, thereby preventing the septum 710 from moving into the bottom cavity 745. The bottom cavity 745 may be defined by a bottom side wall 760 which may have a channel or fluid conduit leading to the tubing-insertion access 755. As the housing 705 may be constructed out of a mold, one or more of the structural features of the housing 705 may be integrated into the physical structure of the housing 705. FIG. 7D is a cross-sectional view of the septum 710 within the housing 705 and further clarifies how the features of the septum 710 mate with the features of the housing 705 to secure the septum 710 within the housing 705. As shown, the retention lip 735 overhangs and contacts a portion of the retention ring 715 of the septum 710 to prevent the septum 710 from exiting the cavity 733 of the housing 705 when the septum 710 is positioned within the cavity 733. The retention protrusion 740 may contact a bottom surface 726 of the septum 710 to prevent the septum 710 from moving into the bottom cavity 745, leaving the bottom cavity 745 free to carry fluid to and from the inflatable portion of the gastric band through the tubing-insertion access 755. In addition, when the septum 710 is held between the retention lip 735 and the retention protrusion 740, the septum 710 is radially compressed (by the tapered walls) and axially compressed (by the retention lip 735 and the retention protrusion 740), thereby enhancing the self-sealing features of the septum 710. FIG. 8 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the pressed-septum injection port 700. In essence, the tubing-insertion access 755 is replaced by a tubing connector 855 molded and/or integrated into a housing 805 of the injection port 800. All other components of the injection port 800 including a septum 800 correspond with features discussed above in conjunction with the injection port 700. The embodiments of FIGS. 7A-7D and FIG. 8 provide reduced cost by eliminating all but two components needed for an injection port, namely the housing and the septum while further reducing assembly costs during production by making it a one step process. Furthermore, assembly may be performed with manual operation or with a simple tool, thereby further reducing the need to design or utilize expensive machinery for assembly. FIG. 9 is a flow chart 900 of the manufacturing process for the injection port 700 of FIG. 7A and/or the injection port 800 of FIG. 8A. As shown, the manufacturing process 900 begins at step 905 with the molding of the septum into the shape illustrated in FIG. 7B. Next, at step 910, the housing is molded into the shape as shown in FIG. 7C. At step 915, once the septum and the housing are molded, the septum is pressed into the housing until the retention ring is engaged by the retention lip and the septum is held in place as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7D. FIG. 10A illustrates another embodiment of an injection port, and more particularly, showing a drum-shaped injection port 1000. The drum-shaped injection port 1000 may, in one embodiment, be shaped substantially similar to a hemisphere where the septum is located on the flat side, and not on the curved side. The drum-shaped injection port 1000 may provide the benefits of reduced production costs and improved reliability while maintaining the efficacy level common to current injection ports. The drum-shaped injection port 1000 may be assembled manually or with only a simple tool (e.g., to apply heat). As further illustrated in the exploded view of the drum-shaped injection port 1000 of FIG. 10B and the cross-sectional view of FIG. 10C, the drum-shaped injection port 1000 may include a housing 1005 having a retaining ring 1020 (e.g., shaped as a circle or oval) defining an opening at the top of the housing 1005. The retaining ring 1020 may be integrated with a dome-shaped base which is configured to define a cavity or reservoir 1030 that holds the fluid. The drum-shaped injection port 1000 may also include a septum 1010 shaped to fit the opening of the retaining ring 1020 such that a top surface 1035 of the septum 1010 is flush with a top edge 1040 of the retaining ring 1020. The septum 1010 may be a biocompatible rubber or other biocompatible materials having self-sealing capabilities or properties having a diameter between about 1 centimeters (cm) and 8 centimeters (cm), but preferably between about 1 cm-about 5 cm. The retaining ring 1020 may define a first portion of a cavity having a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of the septum 1010. The first portion of the cavity may lead into a second portion of the cavity having an incrementally decreasing diameter moving away from the retaining ring 1020 in order to produce the drum or hemispherical shape of the injection port 1000 and span the top surface 1035 of the septum 1010. In addition, the injection port 1000 may include a covering seal 1015 configured to fit the exterior of the retaining ring 1020. The covering seal 1015 may have a mesh or some other type of needle penetrable material to cover the septum 1010 and to assist the holding of the septum 1010 in place, and to help maintain septum integrity during internalized increased port pressure. While not shown, a tubing connector could be molded into the drum-shaped injection port 1000 via side access or integrated into a reservoir defining wall 1025 of the housing 1005. By integrating the tubing connector into the mold, this concept has the flexibility of incorporating the tubing connection anywhere along the housing 1005. FIG. 11 is a flow chart 1100 detailing one embodiment of to the manufacturing process of the drum-shaped injection port 1000 of FIGS. 10A-10C. At step 1105, the housing 1005 is molded out of biocompatible material such as a plastic or metal into the cup or drum shape with a low profile. Next, at step 1100, the septum 1010 may be molded out of a rubber to be in the shape of a disc and having a diameter to fit tightly into the retaining ring 1020 of the housing 1005. At step 1115, the covering seal 1015 may be molded out of a biocompatible plastic (e.g., a plastic with a lowering melting point than that of both the housing 1005 and the rubber septum 1010, and configured to fit about the exterior of the retaining ring 1020. Alternatively, the covering seal 1015 may be stamped, extruded, cut, woven, or braided, among other techniques. Once the parts are constructed, then at step 1120, the septum 1010 may be inserted into the housing 1005 undergoing radial compression caused by interference with the retaining ring 1020. The septum 1010 should fit within the retaining ring 1020 in a flush manner and may be prevented from protruding into the cavity 1030 by the shape of the reservoir-defining wall 1025. In other words, because the reservoir-defining wall 1025 is shaped as a dome and gradually decreases in diameter as it moves away from the retaining ring 1020, the diameter of the septum 1010 causes it to be held in place. At step 1125, the covering seal 1015 may be pulled over the septum 1010 thereby forming a seal. The covering seal 1015 may be form fit over the exterior of the retaining ring 1020 as well, and in this manner, capping the drum-shaped injection port 1000. At step 1130, the covering seal 1015 may be thermally sealed circumferentially about the exterior of the retaining ring 1020 by utilizing a heating device to prevent leaks and to hold the septum 1010 in place. Alternatively, the covering seal 1015 may be crimpled, bonded or mechanically fixed to the housing 1005. In one embodiment, the septum 1010 and the covering seal 1015 may be orientation-independent thereby further simplifying the manufacturing process. Furthermore, the resulting drum-shaped injection port 1000 has a low-profile which may be aesthetically acceptable to the patient while still providing a large surface area for needle penetration. In one embodiment, the covering seal 1015 may be mesh-patterned to increase longevity and maintain integrity even after multiple needle injections. FIG. 12A illustrates a mold-in septum port 1200. Here, in this embodiment, a septum 1255 having self-sealing characteristics and properties may be molded into an already existing housing 1205, resulting in the mold-in septum port 1200. Structurally, the housing 1205 may include a large cavity 1215, being further divided into a top cavity 1220 for holding the septum 1255 (shown in FIG. 12D) and a bottom cavity 1225 for carrying fluid (as the fluid reservoir). The top cavity 1220 may be defined by a top side wall 1230 positioned between a retention lip 1235 and a retention protrusion 1240. The retention lip 1235 may be designed to extend over the surface of the septum 1255 to prevent the septum 1255 from exiting out of the top of the mold-in septum port 1200 when the septum 1255 is correction positioned within the top cavity 1220. The retention protrusion 1240 may be designed to protrude from the top side wall 1230 and contact a bottom surface of the septum 1255, thereby preventing the septum from moving into the bottom cavity 1225. The bottom cavity 1225 may be defined by a bottom side wall 1245 which may have a channel or fluid conduit leading to a tubing-insertion access 1210. As the housing 1205 may be constructed out of a mold, all of the structural features of the housing 1205 may be integrated into the physical structure of the housing 1205. The physical structure of the housing 1205 of the mold-in septum port 1200 having been described, attention will now be turned to the manufacturing of the mold-in septum port 1200 with respect to FIGS. 12B-D and FIG. 13. As depicted in the flowchart of FIG. 13, at step 1305, the housing 1205 is molded, resulting in the “blank” housing 1205 of FIG. 12B. Once the housing 1205 is formed, the rest of the mold-in septum port 1200 may be assembled. At step 1310, and as shown in FIG. 12C, a temporary support filling 1270 such as an incompressible fluid, inflatable bladder and the like may be placed in the bottom cavity 1225 to prevent the later added silicone septum 1255 from sinking into the bottom cavity 1225. If desired, at step 1315, an interface layer 1275 designed to be needle-penetrable may be inserted on top of the temporary support material. After the temporary support filling 1270 is inserted to fill the bottom cavity 1225 of the housing 1205, the septum 1255 may now be inserted. At step 1320, the housing 1205 with the temporary support filling 1270 is placed in a molding machine and heated and/or stretched out to increase the inner diameters of the housing 1205. Next, at step 1325, the septum 1255 is inserted via the diameter-expanded opening of the housing 1205 and molded under compression. Then at step 1330, the heating or stretching of the housing 1205 is removed, thereby returning the housing to its original shape (with a smaller diameter of the openings, etc.) to fix the septum 1255 in place and further, to provide the septum 1255 with radial and axial compression to enhance the self-sealing capabilities of the septum 1255. The result of step 1330 is illustrated by FIG. 12D. At step 1335, the temporary support filling 1270 may be removed (e.g., through the tubing connector 1210) to result in the assembled mold-in septum port 1200 as depicted in FIG. 12A. As an alternative, an over-molded port 1400 as depicted in FIGS. 14A and 14B may provide for a completely sealed port encapsulated in solid material. Generally, a septum 1405, a compression ring 1410 defining a reservoir 1415 and a stem insert or tube connector 1420, as shown in FIG. 14C may be assembled in a top mold 1425 and the bottom mold 1426 of FIG. 14D to result in the assembly 1450 of FIG. 14E. The septum 1405 may include a top surface, a bottom surface and a side wall for joining the top surface and the bottom surface. The compression ring 1410 may receive the septum 1405 and further define a reservoir 1415 and may include a ring portion 1416 for holding the septum 1405 in place, and a reservoir defining portion 1417 integrated with the ring portion 1416, the reservoir defining portion 1417 having a stem insert or connector interface 1418 (e.g., a hole or a port). Referring back to FIG. 14D, the mold 1450 may allow for the injection of the biocompatible material (e.g., titanium) to form the housing and encapsulate a portion of the septum 1405, the compression ring 1410 and the stem insert 1420. The top mold 1425 may include a void or spacing designed to be filled by an injected biocompatible material such as titanium to form the housing of the over-molded port 1400. The bottom mold 1426 may include a stem holder 1435 designed to hold the stem insert or tube connector 1420. In one embodiment, the spacing in the top mold 1425 and the bottom mold 1426 to formulate the housing may provide radial compression to the septum 1405 once the biocompatible material to be used as the housing is injected into and/or molded over the septum 1405, the compression ring 1410 and the stem insert or tube connector 1420. Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, intentional voids can be left in the over-molded plastic to reduce the use of implantable materials to save on costs. These voids could be filled, left open or designed with features to promote tissue in-growth at the base of the over-molded port 1400. Referring back to the compression ring 1410, in one embodiment, a high durometer (shore A durometer of 70 or greater) material may be used to construct the compression ring 1410. FIG. 15 illustrates one example of a cross-sectional view of a stretched-on compression assembly 1500, which in one embodiment, may be utilized as the compression ring 1410 of the over-molded port 1400 of FIG. 14A. Here, the compression ring 1505 may surround a previously-cured septum 1510 by being stretched around or compression-molded onto the outside of the septum 1510 to create the stand-alone radially compressed septum. FIG. 16 illustrates an alternative compression ring assembly 1600 which may be incorporated as the compression ring 1410 of the over-molded port 1400 of FIG. 14A. More particularly, as shown in FIG. 16, a ring structure 1605 constructed out of a memory material (e.g., a nitinol compression coil) may be utilized as the compression ring and molded into the silicone rubber septum 1610. Compression may be effected by heating the memory material to return the memory material to its memory state thereby radially compressing the silicone rubber septum 1610. A variation of the over-molded port 1400 of FIG. 14A which does not require a compression ring is illustrated in FIG. 17. While the resulting over-molded port 1700 may appear similar to the over-molded port 1400 of FIG. 14A, the top and bottom molds 1725, 1726 and certain component parts (the reservoir 1710) are modified. For example, the compression ring portion of the analogous component (compression ring and reservoir 1410) has been removed, resulting in only the “reservoir 1710”. The reservoir 1710 may include septum supporting structures 1730 to suspend a septum 1705 in place above the reservoir 1710. In this embodiment, the pressure of the injected material to form the housing may provide radial compression on the septum 1705. The concept of using the injection process to provide compression may be modified and applied to other injection ports. For example, FIG. 18A illustrates an injection port 1800 having a septum 1805 inserted into a housing 1810. Compression on the septum 1805 may be provided by injecting a compression providing substance, for example, liquid silicone injections 1815 under pressure after the septum 1805 is already inserted into the housing 1810 without the desired amount of compression. In this particular embodiment, vents 1820 may be left to seal the injection port 1800. This type of construction of the injection port 1800 may be considered a post-injected silicone compressed septum assembly. FIG. 18B illustrates injection nozzles 1825 which may be used to provide the liquid silicone injections into a gap 1816. In this manner, the septum 1805 may be radially compressed. The compression of the septum 1805 improves the sealing of the injection port 1800 and also provides the benefit of improving the self-sealing characteristics of the septum 1805 after the septum 1805 is punctured with a needle. In one embodiment, manufacturing the injection port 1800 may comprise molding a housing 1810 to include an opening at a top of the housing 1810 leading into a cavity defined by an inner side wall 1817 of the housing 1810 and an inner bottom wall of the housing 1810, the cavity having a first portion and a second portion, the first portion of the cavity being positioned between the opening and the second portion of the cavity. Next, a septum 1805 may be inserted into the first portion of the cavity leaving a gap 1815 between an exterior of the septum 1805 and the inner side wall. Then, radial compression exerted on the septum 1805 may be increased by adding liquid silicone or other appropriate substances to fill the gap 1815 between the exterior of the septum 1805 and the inner side wall of the housing 1810 via injection. That is, liquid silicone may be injected into the gap 1815 using injection nozzles inserted into openings that extends from the side of the housing 1810 into the gap 1815. FIG. 19A illustrates a dome-shaped port 1900 which may be, in one embodiment, include a compressed septum (e.g., formed from a silicone from a membrane) located in a housing to form a hemispherically-shaped object. The dome-shaped port 1900 may advantageously incorporate the compressive effect that bending has on materials to create a compressed silicone septum 1905 located in a housing 1910. To construct the dome-shaped port 1900, a flat piece of silicone-sheeting 1901 (as shown in FIG. 19B) with woven mesh adhered to one side may be used. The silicone-sheeting 1901 may originally be a disc, and may be integrated with a mesh 1902. As the silicone-sheeting 1901 is forced into a dome shape, the silicone-sheeting 1901 may be structurally held in the dome shape with the mesh 1902 on the outside to maintain the compression to seal against needle punctures as shown in FIG. 19C. Structurally, the housing 1910 may include a substantially circular cut-out portion defined by a circumferential edge 1906 (for exposing the septum to a needle), a bottom surface having 1908 a diameter larger than the circumferential edge 1906, and a curved side wall 1907 extending from the circumferential edge 1907 to the bottom surface 1908. In one embodiment, barbs (not shown) may be designed in the mesh 1902 to hold it in place when the injection port 1900 is under pressure. As an alternative, the silicone-sheeting 1901 may be molded into an inverted dome. When the inverted dome is flipped and assembled into the housing 1910, the compression may be doubled to that of the flat-disc formed into the dome shape. Various port assemblies now having been described, attention will be turned to certain features which may be added to any port assembly, whether described herein or not, to further improve the performance of the port assembly. In one embodiment, a lip seal may be incorporated into a septum to improve reservoir sealing under pressure. The lip seal may still allow for improved needle puncture sealing. For example, FIG. 20 illustrates an injection port 2000 having a lip seal 2005 integrated into the septum 2010. When the lip seal 2005 is pressed against a reservoir wall 2015 as the fluid increases in a cavity 2020 (e.g., in response to pressure increase caused by the added fluid), the sealing capacity or ability of the lip seal 2005 also increases, thereby preventing leaks around the septum 2010. In addition to lip seals, a softer tubing connection may be incorporated to prevent premature wearing of the connected tubing to an injection port and reduce or eliminate the need for titanium stems or bulky strain reliefs to protect the tubing. Softer tubing connections may avoid the use of harder materials and protruding stems (although the user of harder materials is still possible if needed). Typically, a stem may be load-concentrated at an unprotected and minimally supported portion. For example, FIG. 21 illustrates a tubing connector 2100 load concentrated at arrow 2105. By having the load concentrated as such a point, the connector failure rate is adversely increased. Indeed, this is the source of most connector failures. By sinking the tubing connector as shown in FIGS. 22 and 23, the load may be diverted from the tip of the connector. FIG. 22 illustrates a sunken connector 2200 having an exit that is radiused at location 2210 to further prevent a concentrated load on the sunken connector 2200. The connector 2200 is “sunken” into or partially inserted into the access port housing itself. In other words, a first portion of the sunken connector 2200 is located inside the access port housing while a second portion of the sunken connector 2200 is located outside of the access port housing and leading to the tubing. By configuring the connector 2200 to be insertable into the housing, the load is diverted away from the tip of the connector 2200 and supported by not only the tip of the connector 2200 but also by the portion of the access port housing surrounding the top of the connector 2200. Alternatively, and/or in addition, a sunken connector 2300 may be utilized with a strain relief mechanism 2305. Similar to connector 2200, connector 2300 is insertable into the access port housing itself. Here, the strain relief mechanism 2305 may appear as wings or protrusions that partially or fully fill the opening of the access port to provide strain relief. The port connector may further be enhanced to provide additional benefits to the patient. For example, a tubing connector 2400 of FIG. 24 may include in-growth features 2405 to create proper fixation of an injection port to a patient's tissues. Such in-growth features 2405 may be added to the tubing connector 2400 or tubing as a means of attachment rather than sutures, anchors or mesh. These in-growth features 2405 may come in many forms such as pores, hole-filled, or other configurations to encourage integration into the patient's bodily tissues. In this particular embodiment, the in-growth features 2405 may be two sets of four integrated holes on either side of the tubing connector 2400. However, the actual number and/or configuration of the holes may be altered as desired.
