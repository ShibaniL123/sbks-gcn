A single boom arm 218 on each side of the hopper may have a first or upper end pivotably mounted to a bracket 216 near the top of a mast. Each boom arm may be generally L-shaped with a downward bend angle, between about 90 degrees and about 135 degrees, where the boom arm extends rearwardly along the hopper side wall and supports the hopper. In the stowed position, the second or lower end of each boom arm may have a generally vertical or near vertical orientation adjacent the hopper sidewall near the underside of the hopper. In a second embodiment, a first end of each lift cylinder 220 may be pivotably mounted to bracket 216 on mast 214 below boom arm 218, and a second end of the lift cylinder may be pivotably mounted to bracket 222 on an intermediate portion of the boom arm. The lift cylinders are attached to hydraulic hoses 224 and may be actuated by operator controls to extend the lift cylinders and raise the boom arms and hopper for dumping, or to retract the lift cylinders and lower the boom arms and hopper into the stowed position for grass collection. During grass collection, the masts 214 and L-shaped boom arms 218 are below the top of operator seat 205, providing unobstructed sight lines and good rear visibility for the operator. In a second embodiment, material collection parking system 200 may include left and right lower pins or transverse rods 236 at a lower front portion of the hopper near the lower ends of masts 214. The rods may be captured in left and right J-shaped slots 226 on a lower portion of rear bracket 213 on the frame of the lawn tractor. Each J-shaped slot may have a rear facing portion 228 and a vertical portion 230. To secure the hopper to the lawn tractor in the stowed position, the lawn tractor may back up until the rods are in the rear facing portion of J-shaped slots 226, and then the hopper may be lowered until the rods are at the bottom of the vertical portion of the J-shaped slots. Additionally, the hopper may be secured to the lawn tractor in the stowed position by left and right upper pins 240 inserted through left and right holes 241 through an upper part of rear bracket 213, and left and right holes 232 provided in the hopper frame. As shown in FIGS. 9-10, a second embodiment of material collection parking system 200 may include left and right front parking support legs 242 and left and right rear parking support legs 244 attached to the hopper. The rear parking support legs may slide up and down between a stowed position adjacent the hopper left and right side walls, and a deployed position extending down from the hopper side walls to the ground surface. The front parking support legs may be pivoted 90 degrees between a stowed position under the hopper floor, and a deployed position extending down from the hopper floor to the ground surface. In a second embodiment, the left and right front parking support legs 242 may be mounted under the hopper floor with brackets 246 and front leg supports 250 hinged to the front parking support legs. Each front leg 242 may be held in the stowed position by inserting a pin in a first set of corresponding holes through front leg 242, support 250, and bracket 246. Each front leg 242 may be pivoted 90 degrees and may be held in the deployed position by inserting the pin in a second set of corresponding holes through front leg 242, support 250 and bracket 246. Alternatively, the front parking support legs may be mounted to the hopper side walls. In a second embodiment, each rear leg 244 may be mounted to the hopper side wall with bracket 248. Each rear leg may be held in the stowed position by inserting pin 260 in hole 262 through rear leg 244 and a corresponding hole in the bracket. Each rear leg 244 may slide downwardly and may be held in the deployed position by inserting pin 260 in hole 263 through rear leg 244 and a corresponding hole in the bracket. In a second embodiment, material collection parking system 200 may be moved between the stowed position on the rear of the lawn tractor for use during mowing, and the deployed position off the lawn tractor. In the stowed position, the top ends of the masts and boom arms are lower than the top of the operator seat to provide unobstructed rear sight lines for the operator. The left and right lift cylinders 220 may be extended to raise hopper 202. With the hopper raised, pins 252, 260 may be removed from the front and rear parking support legs. The operator may slide the rear parking support legs down to the deployed position, and may pivot the front parking support legs to the deployed position. The pins then may be reinserted. Optionally, hydraulic controls may be used to extend dump cylinder 265 to tip the hopper back slightly (preferably about 10 degrees) before lowering the hopper. The lift cylinder then may be retracted to lower the hopper until front parking support legs 242 and rear parking support legs 244 contact the ground surface. When the hopper is supported by the support legs, upper pins 240 then may be removed from holes 241 in the upper part of the rear bracket and holes 232 in the upper part of the hopper frame. Dump cylinder 265 than may be extended to raise the front of the hopper slightly, moving rods 236 upwardly in the vertical portion 230 of the J-shaped slots. The operator then may drive the lawn tractor forward far enough until rods 236 are out of the rear facing portion 228 of the J-shaped slots. The hydraulic controls then may be used to retract the lift cylinders 220 to lower masts 214 onto the ground surface, before the hydraulic hoses are disconnected.
