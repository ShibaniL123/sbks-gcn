Step 5: Preparation of tert-butyl 3-(cyanomethyl)-3-[4-[2-(cyclopropylcarbonylamino) -[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-5-yl]pyrazole-1-yl]azetidine-1-carboxylate (Intermediate 7)
To N-[5-(1H-pyrazole-4-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl] cyclopropane carboxamide(200 mg, 745.5 umol), tert-butyl 3-(cyanomethylene)azetidine-1-carboxylate(144.8 mg, 745.5 umol), dissolved in acetonitrile(5 mL), was added DBU(340.49 mg, 2.3mmol) and reacted at room temperature for 16 hours. After LCMS showed that raw material was completely reacted, the reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in mixed solution of water(20 mL) and ethyl acetate(20 mL), and the layers were separated and extracted. The combined organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate was distilled under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified through preparative TLC(pure ethyl acetate) to give tert-butyl 3-(cyanomethyl)-3-[4-[2-(cyclopropylcarbonylamino)-[1,2,4]triazolo[[1,5-a]pyridin-5-yl]p yrazole-1-yl]azetidine-1-carboxylate(170 mg, 44.4% yield) as a pale yellow solid.
