TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to spiro compounds having GPR40 agonist activity, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof, a pharmaceutical composition containing the same and a pharmaceutical use thereof. BACKGROUND ART Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease characterized by sugar and lipid metabolic disorder, and there is a risk that it may lead to various pathognomonic complexities resulting from an abnormally high blood sugar level (blood glucose level). The number of patients with diabetes mellitus in the world is estimated to exceed 180 million as of 2006. The onset of diabetes mellitus has been reported to relate to environmental factors such as overeating, obesity, lack of exercise in addition to genetic factors. Diabetes mellitus is mainly classified into type 1 diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)). Most of the patients (about 90%) suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss of insulin-secreting β cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas and type 2 diabetes mellitus is caused by two factors which are deficient insulin secretion due to reduced glucose sensitivity of pancreatic β cells and reduced insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues such as muscle, adipose and liver. Currently, exercise therapy and diet therapy are used in the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus, and medication therapy is used as well. A typical medication therapy in current use includes insulin therapy and oral hypoglycemic agents. The oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) include sulfonylureas (SUs), biguanides, α-glucosidase inhibitors (α GIs) and thiazolidine derivatives (TZDs). However, these medicines have side effects such as hypoglycemia, liver damage and gastrointestinal disease, and therefore an effective method for using these medicines has been studied and developed. In addition, the research on a novel mechanism-based treatment and prevention method has been underway actively. Recent studies of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have led to the discovery of GPR40 (G protein-coupled receptor 40), also known as free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFR1), which is a protein having seven transmembrane domains and whose ligand is a free fatty acid, in particular a mid- and long-chain fatty acid. GPR40 is known to highly express in the pancreas of rodents, in particular in pancreatic β cells. Meanwhile, GPR40 is shown to express in the brain as well as pancreatic β cells of human. With regard to the function of GPR40, it is known that a free fatty acid, a ligand for GPR40, acts on GPR40 in pancreatic β cells, and thereby β cells secrete insulin depending on glucose level. In addition, analysis of GPR40 knockout mice reveals that GPR40 may be involved in pathology of obesity and diabetes mellitus. As a GPR40-related disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, ketoacidosis, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipemia, hyperlipoproteinemia, metabolic syndrome, obesity, atherosclerosis, etc. are known. For these reasons, attention has been drawn to GPR40 as a novel target of diabetes mellitus.

For example, the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus recommended in Japan, United States and World Health Organization (WHO) are as follows. According to the diagnostic criterion for diabetes mellitus issued by Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) in 1999, diabetes mellitus refers to any of the following conditions: fasting plasma glucose level (FPG) of 126 mg/dl or higher, 2-hour post-load plasma glucose level (2 hPG) in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 200 mg/dl or higher and basal plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher. Also, the case which belongs neither to the above diabetes mellitus and nor to the normal type having a condition of fasting plasma glucose level of lower than 110 mg/dl or 2-hour post-load plasma glucose level in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of lower than 140 mg/dl is defined as the borderline type (impaired glucose regulation: IGR). According to the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus issued by WHO in 1998 and by American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 1997, diabetes mellitus refers to a condition of fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher and 2-hour post-load plasma glucose level in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test of 200 mg/dl or higher. These criteria also heavily focus on detecting a high-risk diabetic population (prediabetes). The symptoms during transition from prediabetes to diabetes mellitus include impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and a combination thereof. Impaired glucose tolerance refers to a condition which meets fasting plasma glucose level <126 mg/dl and 2-hour post-load plasma glucose level in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test ≧140 mg/dl but <200 mg/dl. Impaired fasting glucose refers to a condition which meets fasting plasma glucose level ≧110 mg/dl but <126 mg/dl and 2-hour post-load plasma glucose level in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test <140 mg/dl (ADA defines impaired fasting glucose as a condition which meets fasting plasma glucose level ≧100 mg/dl but <126 mg/dl).

The compound of the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof is useful as a medicament for treating diabetes mellitus with secondary failure of sulfonylurea therapy. In the treatment of diabetes mellitus with secondary failure of sulfonylurea therapy, a sulfonylurea compound or a fast-acting insulin secretion-promoting agent cannot exert insulin secretion-promoting effect, and therefore its hypoglycemic effect is unsatisfactory. Even for the patients with such diabetes mellitus, the compound of the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof can be used.

Test Example 1 Evaluation of Effect of Test Compounds on Ca2+ Mobilization by Using a Stable GPR40-Expressing Cell Test Method (1) Cell A stable human GPR40-expressing HEK293 cell was used. (2) Cell Medium Preparation and Cell Culture A cell suspension was prepared such that the above-mentioned cells were present at 6×105 cells/mL in a cell culture medium (D-MEM (Nikken Bio Medical Laboratory) supplemented with 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biowest) and 1%(v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution (Invitrogen)). The cell suspension was plated in a 384-well plate (poly-D-lysine coated plate; Falcon) in a volume of 25 μl/well, and the plate was incubated at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 overnight. Each test compound was added to the cell at each concentration as below, and then the change in intracellular calcium level was measured by FLIPRTETRA (Molecular Devices). Before the FLIPR assay, the following preparative solutions were prepared. (3) Preparation of Preparative Solutions for FLIPR Assay First, an assay buffer was prepared for use in the preparation of a fluorescent dye solution and a diluent buffer solution. The assay buffer was prepared by adding 1M HEPES solution (Invitrogen) to Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen), followed by adjusting the pH to 7.4 with 1M NaOH (Nacalai Tesque). Next, the fluorescent dye solution and the diluent buffer solution were prepared. The fluorescent dye solution was prepared in accordance with the instruction manual attached to Fluo-4NW calcium assay kit (Invitrogen), followed by addition of bovine serum albumin (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.1%(w/v). The diluent buffer solution was prepared by adding bovine serum albumin (Sigma) to the assay buffer to give a final concentration of 0.1%(w/v). (4) Pretreatment for FLIPR Assay After removing a medium supernatant from the cell culture plate incubated overnight, the fluorescent dye solution was added to the plate in a volume of 25 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 90 minutes to promote the fluorescent dye uptake in the cell. Meanwhile, the test compounds (i.e., the compounds prepared in Examples) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Nacalai Tesque) were diluted with the diluent buffer solution, to prepare each compound solution at each concentration. In addition, a palmitic acid solution was prepared as a positive control solution (hereinafter abbreviated as PosiC). A 40 μl aliquot of each sample solution prepared as above was added to each well of a 384-well polypropylene plate to prepare a compound plate. Finally, after the sufficient uptake of the fluorescent dye in the cell, the cell plate and the compound plate were set to FLIPRTETRA. (5) FLIPR Assay After the above pretreatment, the change in intracellular calcium level was measured by FLIPRTETRA upon addition of 25 μl of each test compound solution at each concentration. The GPR40 agonist activity of each test compound at each concentration was determined as a relative activity level (% PosiC) with the intracellular calcium level induced by 80 μM palmitic acid (a GPR40 agonist) set to 100%. Next, each compound concentration corresponding to 50% PosiC was calculated based on the % PosiC value, to compare between agonist activities of the test compounds. (6) Result The results are shown in tables 39 to 42. In the tables, “++++” indicates 0.01 μM or more but less than 0.1 μM, “+++” indicates 0.1 μM or more but less than 1 μM, “++” indicates 1 μM or more but less than 10 μM, and “+” indicates 10 μM or more for 50% posiC value.

Ficoll-Conray solution C is prepared by mixing equal volumes of the Ficoll-Conray solutions A and D, and Ficoll-Conray solution B is prepared by mixing equal volumes of the Ficoll-Conray solutions A and C. A culture medium for islets of Langerhans is prepared by supplementing D-MEM (low glucose) (Nikken Bio Medical Laboratory) with 10%(v/v) fetal bovine serum (Biowest) and 1%(v/v) kanamycin sulfate (Invitrogen) (hereinafter referred to as D-MEM (LG)/10% FBS/1% kanamycin). (3) Method for Isolating Islets of Langerhans from Wister Rats Rats are anesthetized with pentobarbital and subjected to laparotomy for exposing the abdominal organs. After the common bile duct is clamped at the duodenal side and then cannulated from the liver side, a collagenase solution (1 mg/ml) is injected slowly to fill the pancreas with. The pancreas is isolated and then incubated at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for about 20 minutes. The digested pancreas is suspended in HBSS/1%(v/v) kanamycin solution and the suspension is transferred to a glass tube. After centrifuging the suspension and then removing the supernatant, the resulting precipitate is suspended in 3.8 mL of Ficoll-Conray solution A. On this, 1.8 mL of Ficoll-Conray solution B, 1.8 mL of Ficoll-Conray solution C and 2.0 mL of Ficoll-Conray solution D are superposed successively. After centrifugation, islets of Langerhans present in the boundary between the solutions C and D are collected into 6 mL of D-MEM (LG)/10% FBS/1% kanamycin, followed by further centrifugation. After removing the supernatant, the precipitate is resuspended in 6 mL of D-MEM (LG)/10% FBS/1% kanamycin. After removing contaminants, the suspension is maintained at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 until it is used for the evaluation of the compounds. (4) Method for Evaluating the Test Compounds on Insulin Secretion D-MEM (LG)/10% FBS/1% kanamycin is added to a 6-well plate (Falcon) in a volume of 1.5 mL/well. After islets of Langerhans of almost the same size are selected with a stereomicroscope, 5 islets are placed into each well. The islets of Langerhans are transferred into another 6-well plate (Falcon) filled with 3.3 mM glucose-contained Krebs Ringer Bicarbonate/0.2%(w/v) bovine serum albumin without free fatty acids (Sigma) (hereinafter referred to as KRB/0.2% BSA solution), and incubated at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 60 minutes, the above KRB/0.2% BSA solution is replaced with 3.3 mM or 11.2 mM glucose-contained KRB/0.2% BSA solution containing the respective test compounds, followed by incubation at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 60 minutes. The respective test compounds are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Nacalai Tesque) and the final concentration of DMSO is 1%(v/v) upon addition of the test compound to the cell. 60 minutes after addition of the respective test compounds, the supernatants are collected.
