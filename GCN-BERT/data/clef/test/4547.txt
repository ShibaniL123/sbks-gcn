The present invention relates to methods of utilizing arylpiperazine derivatives for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. BACKGROUND The primary symptoms of attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) include a persistent pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/ or impulsivity. The symptoms can appear individually, or in combination (Grohoi, J., 2007). The disorder is diagnosed using the American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5, 2013). In order for a person to qualify as having ADD ADHD, they must have had symptoms evident before age 12. However, children do not "grow out of the disorder; it affects bot children and adults. According to the DSM-5 criteria, an adult must meet 5 or more and a child must meet 6 or more of the symptoms for at least 6 months to qualify as having ADD/ADHD. The disorder has a negative impact on the affected person's social, academic, and occupational functioning. In addition, 20%~30% of children with ADD/ ADHD also have a learning disability, including dyslexia (Martin, B., 2007). Other people with ADD/ADHD have associated conditions such as Tourette's Syndrome, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety, depression, or bipolar disorder. There are many theories regarding the cause of ADD/' ADHD. It has a strong genetic basis. The primary genes involved with the cause of ADHD are involved with the brain's ability to produce dopamine, as people with ADD/ADHD typically have decreased levels of dopamine in the brain. Some experts believe that some food additives and sugar exacerbate the condition. However, sugar is not a primary cause of the disorder. Other research indicates that a lack of omega-3 fatty acids (which are important for brain development and function) may be causal of ADD/ADHD symptoms. The addition of fish oil supplements appear to alleviate the disease symptoms in some children, and may boost their scholastic performance. Other factors considered causal for ADD/ADHD include maternal smoking. Women who suffer from ADD/ ADHD are more likely to smoke than women without the disorder; therefore, a genetic link cannot be excluded. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quotes ADD/ ADHD as one of the most prevalent childhood disorders affecting an estimated 6.4 million children (aged 4 to 17 years) have been diagnosed in the US in 201 1. The percentage of children with ADD/ ADHD has increased from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2007 to 11% in 201 1 (CDC ADHD data and statistics, 201 1). The incidence in adults with ADD/ ADHD was reported as 4% to 5% in 2011 (Antshel et al. BMC Medicine 201 1). The disorder is more prevalent in males, children, people with chronic health problems, dysfunctional families, and lower-income families. Children and adults with ADD/ ADHD are treated with the same medications. Parents of children aged 4 to 17 years diagnosed with ADD/ ADHD reported that 6.1% were being treated with medications for the disorder in 2011 compared to 4.8% in 2007 (CDC ADHD: United States, 2003 2011). Effective behavior management techniques are also useful training techniques for children with ADD/ADHD (Antshel et al., 2011). Typical ADD/ADHD medications used to treat ADD/ADHD are categorized in one of four classes of medications: stimulants, (amphetamine or methylphemdate), nonstimulants (including some antihypertensives/central alpha-adrenergic agonists), antidepressants (tricyclics), and atypical antipsychotics. Typical medications used to treat ADD/ ADHD currently on the market that are stimulants include amphetamine, dextroamphetamine mixed salts (Adderall®) and dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine®); typical methylphemdate stimulants include methylphemdate HCl (Ritalin®) and dexmethylphemdate (Focaiiii®); typical nonstimulants include atomoxetine HCl (Strattera®), guanfacine (Tenex® or Intuniv®), and clonidine (Catapres®); typical antidepressants include bupropion HCl (Weilbutrin®), venlafaxine (Effexor®), and imipramine (Tofranil®); and typical antipsychotics include aripiprazole (Ability®). Although there are a wide variety of medications to treat ADD/ ADHD, there are some associated risks with some of the approved medications. The FDA has issued a warning about drug abuse with amphetamine stimulants. There is also a concern regarding the possibility that all amphetamine and methylphemdate stimulants used for ADD/ ADHD may increase the risk of cardiac and psychiatric adverse events. The antidepressants used to treat ADD/ ADHD have shown an increased risk of suicide in adults, especially in the first 1 ~2 months of treatment (Grohol, J., 2007). Only 25% of children treated with medications for ADD/ ADHD have a modest improvement (Antshel et al. BMC Medicine 201 1). There is also a challenge in optimizing the benefit/risk ratio of treatment with careful adj ustment of dosages and combined therapy for comorbid conditions, such as depression (Martin, B., 2007). Even with the knowledge gained to date regarding the disorder and the medications available, the disorder is difficult to treat effective!)'. There is poor compliance to treatment and the psychiatric comorbidities that complicate successful outcomes for patients with ADD/ ADHD. There is a need for a new drug with an acceptable efficacy and reduced adverse effects than the currently available therapies for treating ADD/ADHD. References: 1.

"Therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a patient for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on the compound, the disease and is severity and the age, weight, etc., of the patient to be treated, and can be determined by one of skill in the art without undue experimentation. The present invention is directed to a method for treating attention deficit disorder (ADD)/ attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by administering a compound of Fommla I to a patient. The terms of ADD and ADHD can be used interchangeably. ADHD is a neuropsychiatric disease/disorder, which is caused by the imbalance of key neurochemicals dopamine and serotonin in the brain. Compounds of Formula I have potent binding affinities at the dopamine and serotonin receptors, in addition, Compounds of Formula I exhibit potent binding affinity with partial agonist activity at the dopamine (D?, D3 and D4) and serotonin (5-FITIA and 5-HT2A) receptors, and antagonist activity at the serotonin 5-HT2B, 5-ΗΊΥ, and 5-HT7 receptors. The partial agonist activities for these key highly expressed receptors in the brain cause dopamine-serotonin stabilizing effect in the brain . The inventor has discovered that compounds of Formula I, which has Dopamine D4 receptor antagonist activity, prevents stress induced cognitive deficits (see Dopamine D4 receptor antagonist effect in Arnsten, A.F.T., et al, Neuropsychopharmacology 2000, 23: 405- 410). The inventor has discovered that compounds of Formula I, which has serotonin 5-HT2B receptor antagonist activity, improves cognition and ameliorate ADHD symptoms (see 5- HT?B receptor antagonist effect in Manor, L, eta 1, J Clin Psychiatry 2012, 73: 1517-1523). The in ven tor has further discovered that compounds of Fonnui a I, which has serotonin 5-HT7 receptor antagonist activity, improves cognition and behavioral symptoms (see 5-HT2B receptor antagonist effect in Waters, K. A. et al, Behavioral Research 2012, 228:21 1 -21 8). ADHD has been conceptualized in relation to varying cognitive problems including attention, reward response, executive functioning, and other cognitive processes. By blocking key dopamine (D2, D3 and D4) receptors and serotonin (5-HTJA and 5-HT2A, 5- HT2B, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7) receptors, compounds of Formula I improve the comorbid major conditions of ADHD such as cognition impairment and some of the behavioral symptoms.

The compounds useful for the present invention further pertain to enantiomerically isolated compounds of Formula L The isolated enantiomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I are substantial ly free from one another (i.e., in enantiomeric excess). In other words, the "R" forms of the compounds are substantially free from the "S" forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the "S" forms. Conversely, "S" forms of the compounds are substantially free of "R" forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the "R" forms. In one embodiment of the invention, the isolated enantiomeric compounds are at least about in 80% enantiomeric excess. Thus, for example, the compounds are at least about 90% enantiomeric excess, preferably at least about 95% enantiomeric excess, more preferably at least about 97% enantiomeric excess., or even more preferably, at least 99% or greater than 99% enantiomeric excess. Formula I compounds can be synthesized according U.S. Patent No. 8,188,076, which is incorporated herewith in its entirety. Method of Treating ADD/ADHD The present invention is directed to a method for treating attention deficit disorder (ADD) and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The method comprises the step of administering an effective amount of compound of Formula I to a patient who is suffering from ADHD. The present invention ameliorates at least one clinical symptom and/or at least one physical parameter associated with ADHD. The treated patients improve ADHD rating scale IV (ARS-TV), ADHD self-report scale (ASRS), clinical global impression (CGI), and/or cognitive functions. ADHD rating scale IV (ARS-TV) rates the following behaviors: 1. Fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in work. 2. Fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat. 3. Has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities. 4. Leaves seat in situations in which remaining seated is expected, 5. Does not seem to listen when spoken to directly. 6. Runs about or climbs excessively in situations in which it is inappropriate. 7. Does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish work. 8, Has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly. 9. Has difficulty organizing tasks and activities. 10. Is "on the go" or acts as if "driven by a motor." 11. Avoids tasks that require sustained mental effort. 12. Talks excessively. 13. Loses things necessary for tasks or activities. 14. Blurts out answers before questions have been completed. 15. Is easily distracted. 16. Has difficulty awaiting turn. 17. Is forgetful in daily activities. 18. Interrupts or intrudes on others. Kessier et al {Psychological Medicine, 35 :245-256, 2005) report the WHO adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS), for use in the general population. The ASRS Symptom Checklist is a self-reported questionnaire used to assist in the diagnosis of adult ADHD. The clinical global impression - improvement scale (CGI-I) is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention, and rated as: 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. When used to treat ADHD, one or more compound of Formula I can be administered alone, or in combination with other agents, to a patient. The patient may be an animal, preferably a mammal, and more preferably a human. Formula I compounds are preferably administered orally. Formula I compounds may also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.). Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, (e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc.) that can be used to administer a compound and/or composition of the invention. Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intracerebral, intravabinal, transdermal, rectally, by inhalation, or topically, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes or skin. Transdermal administration may be preferred for young children. Formula I compounds can be delivered via sustained release systems, preferably oral sustained release systems. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see, Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321 :574). In one embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see "Medical Applications of Controlled Release," Langer and Wise (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol Chern. 23:61 ; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228: 190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al, 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71 : 105). In a preferred embodiment, polymeric materials are used for oral sustained release delivery. Preferred polymers include sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyicelluiose and hydroxyethylcellulose (most preferred, hydroxypropylmethyicelluiose). Other preferred celiulose ethers have been described in the art (Bamba et al., Int. J. Pharm., 1979, 2, 307). In one embodiment, enteric-coated preparations can be used for oral sustained release administration. Preferred coatmg materials mclude polymers with a pH-dependent solubility (i.e., pH-controlied release), polymers with a slow or pH -dependent rate of swelling, dissolution or erosion (i.e., time controlled release), polymers that are degraded by enzymes (i.e., enzyme controlled release) and polymers that form firm layers that are destroyed by an increase in pressure (i.e., pressure-controlled release). In still another embodiment, osmotic delivery systems are used for oral sustained release administration (Verma et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm., 2000, 26:695-708). In a preferred embodiment, OROS® osmotic delivery systems are used for oral sustained release delivery devices (See for example, Theeuwes et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,845,770; and Theeuwes et ιύ . U.S. Pat. No. 3,916,899). In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of the target of the compounds and/or composition of the invention, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (See, e.g., Goodson, in "Medical Applications of Controlled Release," supra, vol, 2, pp. 115-138 ( 1984)). Other control led-release systems discussed in Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533 may also be used. Formula I compounds may be cleaved either chemically and/or enzymatically. One or more enzymes present in the stomach, intestinal lumen, intestinal tissue, blood, liver, brain or any other suitable tissue of a mammal may enzymatically cleave the compounds and/or compositions of the in vention. Pharmaceutical Formulation of the Invention The present pharmaceutical formulation contains a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formula I, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. When administered to a patient, the pharmaceutical formulation is preferably sterile. Water is a preferred vehicle when the compound of the invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid vehicles, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles also include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol nionostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present agents, or pH buffering agents. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention may be manufactured by means of conventional mixing, dissol ving, granulating, dragee-making levigating, and emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or iyophiiizing process. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of compounds of the invention into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. The present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, and capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a capsule (see e.g., Grosswald et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical vehicles have been described in the art (see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, 17* Edition, 1985). Preferred compositions of the invention are formulated for oral delivery, particularly for oral sustained release administration. Compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions may contain one or more optionally agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wmtergreen, or cherry coloring agents and preserving agents to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions may be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmoticaily active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compounds of the invention. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard vehicles such as ma nitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Such vehicles are preferably of pharmaceutical grade. For oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers, excipients or diluents include water , saline, alkyleneglycols (e.g., propylene glycol), polyalkylene glycols (e.g., polyethylene glycoi) oils, alcohols, slightly acidic buffers between pH 4 and pH 6 (e.g., acetate, citrate, ascorbate at between about mM to about 50 rnM) etc. Additionally, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, bile salts, acylcamitmes and the like may be added. Compositions for administration via other routes may also be contemplated. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, etc. formulated in conventional manner. Liquid drug formulations suitable for use with nebulizers and liquid spray devices and EHD aerosol devices will typically include a compound of the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a liquid such as alcohol, water, polyethylene glycol or a perfluorocarbon. Optionally, another material may be added to alter the aerosol properties of the solution or suspension of compounds of the invention. Preferably, this material is liquid such as alcohol, glycol, polyglycol or fatty acid. Other methods of fomiulating liquid drug solutions or suspension suitable for use in aerosol devices are known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Biesalski, U.S. Pat. No. 5, 112,598; Biesalski, U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,611). A compound of the invention may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa, butter or other glycerides. In addition to the formulations described previously, a compound of the invention may also be formulated as depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, a compound of the invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. Dosage for the Treatment The amount of Formula I compound administered is dependent on, among other factors, the subject being treated, and the weight of the subject, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, the dosage may be delivered in a pharmaceutical composition by a single administration, by mul tiple applications or controlled release. In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are delivered by oral sustained release administration. In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are administered twice per day, and preferably, once per day. Dosing may be repeated intermittently, may be provided alone or in combination with other drugs, and may continue as long as required for effective treatment of the disease state or disorder. The compounds of Formula I may be administered in the range 0.1 -500 mg, preferably 1-100, or 0.5-50 mg per day given in one or more doses. For example, the compounds are administered 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 35 mg or 50 mg per day. The actual dosage depends on the age and body weight of the subject. In general, under the age group 12 years, the daily dosage is between 0.5 to 2.5 mg. Between the age group of 12-18 years, the daily dosage is 2.5 to 5 mg. Above the age group 18 years, the daily dosage Combination Therapy In certain embodiments of the present invention, the compounds of the invention can be used in combination therapy with at least one other therapeutic agent. Formula I compounds and the therapeutic agent can act additively or synergistically. In one embodiment, Formula I compoimd is administered concurrently with the administration of another therapeutic agent, which can be part of the same compositi on of Formul a I compound. In another embodiment, a composition comprising a compoimd of the invention is administered prior or subsequent to administration of another therapeutic agent. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples. Example 1. In Vitro Pharmacology Results Two arylpiperazine derivatives of Formula (I) were tested in the in vitro phamiacological assays to evaluate their activities for dopamine D2 and D4, and serotonin HT , 5-HT2A, 5~HT?B, 5-HTe and 5-HT7 receptors. Methods employed to evaluate the test compounds A and B in radioligand binding assays were adopted from the scientific literature references as shown in Table 1 to maximize reliability and reproducibility. Reference standards were run as an integral part of each assay to ensure the validity of the results obtained. Ki values were calculated using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng, Y., Prusoff, W.H. Biochem Pharmacol 1973, 22: 3099-3108). Compound A = 6-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin- l-yl)butoxy)-2H- benzo[b] [ 1 ,4]oxazin-3(~ 4H)-one hydrochloride. Compound B = 6-(4-(4-(2,3-dichlorophenyi)piperazin-l ~yl)butoxy)~2H~ benzo[b] [ 1 ,4]oxazin- 3(4H)-one hydrochloride. Table 1. Literature References in Table 1 : 1.
