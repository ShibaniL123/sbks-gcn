Step 2: Preparation of (5-fluoro-2-nitrophenyl) (pyridine-2-yl)methanone
1.50 g (6.04 mmol) of (5-fluoro-2-nitrophenyl) (pyridine-2-yl)methanol prepared in step 1 was dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (30 mL), to which MnO2 (6 equivalent) was added, followed by stirring at room temperature for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered with celite pad and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained compound was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 10/1-hexane/ethylacetate, 4/1) to give 1.48 g of the target compound (5-fluoro-2-phenyl) (pyridine-2-yl)methanone as a pale brown solid (6.01 mmol, yield: 100%).
