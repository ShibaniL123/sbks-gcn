Preparation 2: Synthesis of Intermediate 2 {methyl 4-(4-(4-iodophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate}
To a solution of 4-(4-iodophenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (10 g, 1 eq) in a mixture of DMF (100 ml)/MeOH (50 ml) was added with methyl 4-bromo-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate (12.74 g, 1.5 eq), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (16.3 ml, 3 eq) and stirred for 24 hr at 60Â° C. The mixture was cooled down to room temperature, extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (11 g, 74%).
