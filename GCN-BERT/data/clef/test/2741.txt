FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to molybdenum (Mo) complexes and methods of preparing thin films by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD) using such complexes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various organometallic precursors are used to form thin metal films. A variety of techniques have been used for the deposition of thin films. These include reactive sputtering, ion-assisted deposition, sol-gel deposition, CVD (also known as metalorganic CVD or MOCVD), and ALD (also known as atomic layer epitaxy). The CVD and ALD processes are being increasingly used as they have the advantages of good compositional control, high film uniformity, good control of doping, and, significantly, they give excellent conformal step coverage on highly non-planar microelectronics device geometries. CVD is a chemical process whereby precursors are used to form a thin film on a substrate. In a typical CVD process, the precursors are passed over a substrate (e.g., a wafer) in a low pressure or ambient pressure reaction chamber. The precursors react and/or decompose on the substrate surface creating a thin film of deposited material. Volatile by-products are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber. The deposited film thickness can be difficult to control because it depends on coordination of many parameters such as temperature, pressure, gas flow volumes and uniformity, chemical depletion effects, and time. ALD is also a method for the deposition of thin films. It is a self-limiting, sequential, unique film growth technique based on surface reactions that can provide precise thickness control and deposit conformal thin films of materials provided by precursors onto substrates of varying compositions. In ALD, the precursors are separated during the reaction. The first precursor is passed over the substrate producing a monolayer on the substrate. Any excess unreacted precursor is pumped out of the reaction chamber. A second precursor is then passed over the substrate and reacts with the first precursor, forming a second monolayer of film over the first-formed monolayer of film on the substrate surface. This cycle is repeated to create a film of desired thickness. ALD film growth is self-limiting and based on surface reactions, creating uniform depositions that can be controlled at the nanometer-thickness scale. Thin films have a variety of important applications, such as nanotechnology and fabrication of semiconductor devices. Examples of such applications include, conductive films, high-refractive index optical coatings, corrosion-protection coatings, photocatalytic self-cleaning glass coatings, biocompatible coatings, dielectric capacitor layers and gate dielectric insulating films in field-effect transistors (FET), capacitor electrodes, gate electrodes, adhesive diffusion barriers and integrated circuits. Thin films are also used in microelectronics applications, such as the high-κ dielectric oxide for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) applications and the ferroelectric perovskites used in infra-red detectors and non-volatile ferroelectric random access memories (NV-FeRAMs). The continual decrease in the size of microelectronics components has increased the need for the use of such thin films. Oxides and nitrides of molybdenum have numerous important applications. For example, molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) displays unusual metal-like conductivity and has found applications in hydrocarbon oxidation catalysts, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes, and high capacity reversible lithium ion battery (LIB) anodes. See, for example, Ellefson, C. A., et al., J. Mater. Sci. 2012, 47, 2057-2071. Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) exhibits interesting electrochromic and catalytic properties and has found applications in nano-structured gas sensors and in solid-state lithium ion batteries. See, for example, Diskus, M., et al., J. Mater. Chem. 2011, 21, 705-710. Finally, thin films of transition metal nitrides have long been known to generally possess good mechanical and chemical stability. Films of molybdenum nitride (MoN and/or Mo2N) have been studied for applications including microelectronic diffusion barriers, high-Tc superconductors, and tribological and protective coatings. See, for example, Miikkulainen, V., et al., Chem. Mater. 2007, 19, 263-269. Theopold, K. H., et al. report the synthesis and isolation of the Mo complex CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl). Science of Synthesis, 2003, 229-281. Green, J., et al. report the synthesis and isolation of the Mo complex, (C6H6)Mo(η3-allyl)2. J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. 1973, 1403-1408 and J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. 1973, 1952-1954. Current molybdenum precursors for use in CVD and ALD do not provide the required performance to implement new processes for fabrication of next generation devices, such as semiconductors. For example, improved thermal stability, higher volatility, increased vapor pressures, and increased deposition rates are needed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In various aspects of the invention, Mo (II) complexes, methods of making such complexes, and methods of using such complexes to form Mo, MoN, Mo2N, MoN/Mo2N, MoO2, MOO3, and MoO2/MoO3 films are provided. In one embodiment, the methods of the invention can be used to create or grow Mo-containing thin films which display conductive properties. As used herein, the term “precursor” refers to an organometallic molecule, complex and/or compound which is passed over a substrate to form a thin film by a deposition process, for example, by CVD or ALD. As used herein, the term “vapor deposition process” is used to refer to any type of vapor deposition technique such as CVD or ALD. In various embodiments of the invention, CVD may take the form of conventional (i.e., continuous flow) CVD, liquid injection CVD, or photo-assisted CVD. CVD may also take the form of a pulsed technique, i.e., pulsed CVD. In other embodiments, ALD may take the form of conventional (i.e., pulsed injection) ALD, liquid injection ALD, photo-assisted ALD, or plasma-assisted ALD. The term “vapor deposition process” further includes various vapor deposition techniques described in Chemical Vapour Deposition: Precursors, Processes, and Applications; Jones, A. C.; Hitchman, M. L., Eds. The Royal Society of Chemistry: Cambridge, 2009; Chapter 1, pp 1-36. The term “Cp” refers to a cyclopentadienyl (C5H5) ligand which is bound to molybdenum. As used herein, all five carbon atoms of the Cp ligand are bound to the metal center in η5-coordination by π bonding, therefore the complexes of the invention are it complexes. The term “allyl” refers to an allyl (C3H5) ligand which is bound to molybdenum. As used herein, the allyl ligand has a resonating double bond and all three carbon atoms of the allyl ligand are bound to the metal center in η3-coordination by π bonding. Therefore, the complexes of the invention are π complexes. Both of these features are represented by the dashed bonds. When the allyl portion is substituted by one R1 group, the R1 group replaces an allylic hydrogen to become [R1C3H4]; when substituted with two R groups R1 and R2, it becomes [R1R2C3H3] where R1 and R2 are the same or different, and so forth. The term “alkyl” refers to a saturated hydrocarbon chain of 1 to about 8 carbon atoms in length, such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. The alkyl group may be straight-chain or branched-chain. “Alkyl” is intended to embrace all structural isomeric forms of an alkyl group. For example, as used herein, propyl encompasses both n-propyl and isopropyl; butyl encompasses n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl. Further, as used herein, “Me” refers to methyl, and “Et” refers to ethyl, “i-Pr” refers to isopropyl, “t-Bu” refers to tert-butyl, and “Np” refers to neopentyl. It should also be noted that C2 is intended to refer to an ethyl group, and not dimethyl. Deposition of Mo metal, molybdenum nitrides such as MoN and Mo2N (or mixtures of such molybdenum nitrides), and molybdenum oxides such as MoO2 and MoO3 (or mixtures of such molybdenum oxides) is difficult to achieve due to stability issues, being either unstable or too stable for deposition. The organometallic complexes disclosed in the embodiments of the invention allow for control of physical properties as well as provide for increased stability and simple high yield synthesis. In a first embodiment, an organometallic complex is provided corresponding in structure to Formula I: wherein R1 and R3 are independently and at each occurrence alkyl; R2 is alkyl; R4 is independently and at each occurrence selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl; x and z are independently zero, 1, or 2; y is zero or 1; and n is zero to 5.

In another embodiment, a mixture and/or combination of two or more organometallic complexes of Formula I and II is provided. In another embodiment, a method of forming a molybdenum-containing film by a vapor deposition process is provided. The method comprises vaporizing at least one organometallic complex corresponding in structure to Formula I, Formula II, or a combination thereof, as disclosed herein. For example, this may include (1) vaporizing the at least one complex and (2) delivering the at least one complex to a substrate surface or passing the at least one complex over a substrate (and/or decomposing the at least one complex on the substrate surface). In a particular embodiment, the organometallic complexes may be dissolved in an appropriate hydrocarbon or amine solvent. Appropriate hydrocarbon solvents include, but are not limited to aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, heptane, and nonane; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene and xylene; aliphatic and cyclic ethers, such as diglyme, triglyme, and tetraglyme. Examples of appropriate amine solvents include, without limitation, octylamine and N,N-dimethyldodecylamine. For example, the organometallic complex may be dissolved in toluene to yield a solution with a concentration of about 0.05 M to about 1 M. In another embodiment, at least one complex corresponding in structure to Formula I or Formula II may be delivered “neat” (undiluted by a carrier gas) to a substrate.

The ALD and CVD methods of the invention encompass various types of ALD and CVD processes such as, but not limited to, continuous or pulsed injection processes, liquid injection processes, photo-assisted processes, and plasma-assisted processes. For purposes of clarity, the methods of the present invention specifically include direct liquid injection processes. For example, in direct liquid injection CVD (“DLI-CVD”), a solid or liquid complex may be dissolved in a suitable solvent and the solution formed therefrom injected into a vaporization chamber as a means to vaporize the complex. The vaporized complex is then transported/delivered to the substrate. In general, DLI-CVD may be particularly useful in those instances where a complex displays relatively low volatility or is otherwise difficult to vaporize. In one embodiment, conventional or pulsed injection CVD is used to form a molybdenum-containing thin film by vaporizing and/or passing at least one complex according to Formula I and/or Formula II as disclosed herein over a substrate. For conventional and pulsed CVD processes see, for example, Smith, Donald (1995). Thin-Film Deposition: Principles and Practice. McGraw-Hill.

In this regard, the co-reactant may be deposited or delivered to or passed over a substrate, independently or in combination with the at least one complex. Examples of such co-reactants include, but are not limited to hydrogen, hydrogen plasma, oxygen, air, water, H2O2, ammonia, a hydrazine, a borane, a silane, such as a trisilane, ozone or any combination thereof. Examples of suitable boranes include, without limitation, hydridic (i.e., reducing) boranes such as borane, diborane, triborane and the like.

In another embodiment, a mixed-metal film can be formed by a vapor deposition process which vaporizes a complex of Formula I and/or Formula II disclosed herein in combination, but not necessarily at the same time, with a co-complex having a metal different from molybdenum. A variety of substrates can be used in the methods of the present invention. For example, the complexes according to Formula I and/or Formula II as disclosed herein may be delivered or passed over a variety of substrates such as, but not limited to, silicon such as Si(100), silicon oxide, silicon nitride, tantalum, tantalum nitride, copper, ruthenium, titanium nitride, tungsten, and tungsten nitride. In a particular embodiment, the methods of the invention are utilized for applications such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and complementary metal oxide semi-conductor (CMOS) for memory and logic applications, on substrates such as silicon chips. Any of the molybdenum complexes described herein may be used to prepare thin films of molybdenum metal, molybdenum oxides, and/or molybdenum nitrides. Such films may find application as oxidation catalysts, anode materials (e.g., SOFC or LIB anodes), conducting layers, sensors, diffusion barriers/coatings, super- and non-superconducting materials/coatings, tribological coatings, and/or, protective coatings. It is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the film properties (e.g., conductivity) will depend on a number of factors, such as the metal(s) used for deposition, the presence or absence of co-reactants and/or co-complexes, the thickness of the film created, the parameters and substrate employed during growth and subsequent processing. Fundamental differences exist between the thermally-driven CVD process and the reactivity-driven ALD process. The requirements for precursor properties to achieve optimum performance vary greatly. In CVD a clean thermal decomposition of the complex to deposit the required species onto the substrate is critical. However, in ALD such a thermal decomposition is to be avoided at all costs. In ALD, the reaction between the input reagents must be rapid at the surface resulting in formation of the target material on the substrate. However, in CVD, any such reaction between species is detrimental due to their gas phase mixing before reaching the substrate, which could lead to particle formation. In general it is accepted that good CVD precursors do not necessarily make good ALD precursors due to the relaxed thermal stability requirement for CVD precursors. In this invention, Formula I and II molybdenum complexes possess enough thermal stability and reactivity toward select co-reactants to function as ALD precursors, and they possess clean decomposition pathways at higher temperatures to form desired materials through CVD processes as well. Therefore, molybdenum complexes described by Formula I and II are useful as viable ALD and CVD precursors. EXAMPLES The following examples are merely illustrative, and do not limit this disclosure in any way. Unless otherwise noted, all manipulations were performed under an inert atmosphere (e.g, purified nitrogen or argon) using techniques for handling air-sensitive materials commonly known in the art (e.g., “Schlenk techniques”). Example 1 Preparation of CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) A 2 L round bottom flask equipped with magnetic stirrer was charged with Mo(CO)6 (30 g, 0.114 mol) followed by acetonitrile (450 mL). The mixture was refluxed for 4 hours under nitrogen atmosphere (until no more Mo(CO)6 sublimed out), giving a yellow colored solution. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature (RT), and then 3-chloro-2-methylpropene (22.2 mL, 0.228 mol) was added slowly by syringe. During addition, an orange color was formed and CO evolution was observed. The mixture was stirred overnight at 50° C. and then allowed to settle. The resulting yellow precipitate was cannula filtered, then washed with acetonitrile (5 mL). After drying under reduced pressure, Mo(CO)2(MeCN)2(η3-2-methylallyl)Cl was obtained as a yellow powder, yield 29 g (80%). A solution of NaCp was prepared by drop-wise addition of freshly cracked cyclopentadiene (5.9 g, 0.089 mol) to a suspension of sodium hydride (2.1 g, 0.089 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (200 mL), then stirred at RT until H2 evolution had ceased. The resulting solution was added to a solution of Mo(CO)2(MeCN)2(η3-2-methylallyl)Cl (29 g, 0.089 mol) in THF (350 mL), slowly by cannula. The resulting dark-red solution was stirred overnight at RT, wherein a pale precipitate of NaCl formed. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and then the residue was extracted with hexane (2×0.5 L). The yellow/brown colored solution was filtered and then concentrated to approximately 100 mL, at which point a yellow solid had precipitated out. This solid was collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure. A further batch of product was obtained by concentrating the solution down further and cooling in the freezer.

The resulting solution was added to a solution of Mo(CO)2(MeCN)2(η3-2-methylallyl)Cl (25 g, 0.077 mol) in THF (400 mL), slowly by cannula. The resulting dark-red solution was stirred overnight at RT, wherein a pale precipitate of NaCl formed. The mixture was cannula-filtered and the resulting clear solution evaporated, affording a dark-red liquid. The residue was extracted with hexane (300 mL). The reddish-brown solution was filtered and then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The red/brown liquid was distilled at 110-120° C. (0.5 Torr) in short-path distillation apparatus, affording MeCpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) as an orange liquid/low-melting solid, 15 g (68%). 1H NMR (C6D6): δ 1.30 (s, 2H, allyl-H), 1.49 (s, 3H, Cp-Me), 1.70 (s, 3H, allyl-Me), 2.78 (s, 2H, allyl-H), 4.49 (m, 2H, Cp-H), 4.57 (m, 2H, Cp-H) ppm.

Example 3 Preparation of i-PrCpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) Mo(CO)2(MeCN)2(η3-2-methylallyl)Cl was prepared as described in Example 1 above. A solution of Na(i-Pr)Cp (sodium isopropylcyclopentadienide, 22 g, 0.169 mol) in THF (150 mL) was added to a solution of Mo(CO)2(MeCN)2(η3-2-methylallyl)Cl (54.4 g, 0.168 mol) in THF (500 mL), slowly by cannula. The resulting dark-red solution was stirred overnight at RT, wherein a pale precipitate of NaCl formed. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting dark-red/brown oily residue was extracted with hexane (300 mL) and the combined extracts filtered by cannula. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting red liquid was distilled at 110-130° C. (0.5 Torr), affording i-PrCpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) as a red liquid, 27 g (43% from Mo(CO)6). 1H NMR (C6D6): δ 0.90 (d, 6H, CHMe2), 1.51 (s, 2H, allyl-H), 1.69 (s, 3H, allyl-Me), 2.18 (sept, 1H, CHMe2), 2.69 (s, 2H, allyl-H), 4.47 (m, 2H, Cp-H), 4.59 (m, 2H, Cp-H) ppm.

The mixture was refluxed for 8 hours under nitrogen atmosphere, giving a yellow colored solution. The solution was allowed to cool to RT, and then 2-bromomethyl-3,3-dimethyl-1-butene (8 g, 0.045 mol) was added slowly by syringe. During addition, a red solution was formed and CO evolution was observed. The mixture was stirred for 48 hours at 60° C. The resulting solution was cooled to 30° C. and then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, affording Mo(CO)2(MeCN)2(η3-2-tert-butylallyl)Br as an orange solid, yield 16.2 g (94%). A solution of NaMeCp was prepared by drop-wise addition of freshly cracked methylcyclopentadiene (3.2 g, 0.04 mol) to a suspension of sodium hydride (1 g, 0.041 mmol) in THF (100 mL), then stirring at 20° C. until H2 evolution had ceased. The resulting solution was slowly added to a solution of Mo(CO)2(MeCN)2(η3-2-tert-butylallyl)Br (16.2 g, 0.039 mol) in THF (200 mL).

In a glovebag, Mo(η6-EtxC6H6-x)2 (10.0 g) was loaded into a 1 L Schlenk flask. The flask was equipped with a magnetic stirbar, sealed with a rubber septum and removed from the glovebag. The flask was then pump/purged with vacuum/N2 three times before being placed under a dynamic N2 atmosphere. The flask was charged with 250 mL of anhydrous toluene via cannula and the dark-green mixture was magnetically stirred. Allyl chloride (4.0 mL, 49 mmol) was slowly added to the stirring Mo(EtxC6H6-x)2/toluene mixture and the resulting reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The volatiles were removed from the resulting dark-purple solution under reduced pressure giving a dark-purple oil. The dark-purple oil, assumed to be [(η6-EtxC6H6-x)(η3-allyl)Mo(μ-Cl)]2, was extracted with 2×250 mL absolute ethanol and filtered using a cannula filter. The purple filtrates were combined and the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The mixture was slurried in 500 mL anhydrous hexane and the volatiles again removed under reduced pressure. The dark-purple oil was dissolved in 500 mL of anhydrous THF and the mixture was magnetically stirred. Allylmagnesium chloride (2.0 M in THF, 18.0 mL, 36.0 mmol) was slowly added to the reaction mixture via syringe. The mixture was stirred overnight. The brown reaction mixture was then cooled to −30° C. and excess allylmagnesium chloride was quenched with a few drops of water added via syringe. The brown suspension was filtered via cannula filtration and the volatiles were removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure. The mixture was slurried in 500 mL anhydrous hexane and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure (to ensure complete removal of THF). The product was then extracted with 2×500 mL of anhydrous hexane and filtered via cannula filtration. The filtrates were combined and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure giving 4.0 g of a dark-purple oil. The dark-purple oil was distilled at 130-140° C. and 0.5 Torr to give 0.3 g (3%) of the desired product as a yellow-orange oil. The desired product is a mixture of species and exhibits a complex 1H NMR. 1H NMR (C6D6): δ 0.7-1.8 (m, ethyl and 1-allyl-H), 2.4-2.6 (m, 1-allyl-H), 3.7-4.1 (m, 2-allyl-H), 6.8-7.2 (m, aryl-H) ppm.

FIG. 19 is XPS spectra and compositional analysis of the film deposited on hydrogen terminated Si(100) after sputtering with argon ions for two minutes. In further growth studies using oxygen as a co-reactant (1.0 s pulse length), a plot of growth rate versus CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) precursor pulse length at a substrate (deposition) temperature of 215° C. was generated. As shown in FIG. 20, self-limiting film growth behavior occurs at Mo pulse lengths of ≧1.0 s. Example 6G Deposition of Mo by Atomic Layer Deposition with Water as a Co-Reactant A Mo-containing film was deposited by atomic layer deposition with the following parameters: Substrate temperature: 225° C. Co-reactant: water Nitrogen Purge Time: 5.0 s Pulse Train: 2.0 s Mo complex/5.0 s N2 purge/1.0 s Total cycles: 2000 As shown in FIG. 21, when water was used as the co-reactant (1.0 s pulse length), an ALD window was observed to be between ˜195° C. and ˜275° C., with a constant growth rate of 0.24 Å/cycle. Thus, the ALD window obtained with water as a co-reactant was significantly wider than when oxygen was used as a co-reactant. Example 7 Atomic Layer Deposition Experiments with Ozone Co-Reactant In all deposition experiments in this example, CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) was used as the molybdenum source and ozone was used as the co-reactant. MeCpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl), i-PrCpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl), or MeCpMo(CO)2(η3-2-tert-butylallyl) may also be used as the molybdenum source. FIG. 22 is a schematic of a reactor used for ALD experiments in this example. The Mo source was kept at 90° C. with a nitrogen carrier gas flow of 80 sccms during the experiments. The ozone co-reactant concentration was 260 g/Nm3, at a flow rate of 60 sccms, and was pulsed for 1.0 s. In all the examples, the baseline reactor pressure was between 1.2 and 1.5 Torr. The substrates used were 100 nm SiO2 on Si (SiO2 1 K) and hydrogen terminated Si(100) (Si(H-term)). Deposition occurred on all substrates in the examples described below. XPS spectra and cross sectional SEM micrographs for films deposited on Si were analyzed. As a measure of uniformity, film thicknesses were measured by cross-sectional SEM at many different points on the substrate. Example 7A Deposition of Mo by Atomic Layer Deposition with CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl), Using Ozone as a Co-Reactant Molybdenum oxide films were deposited by atomic layer deposition with the following parameters: Substrate temperature: 150° C. Co-reactant: Ozone Nitrogen Purge Time: 5.0 s Pulse Train: 1.0 s Mo precursor/5.0 s N2 purge/1.0 s ozone/5.0 s N2 purge Total cycles: 1000 FIG. 23 shows Mo surface saturation data demonstrating growth rate vs. Mo precursor pulse length, on two different substrate surfaces (SiO2 1 K and Si(H-term)), for CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl). In each case, the substrate temperature was 175° C. and ozone was pulsed for 1.0 s. FIG. 23 shows that, for each substrate, surface saturation occurs after 0.5 s, indicating that 175° C. film growth proceeds by ALD. FIG. 24 is a graphical representation of Mo ALD curve data demonstrating growth rate vs. deposition (substrate) temperature, on SiO2 1 K and Si(H-term), for CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl). In each case, the Mo precursor pulse length and ozone co-reactant pulse length were 2.0 s and 1.0 s, respectively. FIG. 24 shows an ALD window from ˜150-175° C. with a constant growth rate of 0.52 Å/cycle (Si(H-term)) and 0.50 Å/cycle (SiO2 1 K). FIG. 25 is a graphical representation of Mo 3d ionization data demonstrating intensity vs. binding energy, at 150° C., 200° C., and 250° C., for CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl). FIG. 26 is a graphical representation of 0 is ionization data demonstrating intensity vs. binding energy, at varying temperature, for CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl). The shaded boxes in FIGS. 25 and 26 represent the literature values for ionizations belonging to Mo 3d 3/2 and Mo 3d 5/2 (FIG. 25), and O is (FIG. 26). For films sputtered for 2 minutes, the % at. carbon of the film was determined to be 5.6 (150° C.), 3.3 (200° C.), and 3.7 (250° C.) and O/Mo was determined to be 3.3/1 (150° C.), 3.1/1 (200° C.), and 3.0/1 (250° C.). Thus, the XPS data shows successful deposition of MoO3 by ALD. FIG. 27 is a SEM micrograph of a 37.5 nm MoO3 film deposited on hydrogen terminated Si(100) at 175° C., using CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) as the molybdenum source and ozone as a co-reactant. FIG. 28 is a AFM micrograph of a MoO3 film deposited on hydrogen terminated Si(100) at 150° C., using CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) as the molybdenum source and ozone as a co-reactant. The RMS surface roughness was determined to be 0.72 nm. FIG. 29 is a AFM micrograph of a MoO3 film deposited on hydrogen terminated Si(100) at 250° C., using CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) as the molybdenum source and ozone as a co-reactant. The RMS surface roughness was determined to be 15.74 nm. A number of conclusions were made based upon the experiments in this example. First, low carbon containing MoO3 thin films could be grown by ALD using CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) and ozone at substrate temperatures of 125-225° C. An ALD window was observed between 150-175° C. Within the ALD window, the deposited films were smooth and featureless, indicative of ALD growth. MoO3 films deposited above the ALD window (250° C.) were very rough, suggesting decomposition of the Mo precursor. CpMo(CO)2(η3-2-methylallyl) (and structurally similar precursors) should be suitable for the deposition of molybdenum nitride, lower valent molybdenum oxides, and molybdenum sulfide.
