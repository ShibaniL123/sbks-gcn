Step 2.
A mixture of 2-butyl-5-hydroxyisoindoline-1,3-dione (7.00 g 32 mmol), pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (3.87 g, 10 mmol), potassium carbonate (6.90 g, 50 mmol), and DMF (15 mL) was stirred under argon and healed at 110Â° C. for 24 h and poured onto crushed ice (200 g). When the ice melted, the obtained precipitate was filtered off, washed with water (200 mL) and dried. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, DCM/ethyl acetate, 95:5) to give Compound B15, 5,5'-((2-(bromomethyl)-2-(((2-butyl-1,3-dioxoisoindolin-5-yl)oxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(2-butylisoindoline-1,3-dione), (1.96 g, 24% yield).
