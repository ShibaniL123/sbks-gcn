(E)-methyl3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((5S,7R/5R,7S)-6-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-2,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrooxazolo[5,4-g]isoquinolin-5-yl)phenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-7-amino-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy -3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 80b (100 mg, 0.223 mmol), trimethyl orthoacetate (80 mg, 0.669 mmol) and pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (6 mg, 0.022 mmol) were dissolved in 3 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction solution was warmed up to 80°C and stirred for 1 hour at 80°C, then cooled to room temperature, added with water, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by thin layer chromatograph with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((5S,7R/5R,7S)-6-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-2,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetr ahydrooxazolo[5,4-g]isoquinolin-5-yl)phenyl)acrylate 80c (20 mg, yield 19%) as a yellow solid.
