These compounds are useful as modulators of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductor Regulator (CFTR). The present invention also relates to methods of treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in a patient. These compounds may be used alone or in combination with one or more secondary active agents. BACKGROUND [0002] Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases in Caucasians. Approximately one in 3,500 children in the US is born with CF each year. It is a disease that affects all racial and ethnic groups, but is more common among Caucasians. An estimated 30,000 American adults and children have CF (70,000 worldwide), and the median predicted age of survival is 36.8 years (CFF Registry Report 2011, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Bethesda, MD). CF is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease caused by a mutation in the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein. More than 1,000 disease-associated mutations have been discovered in the CFTR gene with the most common mutation being a deletion of the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del). This defect is present in 70% of CF patients. The CFTR protein is located on the apical membrane and is responsible for chloride transport across epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces. Currently there is no curative treatment for CF; therefore, new therapies are needed for the disease. [0003] There is a significant need for novel compounds and methods for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in a patient. The present invention satisfies these needs.

Overview of the Invention [0011] Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal genetic disease affecting 70,000 people worldwide, Approximately one in 3,500 children in the US is born with CF each year. It is a disease that affects all racial and ethnic groups, but is more common among Caucasians. An estimated 30,000 American adults and children have CF, and the median predicted age of survival is 36.8 years (CFF Registry Report 2011, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Bethesda, MD). CF is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease caused by a mutation in the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR aids the regulation of epithelial salt and water transport in multiple organs, including the lung, pancreas, liver, and intestinal tract. Clinical manifestations of CF include abnormal sweat electrolytes, chronic and progressive respiratory disease, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and infertility; however, it is lung disease that is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. In the lung, the loss of CFTR mediated CI" secretion is believed to cause airway surface dehydration due to both a decrease in CFTR-mediated CI" and fluid secretion and a secondary increase in epithelial Na " channel (E aC) -mediated Na"1" and fluid absorption. This imbalance results in dehydration of the airway surface, and likely contributes to the deleterious cascade of mucus accumulation, infection, inflammation, and destruction that characterizes CF lung disease. The accumulation of mucus leads to plugging in the passageways in the lung and other organs, such as the pancreas. [0012] Current therapies to treat CF lung disease, including mucolytics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-infectives and nutritional agents, target the downstream disease consequences chat are secondary to the loss of CFTR function. Since the median predicted survival age is currently about 37 years, there is a large medical need for more efficacious therapies chat address the underlying defect of CF. [0013] To address this need, there has been increased interest in small-molecule therapies that increase CFTR function because such an approach could address the consequences of CFTR dysfunction as well as slow the progression of the disease. Such therapies are broadly classified as CFTR. modulators and include CFTR activators, potentiators, correctors, and antagonists. CFTR activators act on their own to stimulate CFTR -mediated ion transport and include agents that increase cAMP levels, such as Î²- adrenergic agonists, adenylate cyclase activators, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors. CFTR potentiators act in the presence of endogenous or pharmacological CFTR activators to increase the channel gating activity of cell-surface localized CFTR, resulting in enhanced ion transport. CFTR correctors act by increasing the delivery and amount of functional CFTR protein to the cell surface, resulting in enhanced ion transport. Depending on the molecular consequence of the mutation and disease severity, CFTR activators, potentiators, and correctors may be coadministered to maximize clinical efficacy or therapeutic window, if needed, CFTR antagonists act by decreasing CFTR-mediated ion transport and are being developed for the treatment of polycystic kidney disease and cholera-induced secretory diarrhea. [0014] There are many (>1500) different gene mutations for CF. Mutations affecting the CFTR gene cause a large variety of defects including altered CFTR channel gating (class III mutations such as G551D and G1349D) or impaired CFTR protein maturation (class II mutations such as F508del). Therefore, compounds increasing CFTR-dependent chloride transport are potentially useful as drugs to treat CF patients. In particular, pharmacological activators of CFTR, called potentiators, are useful to overcome the gating defect caused by class III CF mutations. Conversely, other compounds, called correctors, may help the F508del-CFTR protein to escape the endoplasmic reticulum and reach the plasma membrane. Potentiators are also useful for F508del. Indeed, this mutation causes also a gating defect, although less severe than that of classical class III mutations. On the other hand, CFTR inhibitors are characterized by decreased CFTR activity. [0015] The most common mutation, F508del-CFTR (class II), results from a 3 base pair deletion that leads to the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the full-length protein. The resulting F508del-CFTR protein is unstable and susceptible to rapid degradation in the 26S proteosome, with little if any F508del-CFTR at the plasma membrane. In the lungs of CF patients, the lack of transport of chloride and accompanying water across the airway epithelium and excessive sodium reabsorption leads to dehydrated airway surface fluid, impaired mucociliary clearance, infection and inflammation. Increasing the amount of F508-CFTR that reaches the plasma membrane, or otherwise improving its function, offers the potential to improve the hydration of the airway surface fluid and reverse part of the underlying pathophysiology. [0016] The compounds of the present invention may provide a novel therapeutic strategy in cystic fibrosis (CF). [0017] B. Novel Compounds [0018] 1.

A pharmaceutically acceptable salt can include, but is not limited to, acid addition salts including hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulphates, hydrogen sulphates, alkylsulphonates, arylsulphonates, arylalkylsulfonates, acetates, benzoates, citrates, maleates, fumarates, succinates, lactates, and tartrates; alkali metal cations such as Li, Na, and K, alkali earth metal salts such as Mg or Ca, or organic amine salts. [0091] A "pharmaceutical composition" is a formulation comprising the disclosed compounds or a combination thereof in a form suitable for administration to a subject. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is preferably formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral and parenteral, e.g. , intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, inhalation, topical, transdermal, transmucosal, and rectal administration. [0092] The term "substituted, " as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i. e. , =0), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g. , C=C, C=N, or N=N). [0093] Substituents for the groups referred to as alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkylene, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl can be selected from a variety of groups including -ORd', =0, =NRd', =N-ORd', -NRd'Rd", -SRd', -halo, - SiRd'Rd"Rd" ', -OC(0)Rd', -C(0)Rd', -C02Rd', -CONRd'Rd", -OC(0)NRd'Rd", - NRd"C(0)Rd', -NRd"'C(0)NRd'Rd", -NRd"'S02NRd'Rd", -NRd"C02Rd', -NHC(NH2)=NH, -NRa'C(NH2)=NH, -NHC(NH2)=NRd' , -S(0)Rd', -S02Rd', -S02NRd'Rd", -NRd"S02Rd', - CN, and -N02, in a number ranging from zero to three, with those groups having zero, one or two substituents being exemplary.

When Rd' and Rd" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5- , 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NRd'Rd" can represent 1-pyrrolidinyl or 4- morpholinyl. [0095] Typically, an alkyl or heteroalkyl group will have from zero to three substituents, with those groups having two or fewer substituents being exemplary of the present invention. An alkyl or heteroalkyl radical can be unsubstituted or monosubstituted. In some embodiments, an alkyl or heteroalkyl radical will be unsubstituted. [0096] Exemplary substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals include, but are not limited to -ORd', =0, =NRd', =N-ORd', -NRd'Rd", -SRd', -halo, -SiRd'Rd"Rd"', - OC(0)Rd', -C(0)Rd', -C02Rd', -CONRd'Rd", -OC(0)NRd'Rd", -NRd"C(0)Rd', - NRd"'C(0)NRd'Rd", -NRd ' "S 02NRd ' Rd " , -NRd"C02Rd', -NHC(NH2)=NH, - NRa'C(NH2)=NH, -NHC(NH2)=NRd' , -S(0)Rd', -S02Rd', -S02NRd'Rd", -NRd"S02Rd', - CN, and -N02, where Rd', Rd", and Rd"' are as defined above.

Typically, an aryl or heteroaryl group will have from zero to three substituents, with those groups having two or fewer substituents being exemplary in the present invention. In one embodiment of the invention, an aryl or heteroaryl group will be unsubstituted or monosubstituted. In another embodiment, an aryl or heteroaryl group will be unsubstituted. [0099] Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of an aryl or heteroaryl ring in an aryl or heteroaryl group as described herein may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(0)-(CH2)q-U-, wherein T and U are independently -NH-, -0-, -CH2- or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 2. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -J-(CH2)r-K-, wherein J and K are independently -CH2-, -0-, -NH-, -S-, -S(O)-, - S(0)2-, -S(0)2NR '-, or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 3. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -(CH2)s-X-(CH2)r, where s and t are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X is -0-, -NRf'-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(0)2-, or - S(0)2NRa'-. The substituent Rf' in -NRf'- and -S(0)2NRf'- is selected from hydrogen or unsubstituted (CrC6) alkyl. [00100] As used herein, a "secondary active agent" is selected from a mucolytic agent, a bronchodialator, an antibiotic, an anti-infective agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, a CFTR modulator, a nutritional agent, or any agent known to treat CF. [00101] "Stable compound" and "stable structure" are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. [00102] As used herein the term "therapeutically effective amount" generally means the amount necessary to ameliorate at least one symptom of a disorder to be prevented, reduced, or treated as described herein. The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" as it relates to the compounds of the present invention shall mean dosage that provides the specific pharmacological response for which the compound is administered in a significant number of subjects in need of such treatment. It is emphasized that a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that is administered to a particular subject in a particular instance will not always be effective in treating the conditions/diseases described herein, even though such dosage is deemed to be a therapeutically effective amount by those of skill in the art. [00103] The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" as it relates to the secondary active agent of the present invention shall mean the dosage that provides the specific pharmacological response for which the secondary active agent is administered in a significant number of subjects in need of such treatment. [00104] The term "biological sample" includes, but is not limited to, samples of blood (e.g. , serum, plasma, or whole blood), urine, saliva, sweat, breast milk, vaginal secretions, semen, hair follicles, skin, teeth, bones, nails, or other secretions, body fluids, tissues, or cells. [00105] D. Pharmaceutical Compositions [00106] The invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of the invention described herein and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable carriers are described in "Remington: The Science and Practice, Twentieth Edition," published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, which is incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may also comprise one or more non-inventive compound active agents. [00107] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can comprise novel compounds described herein, the pharmaceutical compositions can comprise known compounds which previously were not known to have CFTR modulatory activity, or a combination thereof. [00108] The compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired secondary active agents or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (secondary agents or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired agents and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. The therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, a compound of the present invention may be administered concurrently with a secondary agent used to treat the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (such as control adverse effects). [00109] In one embodiment the secondary active agent is selected from a mucolytic agent, a bronchodialator, an antibiotic, an anti-infective agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, a CFTR modulator, a nutritional agent, or any agent known to treat CF. [00110] In one embodiment the secondary active agent is a GSNOR inhibitor. [00111] In one embodiment, the secondary active agent is a GSNOR inhibitor disclosed in WO2010/019903, U.S. Pat. No. 8,470,857, U.S. Pat. No.8,642,628, WO2010/019910, and U.S. Pat. No.8,586,624. [00112] In another embodiment, the secondary active agent is a GSNOR inhibitor disclosed in WO2011/100433, U.S. Pat. No.US 8,481,590, WO2012/048181, WO2012/083165, WO2012/083171, and WO 2012/170371. [00113] In another embodiment, the secondary active agent is selected from gentamicin, curcumin, cyclophosphamide, 4-phenylbutyrate, miglustat, felodipine, nimodipine, Philoxin B, genistein, Apigenin, cAMP/cGMP modulators such as rolipram, sildenafil, milrinone, tadalafil, aminone, isoproterenol, albuterol, and almeterol, deoxyspergualin, HSP 90 inhibitors, HSP 70 inhibitors, proteosome inhibitors such as epoxomicin, lactacystin, terfenadine, enalapril, meclofenamic acid, carbaryl, suprofen, urosolic acid, zaprinast, benzo[c]quinolizinium derivatives that exhibit CFTR modulation activity, modulators of abc transporters, benzopyran derivatives that exhibit CFTR modulation activity, etc. [00114] The compounds of the invention can be utilized in any pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form, including, but not limited to injectable dosage forms, liquid dispersions, gels, aerosols, ointments, creams, lyophilized formulations, dry powders, tablets, capsules, controlled release formulations, fast melt formulations, delayed release formulations, extended release formulations, pulsatile release formulations, mixed immediate release and controlled release formulations, etc. Specifically, the compounds of the invention described herein can be formulated: (a) for administration selected from the group consisting of oral, pulmonary, intravenous, intra-arterial, intrathecal, intra-articular, rectal, ophthalmic, colonic, parenteral, intracisternal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, local, buccal, nasal, and topical administration; (b) into a dosage form selected from the group consisting of liquid dispersions, gels, aerosols, ointments, creams, tablets, sachets, and capsules; (c) into a dosage form selected from the group consisting of lyophilized formulations, dry powders, fast melt formulations, controlled release formulations, delayed release formulations, extended release formulations, pulsatile release formulations, and mixed immediate release and controlled release formulations; or (d) any combination thereof. [00115] For respiratory infections or pulmonary exacerbations of CF, an inhalation formulation can be used to achieve high local concentrations. Formulations suitable for inhalation include dry power or aerosolized or vaporized solutions, dispersions, or suspensions capable of being dispensed by an inhaler or nebulizer into the endobronchial or nasal cavity of infected patients to treat upper and lower respiratory bacterial infections. [00116] Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can comprise one or more of the following components: (1) a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvents; (2) antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; (3) antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; (4) chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; (5) buffers such as acetates, citrates, or phosphates; and (5) agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. A parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes, or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. [00117] Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use may comprise sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.), or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. The pharmaceutical composition should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. [00118] The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion, and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol or sorbitol, and inorganic salts such as sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. [00119] Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active reagent in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating at least one compound of the invention into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and any other required ingredients. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, exemplary methods of preparation include vacuum drying and freeze-drying, both of which yield a powder of a compound of the invention plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. [00120] Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed, for example, in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the compound of the invention can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. [00121] For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser that contains a suitable propellant, e.g. , a gas such as carbon dioxide, a nebulized liquid, or a dry powder from a suitable device. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active reagents are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The reagents can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g. , with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. [00122] In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are prepared with carriers that will protect against rapid elimination from the body. For example, a controlled release formulation can be used, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. [00123] Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. [00124] Additionally, suspensions of the compounds of the invention may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate, triglycerides, or liposomes. Non-lipid polycationic amino polymers may also be used for delivery. Optionally, the suspension may also include suitable stabilizers or agents to increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. [00125] It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of the compound of the invention calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the compound of the invention and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active agent for the treatment of individuals. [00126] Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention comprising at least one compound of the invention can comprise one or more pharmaceutical excipients. Examples of such excipients include, but are not limited to binding agents, filling agents, lubricating agents, suspending agents, sweeteners, flavoring agents, preservatives, buffers, wetting agents, disintegrants, effervescent agents, and other excipients. Such excipients are known in the art.

[00127] The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions that are useful in treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in a patient by administering to said patient an effective amount of a compound of the present invention alone or in combination with one or more secondary active agents (e.g. GSNOR inhibitor). [00128] In one embodiment, the secondary active agent is a GSNOR inhibitor disclosed in WO2010/019903, U.S. Pat. No. 8,470,857, U.S. Pat. No.8,642,628, WO2010/019910, and U.S. Pat. No.8,586,624. [00129] In another embodiment, the secondary active agent is a GSNOR inhibitor disclosed in WO2011/100433, U.S. Pat. No.US 8,481,590, WO2012/048181, WO2012/083165, WO2012/083171, and WO 2012/170371.

Methods of Preparing Compounds of the Invention [00135] The compounds of the invention can readily be synthesized using known synthetic methodologies or via a modification of known synthetic methodologies. As would be readily recognized by a skilled artisan, the methodologies described below allow the synthesis of substituted bicyclic aromatic compoundss having a variety of substituents. Exemplary synthetic methods are described in the Examples section below. [00136] If needed, further purification and separation of enantiomers and diastereomers can be achieved by routine procedures known in the art. Thus, for example, the separation of enantiomers of a compound can be achieved by the use of chiral HPLC and related chromatographic techniques. Diastereomers can be similarly separated. In some instances, however, diastereomers can simply be separated physically, such as, for example, by controlled precipitation or crystallization. [00137] The process of the invention, when carried out as prescribed herein, can be conveniently performed at temperatures that are routinely accessible in the art. In one embodiment, the process is performed at a temperature in the range of about 25Â°C to about 110Â°C. In another embodiment, the temperature is in the range of about 40Â°C to about 100Â°C. In yet another embodiment, the temperature is in the range of about 50Â°C to about 95Â°C. [00138] Synthetic steps that require a base are carried out using any convenient organic or inorganic base. Typically, the base is not nucleophilic. Thus, in one embodiment, the base is selected from carbonates, phosphates, hydroxides, alkoxides, salts of disilazanes, and tertiary amines. [00139] The process of the invention, when performed as described herein, can be substantially complete after several minutes to after several hours depending upon the nature and quantity of reactants and reaction temperature. The determination of when the reaction is substantially complete can be conveniently evaluated by ordinary techniques known in the art such as, for example, HPLC, LCMS, TLC, and 1H NMR. [00140] G.

The particular combination of therapies (secondary agents or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired agents and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. The therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, a compound of the present invention may be administered concurrently with a secondary agent used to treat the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (such as control adverse effects). [00145] The patient can be any animal, domestic, livestock, or wild, including, but not limited to cats, dogs, horses, pigs, and cattle, and preferably human patients. As used herein, the terms patient and subject may be used interchangeably. [00146] As used herein, "treating" describes the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating a disease, condition, or disorder and includes the administration of a compound of the present invention to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications, alleviating the symptoms or complications, or eliminating the disease, condition, or disorder. More specifically, "treating" includes reversing, attenuating, alleviating, minimizing, suppressing, or halting at least one deleterious symptom or effect of a disease (disorder) state, disease progression, disease causative agent (e.g. , bacteria or viruses), or other abnormal condition. Treatment is continued as long as symptoms and/or pathology ameliorate. [00147] In general, the dosage, i.e. , the therapeutically effective amount, ranges from 1 Î¼g/kg to 10 g/kg and often ranges from 10 Î¼g/kg to 1 g/kg or 10 Î¼g/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight of the subject being treated, per day. [00148] G. Uses [00149] In subjects with cystic fibrosis, modulation may be achieved, for example, by administering one or more of the disclosed compounds that up regulates CFTR function. These compounds may be administered alone or in combination with other agents as described in detail herein. [00150] The present invention provides a method of treating a subject afflicted with a disorder ameliorated by CFTR modulation. Such a method comprises administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention alone or in combination with a secondary active agent. [00151] The disorders can include pulmonary disorders associated with CFTR modulation in the lungs and airways and/or lung infection and/or lung inflammation and/or lung injury (e.g. , pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, asthma, pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis/interstitial lung diseases, cystic fibrosis, COPD, primary ciliary dyskinesia, chronic bronchitis, respiratory tract infections); cardiovascular disease and heart disease (e.g., hypertension, ischemic coronary syndromes, atherosclerosis, heart failure, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary artery dilation); diseases characterized by angiogenesis (e.g., coronary artery disease); neurological disorders; pancreatic diseases (e.g., pancreatitis, diabetes), inflammatory diseases (e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, colitis, arthritis and psoriasis); functional gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)); disorders of ocular fluid balance (e.g. keratoconjunctivitis sicca, recurrent corneal erosions, corneal edema, glaucoma, retinal detachment and retinal ischemia); disorders of the salivary gland (e.g. , xerostomia, salivary gland hypofunction); reproductive disorders (e.g., infertility, amenorrhea); bone disorders (e.g. , osteoporosis); proliferative cell disorders (e.g. , lung carcinoma); disorders where there is risk of thrombosis occurring; disorders where there is risk of restenosis occurring; diseases where there is risk of apoptosis occurring (e.g., heart failure, atherosclerosis, degenerative neurologic disorders, arthritis, and liver injury); and treatment of psoriasis. [00152] In one embodiment, the disorder is cystic fibrosis. Compounds of the invention are capable of treating and/or slowing the progression of cystic fibrosis. For approximately 90% of patients with CF, death results from progressive respiratory failure associated with impaired mucus clearance and excessive overgrowth of bacteria and fungi in the airways (Gibson et al., 2003, Proesmans et al., 2008). Compounds of the invention may positively modulate CFTR. Compounds of the invention are capable of treating and/or slowing the progression of CF. In this embodiment, appropriate amounts of compounds of the present invention are an amount sufficient to treat and/or slow the progression of CF and can be determined without undue experimentation by preclinical and/or clinical trials. [00153] The therapeutically effective amount for the treatment of a subject afflicted with a CFTR mediated disorder. For example, for asthma, a therapeutically effective amount is a bronchodilating effective amount; for cystic fibrosis, a therapeutically effective amount is an airway obstruction ameliorating effective amount or an amount effective in lessening the symptoms in the pancreas, GI tract, and/or liver caused by CF; for ARDS, a therapeutically effective amount is a hypoxemia ameliorating effective amount; for heart disease, a therapeutically effective amount is an angina relieving or angiogenesis inducing effective amount; for hypertension, a therapeutically effective amount is a blood pressure reducing effective amount; for ischemic coronary disorders, a therapeutic amount is a blood flow increasing effective amount; for atherosclerosis, a therapeutically effective amount is an endothelial dysfunction reversing effective amount; for glaucoma, a therapeutic amount is an ocular fluid balancing amount; for diseases characterized by angiogenesis, a therapeutically effective amount is an angiogenesis inhibiting effective amount; for disorders where there is risk of thrombosis occurring, a therapeutically effective amount is a thrombosis preventing effective amount; for disorders where there is risk of restenosis occurring, a therapeutically effective amount is a restenosis inhibiting effective amount; for chronic inflammatory diseases, a therapeutically effective amount is an inflammation reducing effective amount; and for disorders where there is risk of apoptosis occurring, a therapeutically effective amount is an apoptosis preventing effective amount.

[00292] Example 3: HTS of Compounds to Identify CFTR Modulators [00293] The identification of novel pharmacological modulators (potentiators, correctors, and inhibitors) of the CFTR chloride channel was achieved by performing high- throughput screening using a functional assay (Sui, J. et al, Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2010 Dec; 8(6):656-68). [00294] YFP is a derivative of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Its fluorescence is quenched in the presence of chloride at high concentrations. Its sensitivity to anions has been further improved by mutagenesis. For CFTR, a convenient fluorescent probe is the halide- sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (HS-YFP). The different sensitivity of the HS-YFP toward iodide and chloride allows one to perform assays measuring the transport of anions through the plasma membrane as changes in cell fluorescence. For this assay, the cells expressing HS-YFP are equilibrated in a physiological chloride-rich saline solution (e.g., Dulbecco's PBS). During fluorescence reading, cells are exposed to a high concentration of iodide. Iodide influx quenches the cell fluorescence with a rate that depends on the halide permeability of cell membrane, and therefore, on the activity of anion channels or transporters. [00295] Correctors: This protocol is designed to selectively screen compound for F508del-CFTR correctors on a HTS assay platform. Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells stably expressing YFP and F508del-CFTR and CFBE 41o- cells (CFBE) transiently transfected with YFP and F508del-CFTR were used for high throughput screening. Cells were incubated for 24-hrs in the presence of test compounds. The cells were washed to remove excess compound, stimulated with 20 Î¼Î forskolin and 3 Î¼Î of potentiator P3 in DPBS for 1-2 h, and the YFP signal quenching rate by iodide influx was then measured. The rate of fluorescence quenching is proportionally related to the total CFTR activities in the cell membrane. F508del-CFTR correctors accelerate YFP quenching by increasing the number of CFTR molecules in the plasma membrane. Dose response curves and EC50 for each compound were obtained by fitting the data to the Hill's equation (Jinliang Sui and et al, Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2010 Dec; 8(6):656-68). [00296] Potentiators: This protocol is designed to selectively screen compound for F508del CFTR potentiators on a HTS assay platform. Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells stably expressing YFP and F508del-CFTR were incubated overnight at 27 Â°C to induce maturation of F508del-CFTR. Cells were then washed with PBS buffer, treated for one to two hours at room temperature with Forskolin (20 Î¼Î) plus varying concentrations of GSNOR inhibitor. Potentiator activity was measured as YFP quenching rate by iodide influx. Iodide enters the cells via active CFTR channels in the plasma membrane, and quenches the YFP fluorescence. The rate of fluorescence quenching is proportionally related to the total CFTR activities in the cell membranes. F508del-CFTR potentiator accelerates YFP quenching by increasing overall CFTR activities in the plasma membrane. [00297] Results: In the Corrector assay with the CFBE 41o- cells (CFBE) transiently transfected with YFP, compounds 1-3, 5-11, 14, 17, 19-23, 26, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 39-44, 47, and 49-52 of Example 1 had an EC50 of < 100 nM.

[00298] Example 4: Ussing chamber measurements of CFTR activity in AF508 HAE cell monolayers treated with compounds of the present invention [00299] Human Airway Epithelial (HAE) cells are grown at an air/liquid interface to obtain short-circuit current measurements in Ussing chambers. Cells are thawed from liquid nitrogen storage, washed and plated as passage 1 onto 100 mm cell culture plates for expansion in BEGM culture medium (Randell, et al. Primary Epithelial Cell Models for Cystic Fibrosis Research. Methods Mol Biol 2011; 742 : 285-310). At 80-90% confluency, cells are trypsinized, washed, suspended in ALI medium (Randell, et al.), and counted twice for accuracy. The total number of cells seeded as passage 2 in ALI medium onto each collagen-coated Snapwell (Corning 3407) porous membrane insert should be between 150K and 250K, as per standard protocol. [00300] HAE cells are maintained at 37 Â°C, 95% 02 in ALI medium at a liquid/liquid interface until a confluent monolayer is formed, generally 5-8 days after seeding. HAE cultures are then maintained at an air/liquid interface in ALI medium (2.5 mL basolateral) changed every 48 hours). The apical surfaces of the cultures are washed with PBS every other day or as needed to remove mucus accumulation. Cells are maintained under these conditions for no less than 21 days to obtain well-differentiated HAE cultures before compounds are added and subsequent short-circuit current experiments are performed. [00301] Treatment with Compounds [00302] HAE cells are washed apically with PBS 18-24 hours prior to addition of compounds. Stock dilutions of compounds are made in sterile IX PBS (PBS concentration never exceeded 0.1%). Snapwells are treated in the basolateral compartment with 2.5 mL ALI containing the test compound at the final concentration. To initiate treatment, one 20 uL drop of basolateral medium containing compound is placed on the apical surface of the cultures. Cultures are treated for a total of 24 hours before Ussing chamber experiments are performed. [00303] Ussing Chamber Experiments Update conditions [00304] Experiments are performed in a modified Ussing chamber with LabChart Software. Chamber temperature is maintained at 37 C +/-1 C by a circulating water bath, and agar bridges are equilibrated in 5 mL bilateral Krebs-bicarbonate-Ringer buffer solution (KBR; 140 niM Na+, 120 niM CI", 5.2 niM K+, 1.2 niM Ca2+' 1.2 niM Mg2+' 2.4 niM HP042_' 0.4 mM U2Po4 , 25 mM HC03", and 5 mM glucose) (Fulcher et al., Novel Human Bronchial Epithelial Cell Lines for Cystic Fibrosis Research. AJP - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology 2009; 296 : L82-L91.) for 20 minutes prior to the start of the experiment. Pulse measurements are taken every 20 seconds and recorded digitally. Chambers are zeroed with blank Snapwell inserts. Reference potential difference (PD, mV) and short circuit current (Isc, Î¼Î/cm ) measurements of cells are made prior to data acquisition. Basal PD and Isc is measured in bilateral KBR solution for approximately 10 minutes, or until a steady KBR/KBR baseline is obtained. KBR is then aspirated from the apical chamber, and replaced with 5 mL of a modified KBR buffer, high K+, low CI" solution (HKLC; 40 mM Na+, 100 mM K+, 4.5 mM CI", 120 mM gluconate, 25 mM HC03", 2.4 mM HP042_ 0.4 mM HP04", 1.1 mM Ca2+' 1.2 mM Mg2+' and 5.2 mM glucose) (at 37 Â°C). Newly modified baseline PD and Isc measurements are obtained and allowed to stabilize for approximately 10 minutes. Ion channel agonists and inhibitors are added to Ussing chambers at 10 minute intervals or longer depending on the stability or trend of the Isc. The following is a typical planned protocol for all chambers regardless of pretreatment condition: Amiloride 100 Î¼Î apical; Forskolin 10 Î¼Î bilateral; Genistein 10 uM apical; CFTRinhl72 10 Î¼Î apical; UTP 100 Î¼Î apical. [00305] Example 5: [00306] Intestinal current measurements (ICM) study of compounds of the present invention" in mice colon sections to detect CFTR function [00307] Following euthanasia, the murine large intestine (or colon) is removed by fine dissection, taking care to cut but not pull the intestine from its mesenteric attachment. Before mounting in the Ussing chamber, the murine intestine is prepared by seromusculature "stripping" to minimize the influence of the intrinsic neuromuscular system. Seromusculature stripping removes the serosa (visceral peritoneum) and the longitudinal/circular muscle layers of the intestinal wall, leaving the underlying mucosal elements, primarily the epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosae. During harvest and dissection, the intestinal section is kept inRPMI 1640 medium containing 2.5 mM NaHC03 and 10 Î¼Î indomethacin. Indomethacin reduces contribution of non-CFTR mediated CI- channels. The tissue is then mounted into a tissue holder (slider), placed in the Us sing chambers with RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.5 mM NaHC03 and 10 Î¼Î indomethacin added bilaterally with continuous aeration with 95 02:5 C02. Voltage and current are monitored under open and closed circuit conditions, respectively, to measure transepithelial resistance (RT). The short circuit current (Isc) is then monitored under voltage clamp conditions. Measurements are performed under conditions of fluid resistance compensation, i..e, readings are monitored following 'blanking' for fluid resistance in a tissue holder without tissue present.Following stabilization of currentthe tissue is treated with amiloride (100 Î¼Î, mucosal exposure) to block Na+ absorption. The tissue is then stimulated with 10 Î¼Î forskolin + 100 Î¼Î IBMX (bilateral exposure) to raise intracellular cAMP. Tissues are then stimulated with carbachol (100 Î¼Î, serosal exposure) to activate basolateral K+ channels and augment CFTR- dependent CI" secretion. In the presence of functional CFTR at the mucosal cell membrane these agonists generate an upward defection of the Isc mediated by serosal to mucosal CI" secretion. In the absence of CFTR, a small K+ current is stimulated that produces a downward deflection in the Isc. Following current stabilization, bumetanide (100 Î¼Î) is added to the serosal compartment to block the Na+/K+/2C1" co-transporter. In the presence of CFTR, bumetanide generates a downward deflection in the Isc, reflecting inhibition of CFTR- dependent CI" transport. In the absence of CFTR, bumetanide results in an upward deflection of the Isc, due to inhibition of the K+ secretion. Thus, these maneuvers effectively isolate CFTR activity, producing either a large CFTR-dependent CI" secretory current or a smaller (reverse polarity) K+ current. Moreover, the addition of bumetanide results in the Isc also moving in opposing directions dependent on the presence or absence of CFTR at the mucosal membrane. [00308] Example 6: Western Blot [00309] The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ion transport protein which, in its active form, resides in the plasma membrane. CFTR consists of two homologous halves which both contain six transmembrane domains (TM) and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD), and these two halves are covalently connected by a regulatory domain (R). This complex, multidomain structure undergoes inefficient posttranslational folding, and folding is further exacerbated by the presence of point mutations such as F508del-CFTR. As much as 50-80% of newly synthesized wildtype CFTR does not achieve a proper folding state and is eventually degraded as core-glycosylated folding intermediates following retrograde translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The remaining core-glycosylated CFTR (immature; band B; -150 kDa) attains a folded conformation which is competent to be exported via vesicle transport from the ER to the Golgi complex. CFTR is further modified in the Golgi to achieve a complex-glycosylated form (mature; band C; -180-200 kDa) which is ultimately transported to the plasma membrane. Trafficking efficiency of CFTR can be monitored by immunoblotting, since the mature "band C" form of CFTR can be distinguished from the immature "band B" form by their migration pattern on SDS polyacrylamide gel analysis (SDS-PAGE). The proportion of mature CFTR versus total CFTR can be used as a measure of trafficking efficiency. In the case of wild- type CFTR, the majority of detectable protein is found as the complex glycosylated "C-band" form with a lesser amount migrating as the immature "B-band." For F508del-CFTR, very little translated protein properly advances through the protein folding and processing pathways within the cell. When analyzed by immunoblot the majority of F508del-CFTR protein is found in the B-band and little to none is detected at the slower migration of the C-band. If cells or tissues containing the F508del-CFTR mutant protein are treated with a "corrector" compound, then a shift in the amount of protein from the B-band to the C-band will be observed by immunoblot. [00310] Method for performing immunoblotting to analyze the relative amounts of CFTR C-band and B-band: If using cells, add an appropriate number of cells to a tissue culture plate and grow in a cell-type appropriate growth media at the desired experimental temperature (generally 37 Â°C). Cells should generally be subconfluent and actively growing at initiation of the experiment. Cells are treated with a CFTR modulator or a control compound for a set amount of time, depending on the experiment. When the treatment with test compound is completed, cells are washed with an appropriate ice-cold buffer, and scraped into the desired amount of ice-cold buffer. Cells are harvested by centrifugation and can be lysed as described below for immediate analysis or stored as a cell pellet at -70Â°C for later use. [00311] If analyzing tissues from an animal model experiment, the animals are treated with a CFTR modulator or an appropriate control, according to the model system being used. The tissues are eventually harvested and stored at -70Â°C until ready to use. [00312] Proteins from the cell or tissue samples are analyzed using SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) followed by immunoblotting. Resuspend the cells or tissue in a cell lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Lysis is accomplished by detergent extraction and/or vortexing, homogenizing, or other mechanical disruption while maintaining the samples at 4Â°C. Clarify the lysates by centrifugation at approximately 25,000 g for 10 min at 4Â°C. Determine the supernatant protein concentration using standard methods, for example, the BCA (bicinconinic acid) protein assay. Prepare an appropriate amount of protein sample (e.g. 10-20 Î¼g per lane) for SDS-PAGE using a standard sample buffer (e.g. Laemmli sample buffer) and heat samples to 70Â°C for 10 min. Load a fixed amount of sample onto an SDS-PAGE gel system, such as the NuPAGEÂ® 3-8% Tris-Acetate Minigels or NovexÂ® 6% Tris-Gycine Minigels and electrophorese using the appropriate running buffering solution, voltage, and time that is compatible with the type of gel being used and time required to separate the proteins according to their molecular size. [00313] After electrophoresis, the proteins are transferred to membranes (e.g. PVDF or nitrocellulose) for using a wet or semi-dry apparatus designed for immunoblotting and an appropriate transfer buffer. The membranes with transferred proteins bands are then blocked in a suitable blocking buffer such as Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) and 5% non-fat milk or another protein blocking agent . An antibody specific for CFTR is then added to the solution and incubated with the membrane for the desired length of time. After incubation with the anti-CFTR antibodies, the membrane is thoroughly washed with buffer. Following the wash, the membrane is incubated with a secondary detection antibody, which binds to the anti-CFTR antibody, and contains a conjugate such that the antibody complex can produce a signal that can be detected, for example a chemiluminescent signal. The relative amounts of CFTR C-band and B-band can then be visualized and analyzed. * * * * [00314] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the methods and compositions of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. 1.
