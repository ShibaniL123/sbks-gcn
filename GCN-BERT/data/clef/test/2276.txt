CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to Chinese patent application no. 201410135569.9， filed April 4， 2014， titled “Bio-marker for cancer therapy” ， the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to methods for determining the responsiveness of a subject to treatment with a MEK or ERK inhibitor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade (MEK/ERK pathway) is one of key pro-proliferation and pro-survival pathways. Mutations in the MEK/ERK pathway have been found to lead to uncontrolled growth in many cancers (e.g.， melanoma) . Compounds that inhibit steps in the MEP/ERK pathway have been used to treat cancer. However， some patients that harbor mutations in MEK/ERK pathway show resistance to MEK or ERK inhibitors. There is a need for an effective means of determining which patients having mutations in MEK/ERK pathway will resist to treatment of MEK or ERK inhibitors and for incorporating such determination into effective treatment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In one aspect， the present disclosure provides a method for predicting the responsiveness of a cancer cell to an MEK inhibitor. In certain embodiments， the method comprises detecting the presence of at least one mutation in one or more genes selected from the group consisting of ADAM12， COL14A1， TNN， and TP53， in the cancer cell， by contacting a nucleic acid sample derived from the cancer cell with at least one oligonucleotide which allows specific detection of the mutation； wherein presence of mutation in ADAM 12， COL 14A 1， TNN， TP53 and/or any combination thereof is indicative of decreased responsiveness of the cancer cell to the ERK inhibitor. The mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) -extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) cascade， also known as Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway， is one of the key signaling pathways involved in tumor oncogenic growth and progression. The signal pathway starts when a signaling molecule (e.g.， a growth factor) binds to the receptor on the cell surface. This triggers Ras (a GTPase) to sap its GDP for a GTP. The GTP-bound Ras then activate Raf， which activates MEK， which activates ERK. ERK then activates some proteins， such as myc， that control cell division and cell survival. When one or more proteins in the pathway， such as Ras， are mutated， it can lead to the signaling pathway stuck in the activated status， which is a necessary step in the development of many cancers. As a result， inhibitors of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway have been developed to treat cancer. Certain patients have been found resistant to MEK or ERK inhibitors. The mechanisms underlying resistance to these inhibitors are unclear. Multiple MEK and ERK1/2 inhibitors are currently under clinical investigation for cancer treatment and more agents targeting MEK or ERK1/2 are under preclinical development. Examples of MEK inhibitors include without limitation Trametinib (GSK1120212) ， Selumetinib， Binimetinib (MEK162) ， PD-325901， Cobimetinib (GDC-0973， XL518) ， and CI-1040 (PD035901) . ERK inhibitors include without limitation SCH772984， FR180204， GDC-0994. In certain embodiments， the MEK inhibitor is Trametinib. Trametinib (trade name Mekinist) has chemical name N- (3- {3-Cyclopropyl-5- [ (2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl) amino] -6，8-dimethyl-2， 4， 7-trioxo-3， 4， 6， 7-tetrahydropyrido [4， 3-d] pyrimidin-l (2H) -yl} phenyl) acetamide. The structure of Trametinib is illustrated below. As used herein， the term “responsiveness” refers to the likeliness of a cell/individual/patient/subject responding to the treatment of MEK or ERK inhibitor， i.e. showing decreased proliferation/growth and/or increased cell death after being treated with a MEK or ERK inhibitor. In certain embodiments， the responsiveness can be scaled as insensitive (i.e.， less likely to respond) ， sensitive (likely to respond) and uncertain. In certain embodiments， the cell/individual/patient/subject is less likely to respond to a treatment of MEK or ER inhibitor when the cell/individual/patient/subject shows a decreased likeliness that a pathological complete response (pcR) ， i.e. absence of invasive cancer， will occur. In certain embodiments， the deceased likeliness means about 70％， 60％， 50％， 40％， 30％， 20％， 10％ likeliness of the pcR occurred in a reference patient (e.g.， a patient without mutation in the gene of interest) . In certain embodiments， responsiveness of a cell can be evaluated by measuring IC50 of the cell to a MEK or ERK inhibitor. As used herein， the term “mutation” refers to the deviation of a genomic DNA from a normal reference (e.g.， wild-type genomic DNA) ， for example， additions， deletions， insertions， rearrangements， inversions， transitions， transversions， frame-shift mutations， nonsense mutations， missense mutations， translocations， and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Methods of detecting the presence of a mutation in a gene are described herein and known in the art (in general， see e.g.， Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual， 2nd Ed.， ed.By Sambrook， Fritsch and Maniatis， Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press， 1989) . Examples of the method include， without limitation， sequencing of nucleic acids (e.g.， Sanger di-deoxy sequencing， “next generation” sequencing methods and single molecule sequencing) ， PCR (polymerase chain reaction) -based assay (real-time RCR， PCR-RFLP assay (see Cancer Research 59 (1999) ， 5169-5175) ， mass-spectrometric genotyping (e.g. MALDI-TOF) ， HPLC， enzymatic methods and SSPC (single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (see Pathol Int (1996) 46， 801-804) ) ， hybridization-based assay (e.g.， Northern-blot， Southern blot， 5’ -exonuclease (TaqManTM) probe， molecular beacons， fluorescence energy transfer probes， Scorpion probes) . In certain embodiments， the method may include enzymatic amplification of DNA or cDNA fragments of the gene to be evaluated by PCR. The resulting PCR products may be subjected to either conventional Sanger-based dideoxy nucleotide sequencing methods or parallel sequencing methods ( “next generation sequencing” ) such as those marketed by Roche (454 technology) ， Illumina (Solexa technology) ABI (Solid technology) or Invitrogen (IonTorrent) . Mutations may be identified from sequence reads by comparison with publicly available gene sequence databases. Alternatively， mutations may be identified by incorporation of allele-specific probes that can either be detected using enzymatic detection reactions， fluorescence， mass spectrometry or others. In certain embodiments， the method may include amplifying DNA or cDNA fragments of the gene of interest using primers specifically bind to only one of normal and mutated sequence. As a result， amplification product can only be found in one of normal and mutated genes. As such， the presence of the mutation in the gene can be determined by detecting the presence of the amplification product. In certain embodiments， the method may include contacting the nucleic acid sample with an oligonucleotide probe which specifically hybridizes to the mutation of the gene to form a complex. The oligonucleotide probe can be designed as not hybridizing to the normal sequence of the gene. The presence of the hybridization complex can be detected using reporter signals， e.g.， fluorescence. As a result， the presence of the mutation in the gene can be determined by detecting the formation of the complex. In certain embodiments， the mutation is present in an exon of the gene. In certain embodiment， the presence of the mutation leads to the amino acid change of the polypeptide encoded by the gene. Table 3 shows exemplary nucleic acid sequences of the mutations to be determined in accordance to the present invention. As used herein， a specific mutation is annotated as the resulted amino acid change. For example， mutation Q650K refers to a codon/triplet encoding amino acid K at position 650 of the gene， where amino acid G exists in wild type sequence. ADAM12 gene (Gene ID： 8038) encodes a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metaloprotease) protein family. Members of the ADAM family are membrane-anchored proteins structurally related to snake venom disintegrins， and have been found involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. ADAM12 gene has two alternative spliced transcripts： a shorter secreted form and a longer member-bound form. COL14A1 gene (Gene ID： 7373) encodes the alpha chain of type XIV collage， a member of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) collagen family. Type XIV collagen interacts with the fibril surface and is involved in the regulation of fribrillogenesis. TNN gene (Gene ID： 63923) encodes tenascin N precursor. Tenascin is a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins， whose member has been found to in healing woulds and in the stroma of some tumors. TP53 gene (Gene ID： 7157) encodes tumor protein p53， which is a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation， DNA binding， and oligomerization domains. Tumor protein p53 responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes， thereby inducing cell cycle arrest， apoptosis， senescence， DNA repair， or changes in metabolism. Mutations in TP 53 gene have been found to associate with a variety of cancers. Alternative splicing of TP53 gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms. Additional isoforms have also been shown to result from the use of alternate translation initiation codons. As used herein， position number refers to the sequence of tumor protein p53 isoform a. In certain embodiments， the mutation in ADAM 12 is selected from the group consisting of mutation Q650K， R240L， C440Y， Q228E， H247D， M322I， T97fs， P168L and G308E in ADAM12； the mutation in COL14A1 is selected from the group consisting of mutation R178W， L713_splice， Q1272K， L479I， L1295F， E1024K， P1467S， G737R， K1023T， G966C， S 1512fs in COL 14A 1； the mutation in TNN is selected from the group consisting of mutation V353M， Y296S， A733P， D707Y， D471Y， P1010T， S71L， D457Y， P1155L， R476C， Q872H， Q261L， D798Y， C1237*， D67N and T823S in TNN； the mutation in TP53 is selected from the group consisting of mutation Q331R， C135fs， E285K， V274F， Y220C， P250L， R175H， R248Q， R280K， R248L， C176Y， A307_splice， R273L， R158L， A138fs， H193R， A159D， C277F， R248W， Y220C， V274F， R196*， E224_splice，， K164*， M246I， A159V， S241F， C242R， S261_splice， E339*in TP53， wherein “*” means the mutation leads to a stop condon， “fs” means the mutations leads to frame shift， “splice” means the mutation leads to alternative splice of mRNA.

In cases where the patient is identified as a likely non-responder， said patient is recommended not to be treated with a monotherapy of the MEK or ERK inhibitor， or not to be treated with an MEK or ERK inhibitor. In certain embodiments， wherein the patient is identified as a likely non-responder to a MEK inhibitor， the patient is recommended to be treated with a different MEK inhibitor， or to be treated with a combined therapy of a different MEK inhibitor and an additional therapeutic agent of distinct mechanism.

EXAMPLE 1 The following is an example of identifying genes correlated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors and/or ERK inhibitors. We examined the anti-proliferation activity of a MEK inhibitor， trametinib， and an ERK1/2 inhibitor， SCH772984， in a panel of 50 cell lines (see Table 1) . Table 1. Cell lines used in the screen Materials and Methods Cell Culture All the cells will be cultured in the media supplemented with 10％ FBS except for which are marked specially， in the temperature of 37℃， 5％ CO2 and 95％ humidity. Cell Viability Reagent Cell viability is assayed by usingLuminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit (Cat. No. ： G7572， Promega. Store at -20℃) . To prepare the CellTiter_Glo Reagent， the CellTiter-Glo Buffer was thawed and equilibrated to room temperature prior to use. For convenience the CellTiter-Glo Buffer may be thawed and stored at room temperature for up to 48 hours prior to use. The lyophilized CellTiter-Glo Substrate is equilibrated to room temperature prior to use. The appropriate volume (100ml) of CellTiter-Glo Buffer is transferred into the amber bottle containing CellTiter-Glo Substrate to reconstitute the lyophilized enzyme/substrate mixture， which forms the CellTiter-Glo Reagent. In certain cases， the entire liquid volume of the CellTiter-Glo Buffer bottle may be added to the CellTiter-Glo Substrate vial. Mix by gently vortexing， swirling or by inverting the contents to obtain a homogeneous solution. The CellTiter-Glo Substrate should go into solution easily in less than one minute. MEK and ERK Inhibitor MEK inhibitor Trametinib was purchased from Selleckchem (Cat No. S2673) and stored at -20 ℃ before use. ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 was purchased from Selleckchem (Cat No. S7101) and stored at -20 ℃ before use.

Cytotoxicity and IC50 determination The day before the experiment (Day -1) ， cells were dissociated during the logarithmic growth period with Cell Disassociation Buffer (Gibco 13151-014) and mixed with appropriate cell media and centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 3 minutes. The cells were re-suspended and counted using Countstar before adjusting cell concentrations to optimized density (i.e. 4.44× 104 cells/ml) with respective culture medium listed in Table 1 for 3-day CTG assay (The cell density was optimized before actual study； cell density used in the test may vary for different cell lines) . 90μl cell suspensions were added to two 96-well plates (plates A and B) with the final cell density of 4× 103 cells/well for 3-day CTG assay (the cell density was optimized before actual study； cell density used in the test may vary for different cell lines) . The plate A and B group were incubated for overnight in humidified incubator at 37 ℃ with 5％ CO2. On Day 0， for plate A group， 10μl culture medium was added to each well for T0 reading. Reagent was added at equal volume of cell culture medium present in each well (e.g.， add 100μl of reagent to 100μl of medium containing cells for a 96-well plate) . Contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to facilitate cell lysis. The plate was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize luminescent signal. Backseal black sticker was added to the bottom of each plate. Luminescence was recorded using EnVision Multi Label Reader. This formed the basis for T0 value. On Day 0， the test articles and positive controls were dissolved at the concentration indicated at Test Article Dilution map. 100× solution in PBS was prepared and then diluted with appropriate culture media (1∶ 10) into 10×working solutions. 10μl (10×) drug solutions were dispensed in each well (triplicate for each drug concentration) of the plate B group according to plate inoculation map. The test plates were incubated for 4 days in the humidified incubator at 37° with 5％CO2. On Day3， Reagent was added at equal volume of cell culture medium present in each well (e.g.， add 100μl of reagent to 100μl of medium containing cells for a 96 -well plate) . Contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis. The plate was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize luminescent signal. Backseal black sticker was placed to the bottom of each plate. Luminescence was recorded using EnVision Multi Label Reader. The data were displayed graphically using GraphPad Prism 5.0. In order to calculate IC50s， a dose-response curve was fitted using a nonlinear regression model with a sigmoidal dose response. The formula for calculating surviving rate was shown below； Absolute IC50 is calculated where Y axis set at 50％ using GraphPad Prism 5.0. Software. The surviving rate (％) ＝ (LumTest article-LumMedium control) / (LumNone treated-LumMedium control) × 100％. LumNone treated-LumMedium control is set as 100％ and LumMedium control is set for 0％ surviving rate. T0 value was presented as percentage of LumNone treated. Statistical analysis We divided the 63 cell lines into sensitive， insensitive， and uncertain groups according to their IC50′s for SCH772984 and Trametinib， respectively， then detected genes with differential expression or different mutation types between sensitive and insensitive groups. These genes were enriched in several cancer related pathways. The 63 cell lines were divided into 3 groups (See Table 1) ： a sensitive group (IC50 values were less than 1) ， an insensitive group (IC50 values are greater than 10) ， and an uncertain group (the rest) . Accordingly， we got 25 sensitive and 22 insensitive cell lines for SCH772984， and 34 sensitive and 24 insensitive cell lines for Trametinib. Only cell lines with genomic data were used in subsequent analysis. The differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways were analysed using GSEA software， the genes with different mutation types were detected using Fisher′s exact test.
