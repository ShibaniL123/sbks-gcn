Step 1: 2,4,6-Trichloronicotinaldehyde
2,4,6-Trichloropyridine (5 g, 27.4 mmol) in anhydrous THF (100 ml) was cooled to −78° C. A solution of n-butyllithium (22.27 ml, 28.8 mmol) (1.6M in hexane) was added slowly at −78° C. The solution was stirred at −78° C. for 30 mins, then treated with a solution of ethyl formate (10.15 g, 137 mmol) maintaining an internal temperature below −74° C. The resulting solution was stirred at −78° C. until all starting material was consumed (monitored by TLC, 9:1 heptane/EtOAC), then it was quenched at −78° C. with a solution of saturated ammonium chloride and 50 ml 0.5N aq. HCl under vigorous stirring. It was then allowed to warm to r.t. The quenched mixture was extracted with EtOAc, the organic phase was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. The crude residue (light yellow solid) was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel with 0-20% EtOAc/heptane to provide 5.1 g (88% yield) of the desired 2,4,6-trichloronicotinaldehyde as a white solid.
