Step 2: 1-oxoisoindoline-5-sulfonamide
1-Oxoisoindoline-5-sulfonyl chloride (463 mg, 2 mmol) was added to 20 mL acetonitrile. Concentrated ammonia (1 mL, 12 mmol) was added dropwise, and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction solution was neutralized with 6N hydrochloric acid until the pH was neutral. After acetonitrile was removed via spin-evaporation, the residue was filtrated after the addition of water, and the filtrate cake was washed with water and ethyl acetate, and dried to give the product 1-oxoisoindoline-5-sulfonamide (288 mg).Yield: 68%.
