The present embodiments are detailed below with reference to the listed Figures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS Before explaining the present method in detail, it is to be understood that the method is not limited to the particular embodiments and that it can be practiced or carried out in various ways. The present embodiments relate to a method to create and/or build a dynamic compression garment, such as an active compression sleeve, which is designed to aid circulation of the lower legs by contracting and actively squeezing fluid from the legs back to the thoracic cavity. The compression can be achieved with the use of shape memory alloy (SMA). The shape memory alloy can be woven into fabric which forms a flexible sleeve that, upon application of current, will compress in a cyclical fashion. This compression propagates up the leg as a wave to encourage fluid flow. There are two products that are available to consumers on the market currently. The first is a static compression sock and the second is an active sleeve that uses single compartment air bags to compress large areas of the leg simultaneously. The static compression socks are good for mobility and can be worn underneath normal clothing, but do not aid in circulation—they only limit swelling. The second active sleeve requires larger air compression machines, such as those found in hospitals, which aid in circulation, but due to their size and cost, they are not mobile or practical for use in everyday situations. The method creates a compression sleeve that is unique due to its use of a smart material to achieve artificial pumping that propagates up the leg more closely resembling natural circulation via the constriction of veins. With the use of monitoring systems the active compression sleeve can also be programed to compress at different rates and time determined by the user's heart rate. Another important advantage of the device created by the method is the warming up of the shape memory alloy wire through use as heat and pressure are used in conjunction with one another to encourage blood flow. People who would benefit from this include patients with peripheral edema, congestive heart failure, bedridden patients with stagnated fluid flow, patients who suffer from abnormal blood pressure, compartment syndrome, restless leg syndrome, pregnant women, obese patients with poor circulation, people with stationary lifestyles, travelers who spend long periods of time being sedentary, diabetic patients, elderly patients, patients with varicose veins, and/or any other person suffering from peripheral edema, cramps, or poor circulation. Note that this compression garment formed by the method is not limited to the lower limbs, but can be used in any area suffering from cramps, swelling, or similar problems on any part of the body. The garment and/or sleeve can also be designed to encourage fluid flow to extremities in situations where this would be helpful, specifically after surgery where blood flow may be required to the treated area and those already noted above. Other applications of this technology include massage and muscle relief, sports medicine, and relief from cramps. Smaller bands could provide a more targeted effect for any problem area. In embodiments, the compression garment made by the method can be in the form of a compression sleeve that can fit over the leg or another body part as needed. The shape memory alloy (SMA) wire ca be incorporated into the fabric (woven, glued, fused are just a few examples) of the compression sleeve in such a way that a change in the lattice structure of the shape memory alloy (SMA) (which occurs through heating) will cause compression of the sleeve. The incorporation of the shape memory alloy (SMA) wire into the fabric can create a mechanical load that allows distinct compression and relaxation of the compression sleeve. The different wires in the fabric will function independently of each other in order to have a propagating wave. This can be controlled through a control unit, such as a microcontroller. The shape memory alloy (SMA) requires a certain temperature (as determined by the manufacturing processes) above that of the human body. Examples of shape memory alloy (SMA) can be FLEXINOL™. FLEXINOL™ requires a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius in order to change its lattice structure and thus compress. Heat treating and cold working the shape memory alloy wire can result in the two distinct lattice structures. To shape the wire initially it must be heated above 70 degrees Celsius to establish its primary shape. When the shape memory alloy wire is then cooled to below the lattice changing temperature, the shape memory alloy (SMA) can be reshaped. Thus when the wire is heated up past the lattice changing temperature, it will revert to its heat treated shape. The temperature that is required to change lattice structure varies. However there are other shape memory alloy formulas that can also be used. The shape memory alloy wire can be insulated from the human body and the current through the wire will be limited by various fuses. Additionally a quick release mechanism can be incorporated to disconnect power to the compression sleeve and remove the sleeve quickly. The embodiments can include a temperature sensor that can automatically shut off the system if the temperature of the patents skin rises above a specified benchmark. This temperature increase is achieved through an electrical process such as running current through the shape memory alloy wire (via wall outlet or battery pack) or by some other heating element. This heat, along with the electricity, can be insulated from the patient through multiple fail-safes in order to ensure safety. The contraction of the compression sleeve will take place in a progressive manner either up or down the leg (or other body part) as needed. This progressive compression and subsequent relaxation can take place in a cyclical manner, the frequency of which can be variable. This technology can also be used in conjunction with other monitoring systems, such as heart rate monitors, pulse oximeters, or similar devices. The method creates a compression garment with the ability to provide progressive compression up or down a limb, which allows it to aid in circulation more effectively than a currently available compression sleeve. In addition, the compression sleeve would be smaller, lighter, sans various wires, and mobile. It is also something that can be worn under clothing while at work, on an airplane, after physical activity or in almost any other situation, which makes it more versatile and adaptable than any existing technologies. The frequency of compression, direction of progressive compression, positioning, and other features are also variable and thus the sleeve can be customized for a number of different uses and settings. The method creates a product utilizes the best of current high-end technologies and incorporates them into a system that is practical for everyday situations. Its increased mobility and versatility also make it more accessible and helpful in the situations where problems arise, as opposed to patients having to return home or to a particular facility in order to obtain treatment. With the use of monitoring systems, the active compression sleeve can also be programed to compress at different rates and time determined by the user's heart rate. Another important advantage is the warming up of the shape memory alloy wire through use as heat and pressure are used in conjunction with one another to encourage blood flow. Parties that can use the compression garment and/or compression sleeve made by the method can include biomedical companies, particularly those that deal in hemostatic imbalances and/or material science, as well as athletic companies, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, and individuals, such as those with peripheral edema or sore legs or other conditions aided by this sleeve. Sequence of Assembly: The compression sleeve can be assembled using a fabric that has specific pressure break away points, such as 30 mmHg. The attachment between the fabric and the shape memory alloy is done in such a way that there is a strong mechanical connection. An example of this attachment can be by using a screw with washers to attach the shape memory alloy and the fabric together. In embodiments, several different ways to can be used to attach the shape memory alloy and the fabric together, such as a riveted method that uses a molded plastic piece. The shape memory alloy can be controlled with a microcontroller which has an infinite variability in how the shape memory alloy is activated. The activation can be done with direct current or with a pulse width modulation to vary the speed at which the shape memory alloy contracts. Sequence of Use: The patient using the compression garment can be fitted or use a standard size depending on the issue that is being addressed. The amount of compression can be controlled by several methods including but not limited to a pressure sensor embedded inside of the sleeve or a patch of fabric acting as a breakaway that can prevent over compression. The compression rating can be designated by the doctor or by standards that are set. The user can then be able to use the sleeve during everyday activity having power either being provided by a power supply, such as a battery pack or by using a constant wall source of power. A benefit of the compression garment made by the method is that the compression garment can be worn and the patient or subject can be ambulatory that is the patient can walk around, even run around wearing the apparatus on their body. There is no need for a user to sit still to use the compression device. A benefit of the compression garment made by the method is that it can save lives by providing a low-cost, practical medical device for hospital or home use, such as to help treat deep vein thrombosis. A benefit of the compression garment made by the method is that it can save lives and can reduce human suffering by providing a way to move and massage arms and legs to help prevent bedsores for patients confined to long-term bed-rest: paralysis patients, coma patients, and the extreme elderly. A benefit of the compression garment made by the method is that it can help elderly people by providing warm direct mechanical massage to improve blood flow and retain elasticity of tissues of the arms, legs, hands, feet, and joints. A benefit of the compression garment made by the method is that it can help children by providing a device for warm gentle massage for children with blood circulation problems.

Each segmented flex frame can be adapted to contract the spring links at least 1 percent to 10 percent in width to the contracted shape when the shape memory alloy contracts, and each segmented flex frame can be configured to expand the spring links from the contracted shape to the expanded shape when the shape memory alloy relaxes. The method can include installing the shape memory alloy on alternating components of the segmented flex frame, such as over all the spring links forming an X-shaped pattern, a sinusoidal pattern, a modified X-pattern, a plurality of circles patterns or any pattern usable with the method and application.

The order of the contraction and the expansion changes depending on which type of shape memory alloy is used, that is for some shape memory alloys, when current is applied, it causes the spring link to take on the contracted shape 24, while for different shape memory alloys when current is applied, the current causes the spring link to take on the expanded shape 23. The spring link changes in shape when at least one occurs: (1) current is applied or released on the shape memory alloy and (2) pressure is applied by the tensioner to the shape memory alloy.

The method to form a compression garment for a body part of a human or animal is depicted in this embodiment as steps The method can include forming a segmented flex frame, wherein each segmented flex frame has a first terminal, a second terminal, a plurality of struts, a plurality of spring links, with at least one bridge connecting between each strut and adjoining component, which can be one or more spring links, shown as step 100. The method can include installing a shape memory alloy on the struts of the segmented flex frame over at least one spring link, shown as step 102. The method can include connecting a first end of the shape memory alloy to the first terminal and a second end of the shape memory alloy to the second terminal, wherein the terminals perform a mechanical connection and an electrical connection forming a circuit incorporating the shape memory alloy, shown as step 104. The method can include connecting the segmented flex frame with the shape memory alloy to a flexible backing, shown a step 106. The method can include connecting an attaching means to the flexible backing, wherein the attaching means is used to hold the flexible backing onto the body part, shown as step 108. The method can include installing a fabric cover over a side of the segmented flex frame having the attached shaped memory alloy, shown as step 110. The method can include connecting a controller with a means for timing to the shape memory alloy and to the segmented flex frame, wherein the controller is operatively connected to the first and second terminals, and wherein the controller is configured to apply a current to the shape memory alloy at defined intervals using the means for timing thereby providing compression therapy to the body part with the shape memory alloy, shown as step 112. The method can include installing a tensioner to the flexible backing for applying a baseline pressure to the body part, shown as step 114. The method can include connecting a power supply to the controller, wherein the power supply provides the current to the shape memory alloy, so that in operation the controller executes either an intermittent, sequenced, or continuous compression therapy to the body part, wherein the compression therapy involves creating at least one heating phase causing a length of the shape memory alloy to reach a target transition temperature to either lengthen or shorten the shape memory alloy and forming at least one cooling phase causing the length of the shape memory alloy at the target transition temperature to lengthen or shorten opposite of the length change caused by the at least one heating phase, shown as step 116. The method can include using the controller to provide at least one of: (a) preset levels for current to provide the compression therapy, and (b) current based on preset units of time to create at least one heating phase that raises the temperature of the shape memory alloy to a target transition temperature from 40 degrees Centigrade to 110 degrees Centigrade to shorten or lengthen the length of the shape memory alloy, shown as step 118. The method can include using a sensor connected to the shape memory alloy or using the shape memory alloy itself, to measure at least one physical characteristic of the dynamic compression garment including changes in dimension of the compression garment apparatus, stiffness of the body part, changes in dimension of the body part; measurable physiological parameters of the human and/or animal such as heart rate, and blood pressure, and combinations thereof, shown as step 120. The method can include creating at least one standby phase that maintains the temperature of the shape memory alloy just below the target transition temperature keeping the length of the shape memory alloy unchanged but preparing the shape memory alloy for the shortening or lengthening of the shape memory alloy, shown as step 122. The method can include using the controller and computer instructions in the data storage to compare sensed real time measured garment dimensions to preset garment dimension values and change current delivery to the shape memory alloy to achieve the preset garment dimension values, shown as step 124. An example of preset garment dimension values can be dimensions of the garments non-activated state, such as length of the segmented flex frame when not activated, and length of the segmented flex frame when initially tensioned, and length of the segmented flex frame when the shape memory alloy has initial current applied to the shape memory alloy and lengths when additional amounts of current are applied to the shape memory alloy. The following examples aid in understanding the use of the garment formed according to the method. An elderly person with very limited mobility and dementia is no longer able to take care of themselves. They require daily manipulation by a caregiver while they are in bed, to prevent bedsores and to maintain their tissues as well as possible. The garment would be placed by a caregiver onto an arm or leg to provide massage during their manual therapy. One additional benefit of the method of building or making the compression garment apparatus is for diabetic patients because a very large percentage of advanced diabetics have peripheral neuropathy. Human feet have barely adequate blood flow, so they tend to heal less quickly that other parts of the body. As a result they are unable to feel sores developing on their feet and may easily develop foot ulcers, which then do not heal very well. Many diabetics loose one or both feet to diabetic ulcers, and sometimes they lose their life. This invention will enable diabetic people to treat their feet to daily massages to improve blood flow to both prevent and to help treat diabetic foot ulcers.
