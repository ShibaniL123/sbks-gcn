Intermediate 38: 5-Iodo-2-isopropyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a solution of 2-isopropyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (Intermediate 27, 100 mg, 0.44 mmol) in THF (2.9 mL) at −78° C. was added n-butyllithium (1.6 M in hexanes; 0.33 mL, 0.52 mmol) dropwise via syringe. After stirring at −78° C. for 30 min, a solution of 1,2-diiodoethane (148 mg, 0.524 mmol) in THF (0.75 mL) was added, and stirring maintained for 10 min at −78° C. The reaction was then warmed to rt for an additional 30 min before being quenched with sat. aq. NH4Cl. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2), and the combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (127 mg, 82%).
