To a round-bottom flask under argon atmosphere was added 3-4 (1.5 g, 9.3 mmol, 1 equiv) and suspended in dichloromethane (90 mL). Added di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (4.1 g, 18.6 mmol, 2 equiv), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.114 mg, 0.93 mmol, 0.1 equiv) and diisopropylethylamine (3.3 mL, 18.6 mmol, 2 equiv). After addition of reagents, a reflux condenser under argon atmosphere was affixed and reaction flask was heated at 60Â° C. for 6 hours. Upon returning to room temperature, reaction was quenched with deionized water (20 mL) and neutralized with 1M hydrochloric acid. Organics were washed with a saturated solution of aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl), separated, and dried with magnesium sulfate. After filtering through a coarse frit, the filtrate was reconcentrated and purified by flash chromatography using an isocratic method of 20% ethyl acetate and 80% hexanes, yielding intermediate 3-5 (1.87 g, 7.16 mmol, 77% yield). Product was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR in CDCl3.
