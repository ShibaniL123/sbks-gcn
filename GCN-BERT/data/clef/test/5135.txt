The present invention relates to a process for purifying the compound anastrozole, such as to a pharmaceutically acceptable grade of purity. Background of the Invention Anastrozole, chemically (2,2'-[5-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl) -1,3-phenylene]di(2-methylpropionitrile) of the formula (1) is a pharmaceutically active agent acting as a selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase is an enzyme which regulates the level of certain female sex hormones, such as estrogens. In pharmaceutical applications, anastrozole is used for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women. In the pharmaceutical compositions it is used in the form of the free base. The whole class of 1,3-substituted aralkyl heterocyclic compounds, among which the anastrozole compound was a specific example, as well as acid addition salts of these compounds such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate and toluene-p-sulfonate (these salts having not been exemplified in case of anastrozole), have been disclosed in US 4935437 (reissued as US RE 36617) and the EPB 296749. There are various processes known for the synthesis of the anastrozole. The most important of them use the 1,2,4-triazole as it is a cheap and useful reagent. In the original document, US 4935437, the anastrozole compound itself was actually prepared by two such procedures. The first procedure (see Example 1 of EPB 296749) comprises, in the last steps, a reaction of the methyl compound of the formula (2) with N-bromosuccinimide to yield the bromomethyl- compound of the formula (3), which was treated with sodium 1,2,4-triazole to give the crude anastrozole. Crude anastrozole was purified by column chromatography (details not given) and crystallization from cyclohexane/ethyl acetate got a purified material with a melting point of 81-82Â°C. Neither the yield nor the purity is mentioned in the process description. In a later document WO 2005-105762, it is reported that this process was repeated with a poor yield (<50%) and poor quality (<90% by HPLC). In particular, the crystallization procedure was not successful in reducing the level of the isomeric impurity - the isoanastrozole of the formula (4), which was still contained in a level of more than 1.0% by HPLC. In a second procedure disclosed in the EPB'749 (Example 8), the last steps use the hydroxymethyl- compound of formula (5), which was converted into a chloromethyl-compound of formula (6). The crude compound (6) (obtained by evaporation of the ethyl acetate extract of the reaction mixture) was reacted with 1,2,4-triazole for 18 hours at the reflux in acetonitrile to yield a mixture of anastrozole and the isoanastrozole of the formula (4). This mixture was separated by column chromatography using methanol-chloroform mixture as the eluent. Also, the yield and the purity of the anastrozole product was not mentioned. The need to use chromatographic separation makes these processes economically unattractive for industrial scale. One way to avoid this problem is to use a different synthetic scheme; one that does not produce the isoanastrozole compound and/or produces impurities that are easy to remove. Some regioselective schemes are known; see for example EPB '749 example 69 and WO 2006-000836, which essentially avoid the production of isoanstrozole. But these schemes have disadvantages including the use of expensive and/or toxic reagents and conditions or the requirement of extra synthetic steps. Improving the 1,2,4-triazole process would thus be desirable. Two later documents were published dealing with attempts to improve the above 1,2,4-triazole-employing process, and in particular with attempts to provide a pharmaceutical grade anastrozole (which is a compound having at least 99.7% purity with max. 0.1 % of any single impurity) without the need of a chromatographic purification of the crude anastrozole. WO 2005-105762 indicates that the known process provides a product with 3-5% of the isoanastrozole impurity (4) when performing the process on an industrial scale. The level of the impurity may be reduced by using dimethyl formamide ("DMF"), advantageously in combination with a non-polar solvent in the coupling reaction. But, the isoanastrozole impurity cannot be removed to <0.1 % level by any crystallization technique, even after a repeated crystallization. However, such impurity may be reduced to the <0.1 % level by crystallizing an anastrozole salt. After the purification, the required base of anastrozole is obtained by neutralization of the salt. The overall process of WO 2005-105762 can be summarized as follows: reacting the bromo-compound (3) with sodium or potassium 1,2,4-triazole in DMF with or without a non-polar solvent;quenching the reaction mixture with water medium and extracting crude anastrozole with an organic solvent;distilling the organic solvent and treating the rest with organic or mineral acid to form the acid addition salt of anastrozole;recrystallizing the acid addition salt from an organic solvent;neutralization of the salt with a base to obtain anastrozole; andcrystallizing the anastrozole from an organic solvent to get a product of pharmaceutically acceptable grade. US 2006-0035950 reports a similar process for the purification of crude anastrozole. The process employs the bromide intermediate (3) as a starting material and has the following characteristics: the intermediate (3) is preferably purified before its use in the synthesis by crystallization or precipitation;the coupling of (3) with the sodium 1,2,4-triazole or with the 1,2,4-triazole under basic conditions yielding crude anastrozole is performed in a solvent of the Class 3 or Class 2 (as defined in the Industrial guideline of residual solvents published by the International Conference of Harmonization); andthe crude anastrozole is purified via an isolated anastrozole salt form involving crystallization, acidic extraction, or both. The isolated salt form of anastrozole, e.g., as the hydrochloride or hydrobromide salt, is crystallized from an organic solvent or mixtures of the organic solvents (similarly as in WO 2005-105762). The purified salt is then converted back to the desired anastrozole base by neutralization. In the examples, the neutralization is achieved by adding an aqueous solution of an inorganic base (sodium carbonate) and the liberated anastrozole base is extracted into an organic solvent (e.g. toluene) and crystallized therefrom. Although this crystallization removes most of the impurities, particularly hydrophobic impurities, the published application reports that the isoanastrozole impurity is not sufficiently reduced. In fact, various solvents employed for the crystallization of the anastrozole hydrochloride provided a product having from 1.1 to 8.1 % of isoanastrozole. To overcome this, the published application proposes selectively extracting impurities, especially the isoanastrozole, via an acidic solution. Specifically, a crude anastrozole (base) in an organic solvent is mixed with an aqueous acid solution having a pH between 0.7 to 1.7, whereby the isoanastrozole is selectively removed into the aqueous phase leaving most of the desired anastrozole in the organic phase (however a part of the anastrozole is also removed into the aqueous phase as the reported yield of the single extraction is max. 82%). Upon phase separation and removal of the aqueous phase, the anastrozole-containing organic phase has less isoanastrozole. The extraction may be performed multiple times in order to reach a desired level of isoanastrozole. Contrary to the first process, this process does not efficiently remove hydrophobic impurities. Therefore, both processes may be advantageously combined: the anastrozole is purified by extraction, then it is converted into the salt, the salt is isolated (whereby it is purified from hydrophobic impurities) and then converted back to the anastrozole base. However, it appears from the examples that multiple acidic extractions are needed in order to adequately reduce the level of isoanastrozole. In summary, it can be quite difficult to remove impurities from crude anastrozole sufficiently to obtain a pharmaceutically acceptable quality grade. It would be desirable to have an alternative purification process. In particular, a reliable process that can be shorter/simpler and especially cheaper/more efficient would be advantageous. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for the purification of anastrozole which comprises combining anastrozole base with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution to form a solution and crystallizing anastrozole base from the solution. Although an acid is present, an anastrozole acid addition salt is not precipitated. As explained more fully hereinafter, it is believed that the acid forms a salt with anastrozole allowing for better water solubility, but due to hydrolytic instability and the severe water insolubility of the base, the free base of anastrozole can precipitate instead of the anastrozole salt unless a large excess of acid is present. Accordingly the acid solution is generally a dilute acid, usually having an acid concentration of 5% or less, frequently 1-2%. The use of an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution as, or as part of, the aqueous-based solvent system allows for significant purity increases in the anastrozole crystallization, especially with respect to the isoanastrozole impurity. The aqueous acid solution can further contain a water miscible C1-C4 aliphatic alcohol such as methanol and/or a dipolar aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide. Generally the amount of alcohol present in an aqueous acid solution is no greater than 80% and typically is present within a range of 20-80%, and in some embodiments 40-60%. The dipolar aprotic solvent, when present, is typically an artifact of the synthesis of anastrozole; i.e., it is the solvent in the crude reaction mixture from which anastrozole is desired to be crystallized. When not isolating anastrozole from a crude reaction mixture, the aqueous based solvent system typically contains water, the acid and optionally, the alcohol. An additional aspect of the invention relates to a process for purifying anastrozole, which comprises: (a) recrystallizing anastrozole base from an aqueous-based solvent system that comprises water, hydrochloric acid, optionally a water miscible C1-C4 aliphatic alcohol, and optionally a dipolar aprotic solvent; and/or(b) recrystallizing anastrozole base from an aqueous-based solvent system that comprises water and a water miscible C1-C4 aliphatic alcohol, but does not contain hydrochloric acid. The recrystallization steps can be performed in any order and each can be performed multiple times; e.g. performing steps (a), (a), (b), (a) and (b). However, typically such a large number of recrystallization steps are not needed to obtain a desired pharmaceutical purity level. The use of both an acid-containing aqueous-based solvent system and a non-acid containing aqueous based solvent system to carry out the recrystallizations of anastrozole can provide an efficient complementary purification effect. A further aspect of the invention relates to a process for making a pharmaceutical grade anastrozole comprising the steps of: a) providing anastrozole in a reaction mixture by the condensation of the chloromethyl- compound of the formula (6) or bromomethyl- compound of formula (3) with sodium 1,2,4-triazole in a water miscible dipolar aprotic solvent;b) adding water and hydrochloric acid to the anastrozole-containing reaction mixture and precipitating crude anastrozole base therefrom;c) dissolving said crude anastrozole base in a mixture of water and a water miscible C1-C4 aliphatic alcohol in the presence of max. 1.5 molar equivalents of HCl and crystallizing anastrozole base to form purified anastrozole; andd) recrystallizing one or more times the purified anastrozole from a mixture of water and water miscible C1-C4 aliphatic alcohol to form anastrozole base in a purity of at least 99.97% and less than 0.1% of isoanastrozole. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention can purify anastrozole without the need to convert crude anastrozole into an isolated anastrozole acid addition salt and/or to employ extraction steps in a process of purification of the crude anastrozole resulting from the synthetic process employing the 1,2,4-triazole and a halomethyl-reaction partner. Instead, one of two simple crystallization processes may be employed, alone or in combination, whereby any of them allows to decrease not only the content of the isoanastrozole impurity of formula (4) but also other impurities arisen from the synthesis. As a result, a pharmaceutical grade anastrozole, i.e. anastrozole having the content of the title compound of at least 99.7% and the content of any single structurally related impurity of less than 0.1%, may be obtained in a simple and reliable process on an industrial scale. The first crystallization process of the present invention is based on the finding that acid addition salts of anastrozole are very sensitive towards aqueous hydrolysis. Dissolving or suspending an anastrozole salt, e.g. anastrozole hydrochloride, in an aqueous environment results in forming the solid anastrozole base without a need of any neutralization agent. This is most probably because anastrozole base itself is a very week base (so that the equilibrium content of the non-protonated anastrozole in the acidic environment is relatively high) and, moreover, the anastrozole base is extremely insoluble in water. Thus, the hydrolytic equilibrium is dramatically shifted towards the formation of anastrozole base, which, as an insoluble product, precipitates from the aqueous environment and further shifts the equilibrium towards its formation. Apparently the salt can only be stabilized in the presence of sufficient excess (generally more than 2 molar equivalents) of the corresponding acid in the aqueous environment. Some salts may be isolated, e.g. crystallized, from such a system depending on the solubility and concentration of the salt and if the excess amount of the acid is sufficiently high. The above finding has an important implication in that the anastrozole base cannot be converted into the equivalent amount of the anastrozole salt when placed into an aqueous environment comprising dilute acid, and, due to its limited solubility, it preferably remains in such system in the undissolved state and as a base. Accordingly, even though the solution may contain anastrozole salt (e.g. ionic anastrozole), anastrozole can be crystallized from the dilute aqueous acidic solutions as the base and not as the corresponding salt as one would expect. Surprisingly, the crystallization of anastrozole under these conditions is accompanied with a substantive purification effect superior to the known purification techniques. More than 75% of the original isoanastrozole present may be removed within a single crystallization. In particular, the amount of the acid in the diluted acidic solution is usually from 0.1 to 2 molar equivalents, more typically 0.1 to 1.5 molar equivalents, in respect to anastrozole. In terms of concentration, the acid is normally less than 5%, preferably less than 2% (e.g. 1% - 2%) based on the amount of water present in the solvent system. The preferred acid is hydrochloric acid. In addition to water, the aqueous acidic solution of anastrozole may also contain an aliphatic water miscible C1-C4 alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol. Generally such an alcohol is not present in amounts greater than 80%, and more typically 20% - 80%, preferably 40%-60%. In the acid-containing embodiments of the solvent system that further comprise the anastrozole reaction solvent, the alcohol is typically used in amounts less than 30% such as 1% - 20%, typically 5% to 10% based on the total volume of the solvent system. For clarity, water in the acid-containing solvent systems typically comprises, for practical reasons, at least 20% of the solvent system and more typically at least 30% and preferably 40% - 100%. Generally the water accounts for 20% - 80%, typically 40% - 60%, with the remainder being the alcohol and/or water miscible reaction solvent such as DMF or DMA. Contrary to the teaching in the prior art (that no crystallization process may be effective for the purpose of the purification of anastrozole base), this crystallization solvent system provides an efficient decrease in both the amount of the isoanastrozole and the other structurally related impurities. This crystallization procedure has a slightly lower purification effect in respect to the isoanastrozole than that disclosed above, however, it is more efficient in removing the other structurally related impurities. Both of the crystallization procedures can be performed by a classical crystallization technique(s), e.g., by heating the mixture up to the dissolution and cooling it under precipitation of the solid. To improve the crystallization, it is useful to inoculate the mixture by a seeding crystal of anastrozole during cooling, and it is also useful to dilute the mixture with water after the precipitation has started to enhance the yield. In particular, by using the above inventive processes in an efficient combination, the invention allows to provide pharmaceutical grade anastrozole. A particularly preferred arrangement in combination with anastrozole synthesis is described below. The first step of the process provides the anastrozole-comprising reaction mixture. The reaction mixture comprising the anastrozole molecule is provided according to any known principle, but preferably by the condensation of the bromomethyl-compound of the formula (3) or the chloromethyl-compound of the formula (6) with 1,2,4-triazole. These starting materials are either commercially available or may be made according to processes known in the art. Preferably, the starting compounds are charged in a purified state. While the purification of the bromo-compound (3) has been sufficiently disclosed in the prior art, there is no method known for the purification of the chloro-compound (6). It has been found, however, that the compound (6) may be efficiently purified by a crystallization from an alcoholic solvent, e.g. from isopropanol, without a danger of the reaction of the reactive chlorine in the compound (6) with the solvent. The 1,2,4-triazole is advantageously charged as its sodium or potassium salt, or together with an alkali metal- or an alkali earth metal containing base (such as potassium carbonate or sodium methoxide). In a particular aspect, which is important in relation to the further isolation process, the reaction is performed in a water miscible solvent, preferably in a water miscible dipolar aprotic solvent, and most preferably in dimethyl formamide or dimethyl acetamide. Thus, the organic co-solvents recommended by WO 2005-105762 are preferably not necessary, which makes the process simpler and ecologically friendlier. As known in the art, the anastrozole-forming condensation of 1,2,4-triazole with the halomethyl reaction partner is accompanied with a side reaction yielding the positional isomer of anastrozole, i.e., the isoanastrozole of formula (4). In addition, other impurities may be formed and/or remainder of the starting materials may be present due to the incompleteness of the conversion. In general, about 5-10 % of the isoanastrozole is usually formed in the reaction mixture before starting any process of isolation and purification. The original reaction mixture may also comprise up to 10% or more of the structurally related impurities arising from the synthesis in this and/or preceded synthetic steps. In the second step of this process, the crude anastrozole base is precipitated from the reaction mixture by using a dilute aqueous acid. The reaction mixture of the first step is diluted by water (using advantageously 1-2 volumes in respect to the volume of the original mixture) and optionally filtered, such as with an activated carbon. As no immiscible organic solvents are employed, a clear solution comprising anastrozole is obtained. The anastrozole-comprising solution is then treated with aqueous hydrochloric acid, preferably at a temperature from 35Â° to 65Â°C. The amount of the hydrochloric acid is selected such that it typically comprises from 0.1 to 2 molar equivalents of HCl and the concentration of HCl is less than 5%, preferably less than 2% of the total mass of the water. Then the solution (e.g. the aqueous-based solvent system containing anastrozole and/or its ion) is cooled to a temperature not exceeding 25Â°C. In accordance with the invented feature, anastrozole does not remain in the solution under these conditions as the dissolved anastrozole hydrochloride, but precipitates as the anastrozole base. To facilitate the crystallization, it is advantageous to seed the reaction mixture by a small amount of crystals of anastrozole base. Furthermore it is useful to dilute the reaction mixture by adding additional water after the precipitation has started (frequently an approx. equal volume as was the original volume of the mixture), to increase the yield and improve the purification effect. The precipitate is isolated by filtration by conventional means and optionally washed and dried to yield crude anastrozole base. The crude product comprises in general around 2% of the isoanastrozole impurity, or about 20% of its original content in the reaction mixture. In the third step, the crude anastrozole base is purified by crystallization from a solution comprising dilute aqueous acid. In an advantageous mode, the crude anastrozole base is suspended in a mixture of water and a water-miscible C1-C4 aliphatic alcohol, which is, e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and/or mixtures thereof. The presence of the alcohols improves the purification effect and increases the solubility, thus decreasing the overall volume of the crystallization mixture. To this mixture, aqueous hydrochloric acid is added and the mixture is heated until dissolution. The concentration of the alcohol is typically from 20-80 vol % of the water-alcohol mixture, more preferably from 40 to 60 vol%. The alcohol is typically methanol. The amount of the acid preferably does not exceed 2 molar equivalents, typically not more than 1.5 molar equivalents, in respect to anastrozole. The temperature of heating is from 40Â° to 60Â°C. The solution is then subjected to crystallization by cooling it to a temperature of less than 25Â°C. The crystallization is preferably facilitated by seeding the mixture during cooling by adding a small amount of crystals of anastrozole base. Furthermore, the crystallization mixture may be also subsequently diluted by water (e.g., by an approx. equal volume as was the original volume of the mixture). The precipitate is isolated by filtration by conventional means and optionally washed and dried to yield purified anastrozole base. The purified anastrozole generally comprises less than 0.5 % of isoanastrozole impurity. If this limit is not reached, it is advantageous to repeat this third step until the limit is reached. In average, no repetition is generally needed. In the fourth step, the purified anastrozole base is crystallized from an alcohol-water mixture. The purified anastrozole base is suspended in a mixture of water and a water-miscible aliphatic alcohol, which is, e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and/or mixtures thereof, and the mixture is heated until dissolution. The concentration of the alcohol is generally from 20-80 vol % of the water-alcohol mixture, and typically from 40 to 60%. The alcohol is generally methanol. The temperature of heating is usually from 40Â° to 60Â°C. If necessary, the warm solution may be filtered with an activated carbon. The solution is then subjected to crystallization by cooling it to a temperature of less than 25Â°C. The crystallization is advantageously facilitated by seeding the mixture during cooling with a small amount of crystals of anastrozole base. Furthermore, the crystallization mixture may be also subsequently diluted by water (e.g., by an approx. equal volume as was the original volume of water or higher). The precipitate is isolated by filtration by conventional means and optionally washed and dried to yield anastrozole base generally of pharmaceutically acceptable grade. If the product does not correspond with the limits for the pharmaceutical grade anastrozole, the fourth step may be repeated. In general, the process of the fourth step is carried out twice. The effectiveness of the process has been seen in several kilogram scale production batches, which can be summarized by the following illustrative data.

In general, the yield of the overall process, calculated on the amount of the starting compound (3), is around 60 to 70%. The purification process does not require any extraction step. It may be easily performed in multi-kilogram scale on single equipment. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.

The invention having been described it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways and all such modifications are contemplated as being within the scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. A process for purifying anastrozole, which comprises crystallizing anastrozole base from an aqueous-based solvent system that contains hydrochloric acid and anastrozole and/or its ion dissolved therein, wherein the amount of the acid is less than 5% based on the amount of water and/or less than 1.5 equivalents of anastrozole.
