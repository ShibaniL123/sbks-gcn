Technical Field The present invention relates to a tissue adhesive and a method for producing the same. Background Art A tissue adhesive means a tissue adhesive to close biological tissues (henceforth referred to as tissues), such as blood vessels and skin, in an operation of cardiovascular surgery, etc. With use of this adhesive, it is possible to prevent blood leaking and such risks so as to improve the safety of the operation. Tissue adhesives include the following three types. The first tissue adhesive is a cyanoacrylate based tissue adhesive, commercial products of which include DERMABOND. This type of tissue adhesive has a problem in that the biocompatibility is low, whereas the bonding strength is high. The second tissue adhesive is a biopolymer-aldehyde based tissue adhesive, commercial products of which include GRF glue. This type of tissue adhesive also has a problem in that the biocompatibility is low, whereas the bonding strength is high. The third tissue adhesive is a fibrin based tissue adhesive, commercial products of which include Bolheal. Conversely, this type of tissue adhesive has a problem in that the bonding strength is low, whereas the biocompatibility is high. In recent years, it has been elucidated that a tissue adhesive including human serum albumin (henceforth referred to as HSA) and a crosslinking agent has high bonding strength (Non Patent Literature 1). HSA is a serum protein made from blood and it is a globular protein having a molecular weight of 69,000 and a diameter of about 10 nm. This is a negatively charged acidic protein. In addition, disuccinimidyl tartarate (henceforth referred to as DST) has been used as the crosslinking agent. However, since any product using a blood is classified into a medicinal product, considerable efforts are required for the approval and clearance. Moreover, once it is approved as a medicinal product, the usage record has to be kept continually for 20 years after the approval. This problematically requires considerable efforts. For this reason, it has been considered to use gelatin, which is a non-blood preparation, instead of HSA. For example, Patent Literature 1 has disclosed a medical material prepared by crosslinking gelatin with succinimidized poly-L-glutamic acid. Moreover, Patent Literature 2 relates to a tissue adhesive film and has disclosed a tissue adhesive film made from gelatin or collagen. However, they have a problem in that the bonding strength is not enough. In addition, Patent Literature 3 relating to a tissue adhesive formulation has disclosed a tissue adhesive formulation which includes a mixture of a synthetic and/or cross-linkable material in a particulate form and a particulate material. However, this tissue adhesive formulation also has a problem in that the bonding strength is not enough. Moreover, there are papers relating to gelatin in which an alkyl group has been introduced on a side chain thereof (Non Patent Literatures 2 and 3). Furthermore, there is a paper including gelatin in which a cholesteryl group has been introduced on a side chain thereof and a tartaric acid crosslinking agent (Non Patent Literature 4). Use of a hydrophobically modified gelatin in which a hydrophobic group has been introduced into a gelatin having a molecular weight of not less than 10000 and less than 50000 instead of HSA may make it possible to provide a tissue adhesive having high bonding strength and high biocompatibility. Bonding properties can be improved if the molecular weight of gelatin is increased. However, there is an instance that, when a porcine-derived gelatin was used, the tissue adhesive did not turn to a liquid state and was hardened into a gel state even if the molecular weight of the gelatin was adjusted to about 20000, and so it failed in uniformly being applied to a bonding part when used as a tissue adhesive, and it was difficult to handle in terms of spreadability. In addition, there is an instance of jelling when it was left at rest at normal temperatures. Moreover, addition of water-insoluble molecules, such as tartaric acid, to a water solvent made it impossible to uniformly disperse these molecules in the water solvent. A tissue adhesive in which such molecules are not dispersed uniformly caused varied bonding properties such as bonding strength and bonding stability. Meanwhile, since a tissue adhesive composed of polyethylene glycol di-succinimidyl succinate (PEG-(SS)2), which is a water-soluble crosslinking agent, and HSA, has been approved in the U.S.A. under the product name ProGEL, it is highly probable that PEG-based polymers can be used well as a constituent of a tissue adhesive.

Summary of Invention Technical Problem An objective of the present invention is to provide a tissue adhesive having high bonding strength, stable bonding properties, and excellent spreadability, and a method for producing the same.

They found out that this tissue adhesive has high bonding strength and can be applied to a tissue uniformly without being heated and is excellent in spreadability because it was not in a gel state but in a liquid state before curing.

The fish-derived gelatin is a fish-derived gelatin derived from tilapia, sea bream, or cod. The molecular weight of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is not less than 50000 and less than 100000. The water-soluble crosslinking reagent includes one type or a combination of two or more types selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol di-succinimidyl succinate, pentaerythritol poly(ethylene glycol) ether tetrasuccinimidyl glutarate, succinimidized poly-L-glutamic acid, an aldehyde group-introduced starch, and an aldehyde group-introduced dextran.

There is included a step of mixing: an adhesive component including an aqueous solution of a fish-derived gelatin, anda curable component including an aqueous solution of a water-soluble crosslinking reagent, wherein the molecular main chain of the water-soluble molecule includes an amide linkage or an ethylene glycol unit or a sugar chain and also has two or more of an active ester group or an acid anhydride or an aldehyde group. Advantageous Effects of Invention The tissue adhesive of the present invention can be prepared by dispersing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and the water-soluble crosslinking reagent uniformly in an aqueous solution and thereby a tissue adhesive having stable bonding properties can be produced. In addition, it is possible to make a tissue adhesive that is not in a gel state but can be in a liquid state and that can be applied to a tissue uniformly and is excellent in spreadability. Covalent bond can be formed by increasing a molecular weight and crosslinking the amino groups of the hydrophobically modified, gelatin molecules with an active ester group or an acid anhydride or an aldehyde group of the crosslinking reagent. Furthermore, bonding strength can be enhanced and the hydrophobically modified, gelatin can be decomposed readily by an enzyme (collagenase) in the course of wound healing and biocompatibility can be enhanced by anchoring the hydrophobic groups into a tissue and thereby forming physically firm bond.

The method for producing a tissue adhesive of the present invention preferably includes the step of mixing the aqueous solution of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin with the aqueous solution of the fish-derived gelatin prepared by dispersing the fish-derived gelatin in the phosphate buffer solution, and by so doing, it is possible to prepare a tissue adhesive by dispersing hydrophobically modified, the fish-derived gelatin and the water-soluble crosslinking reagent uniformly in an aqueous solution and easily prepare a tissue adhesive being high in bonding strength, stable in bonding properties, and excellent in spreadability. In addition, aggregation of hydrophobic groups can be inhibited and the bonding strength of a tissue adhesive can be improved.

Description of Embodiments (Embodiments of the present invention) Hereunder is a description of a tissue adhesive and a method for producing the same, which are the embodiments of the present invention, with reference to the appended drawings. The tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is a tissue adhesive to be applied to a tissue by mixing an adhesive component including an aqueous solution of a fish-derived gelatin with a curable component including an aqueous solution of a water-soluble crosslinking reagent. Especially, it is preferred to use a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin having a hydrophobic group on a side chain thereof as the fish-derived gelatin. In Fig. 1 is illustrated an embodiment having a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and a water-soluble crosslinking reagent. The hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is a macromolecule in which two or more amino acids are connected linearly. A part of the amino groups of Lys contained as the amino acid have been substituted with the aforementioned hydrophobic groups. Lys is one of the protein-constituting Î±-amino acids and it is an essential amino acid. It is an amino acid having an Îµ-amino group on the side chain. A part of the amino groups of Lys can be easily substituted with a hydrophobic group and a part of the amino groups of Lys of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin have been substituted with a hydrophobic group. Preferably, the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin contains, as its main chain, a fish-derived gelatin in which the number of hydroxyproline represented by the following formula (1) per 1000 constitutional amino acids thereof is 90 or less and has an amino group and a hydrophobic group on a side chain thereof. By the use of a fish-derived gelatin skeleton, the adhesive can be readily decomposed by an enzyme and therefore the biocompatibility can be enhanced. Moreover, dispersability in a water solvent can be enhanced. Preferably, the fish-derived gelatin is a gelatin derived from fish of tilapia, sea bream, or cod. This makes it possible to prepare a tissue adhesive by dispersing the fish-derived gelatin uniformly in an aqueous solution and to make a tissue adhesive that is not in a gel state but can be in a liquid state and that can be applied to a tissue uniformly and is excellent in spreadability. The molecular weight of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is preferably not less than 50000 and less than 100000. By adjusting the molecular weight to 50000 or more, bonding strength can be increased. Since the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin contains a fish gelatin as its main skeleton, its dispersability in a water solvent is high and it does not gelate and it can be kept in a liquid form even if its molecular weight is adjusted to 50000 or more. The hydrophobic groups introduced in the fish-derived gelatin anchor to a tissue to fix the fish-derived gelatin firmly to the tissue. By so doing, the hydrophobically modified, gelatin can be physically firmly bonded to a tissue, and thereby bonding strength can be enhanced. Examples of such a hydrophobic group include a cholesteryl group represented by the following formula (2). The hydrophobic groups may include one type or a combination of two or more types of an ethyl group (2 carbon atoms), propyl (3 carbon atoms), a butyl group (4 carbon atoms), a pentyl group (5 carbon atoms), a hexanoyl group (6 carbon atoms), a heptanoyl group (7 carbon atoms), an octanoyl group (8 carbon atoms), a nonanoyl group (9 carbon atoms), a decanoyl group (10 carbon atoms), an undecanoyl group (11 carbon atoms), a dodecanoyl group (12 carbon atoms), a tridecanoyl group (13 carbon atoms), a tetradecanoyl group (14 carbon atoms), a pentadecanoyl group (15 carbon atoms), a hexadecanoyl group (16 carbon atoms), a heptadecanoyl group (17 carbon atoms), a stearoyl group (18 carbon atoms), which are saturated fatty acids; isopropyl (3 carbon atoms), an isobutyl group (4 carbon atoms), an isopentyl group (5 carbon atoms), an isohexanoyl group (6 carbon atoms), an isoheptanoyl group (7 carbon atoms), an isooctanoyl group (8 carbon atoms), an isononanoyl group (9 carbon atoms), an isodecanoyl group (10 carbon atoms), an isoundecanoyl group (11 carbon atoms), an isododecanoyl group (12 carbon atoms), an isotridecanoyl group (13 carbon atoms), an isotetradecanoyl group (14 carbon atoms), an isopentadecanoyl group (15 carbon atoms), an isohexadecanoyl group (16 carbon atoms), an isopalmityl group (16 carbon atoms), an isoheptadecanoyl group (17 carbon atoms), an isostearoyl group (18 carbon atoms), which are branched saturated fatty acids; an oleyl group (18 carbon atoms, one unsaturated carbon atom), a linolenyl group (18 carbon atoms, two unsaturated carbon atoms), an Î±-linolenyl group (18 carbon atoms, three unsaturated carbon atoms), which are unsaturated fatty acids; and a cholesteryl group, which is a cell membrane component. This makes it possible to enhance bonding strength by anchoring hydrophobic groups into a tissue and thereby forming physically firm bond. The water-soluble crosslinking reagent has an amide linkage, an ethylene glycol unit or a sugar chain on the molecule main chain thereof and also has two or more of an active ester group, an acid anhydride, or an aldehyde group. Since the molecule main chain of the water-soluble crosslinking reagent has an amide linkage, an ethylene glycol unit, or a sugar chain, the water-soluble crosslinking reagent exhibits high water solubility, so that an increased dispersability can be exhibited in a water solvent. By having two or more of an active ester group, an acid anhydride, or an aldehyde group in one molecule, the water-soluble crosslinking reagent can react and bond with two amino groups of a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and it can form a firm bond structure by crosslinking two or more fish-derived gelatins. The active ester group is preferably any one type or a combination of two or more types of N-hydroxysuccinimidyl or N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl groups. This is because succinimide is a succinic acid derivative existing in a metabolic pathway in vivo, and has been actually used for an FDA sanctioned tissue adhesive (sealant). The water-soluble crosslinking reagent may include one type or a combination of two or more types selected from the group consisting of 4S-PEG, PEG-(SS)2, succinimidized poly-L-glutamic acid, an aldehyde group-introduced starch, and an aldehyde group-introduced dextran. Examples of the water-soluble crosslinking reagent include pentaerythritol poly(ethylene glycol) ether tetrasuccinimidyl glutarate (abbreviated as 4S-PEG) represented by the following formula (3). Preferably, n is not greater than 60. Preferably, the molecular weight is adjusted to about 10,000. A phosphate buffer solution may be used as the water solvent. The pH value is preferably adjusted to 5 to 9, more preferably 6 to 8. Thereby, it is possible to make a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and a water-soluble crosslinking reagent efficiently undergo a crosslinking reaction via a water solvent when bonding a body tissue. <Bonding of tissue by use of tissue adhesive of this embodiment> Next, a description is made to bonding of tissue by use of the tissue adhesive of this embodiment. First, two pieces of tissue each being approximately rectangular in plan (for example, 1 cm in length, 1 cm in width, and 0.5 cm in height) are prepared. Regarding the tissue, a collagen casing composed of collagen, cellulose, glycerin, and other components can be used as an imitation skin. Then, after applying a liquid adhesive component and a liquid curable component to one surface of one tissue by using a double-syringe injector, these components are mixed on that surface. Next, after pushing the other tissue so that that part coated with the adhesive may be covered, a weight is put on the opposite surface and the set is left at rest under loading weight for a prescribed period of time. The leaving time is necessary for the tissue adhesive to be solidified, and is appropriately set according to the proportion of the constituent materials in the tissue adhesive. Preferably, it is limited to about 10 minutes at most. In this case, it is preferred to heat and perform incubation at a temperature of 37Â°C or less, for example. By so doing, the curing rate can be increased. The set may be left stand at room temperature after the bonding and until it solidifies. Preferably, the tissue adhesive is applied after being pre-incubated at a temperature of 37Â°C or less before use. Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of tissue bonding by use of the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention. An amino group of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin reacts with an active ester group of the crosslinking reagent in a hydrolysis reaction represented by the following formula (4), and thereby an amide linkage is formed. At this time, N-hydroxysuccinimide in the active ester group is separated. In the formula (4), -COOR represents an active ester of the water-soluble crosslinking reagent and -NH2 represents an amino group of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin. By execution of this crosslinking reaction in a chain-like manner, a structure in which a plurality of molecules of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is chemically firmly bonded by the water-soluble crosslinking reagent is formed. The active ester group of this water-soluble crosslinking reagent is also capable of reacting with amino groups of a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and proteins, such as collagen, existing in a biological tissue to form an amide linkage. By so doing, a structural that is more chemically firmly bonded is formed. As shown in Fig. 2, hydrophobic groups each having a certain molecular weight and size permeates a tissue by a hydrophobic interaction, so that the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is firmly fixed to the tissue. By so doing, the construct is physically firmly bonded to the surface of the tissue. More preferably, the adhesive component includes a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and an hydrophobically unmodified, fish-derived gelatin. By this, aggregation of hydrophobic groups can be inhibited and the bonding strength of the tissue adhesive can thereby be enhanced. <Method for producing tissue adhesive> Next, a description is made to a method for producing a tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention. The method for producing of the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention includes a step of mixing an adhesive component including an aqueous solution of a fish-derived gelatin with a curable component including an aqueous solution of a water-soluble crosslinking reagent, wherein the molecular main chain of the water-soluble molecule includes an amide linkage or an ethylene glycol unit or a sugar chain and also has two or more of an active ester group or an acid anhydride or an aldehyde group. The method for producing a tissue adhesive of the present invention more preferably includes a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin synthesis step S1, an adhesive component preparation step S2, and a curable component preparation step S3. (Hydrophobically modified, Fish-derived gelatin synthesis step S1) First, a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is synthesized by adding an organic molecule having a hydrophobic group to a solution in which a fish-derived gelatin in which the number of hydroxyproline per 1000 constitutional amino acids is 90 or less is dissolved in the presence of an amine to substitute a part of the amino groups on a side chain of the fish-derived gelatin. For example, an acid chloride having a hydrophobic group reactive with an amino group is mixed with a fish-derived gelatin dissolved in an organic solvent in the presence of triethylamine, preparing a mixed solution in a container. As the organic solvent, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) can be used, for example. The organic molecule may be exemplified by cholesteryl chloroformate represented by the following formula (5). Next, the mixture solution is heated and stirred under an inert gas atmosphere. For example, this can be done under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating temperature of 80Â°C for a stirring time of a day and a night. Next, this mixed solution is added dropwise to an ice cold ethanol solvent. Next, this solution is filtrated through a glass filter or the like. Furthermore, the filtrated matter is washed with an organic solvent. By so doing, impurities in the filtrated matter can be removed so as to increase the purity of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin. Regarding this organic solvent for the washing purpose, ethanol or ethyl acetate can be used, for example. By the above-mentioned step, a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin in which a part of the amino groups on side chains of a fish-derived gelatin have been substituted with a hydrophobic group can be produced. (Adhesive component preparation step S2) The hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is dispersed in a phosphate buffer solution, thereby preparing an adhesive component composed of an aqueous solution containing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin. The time before the solidification can be appropriately set by appropriately setting the pH of the phosphate buffer solution. A crosslinking reaction at the time of mixing can be advanced rapidly by use of the buffer solution having a pH of 6 to 8. (Curable component preparation step S3) A water-soluble crosslinking reagent, the molecular main chain of which includes an amide linkage or an ethylene glycol unit or a sugar chain and which has two or more of an active ester group or an acid anhydride or an aldehyde group, is dispersed in a phosphate buffer solution and thereby a curable component composed of an aqueous solution containing the water-soluble crosslinking reagent is prepared. The time before the solidification can be appropriately set by appropriately setting the pH of the phosphate buffer solution. A crosslinking reaction at the time of mixing can be advanced rapidly by use of the buffer solution having a pH of 6 to 8. By executing the steps described above, the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention can be produced easily. By mixing the adhesive component with the curable component, applying the mixture to a tissue, and then adhering another tissue, the two tissues can easily be bonded together. <Method for producing tissue adhesive (another example)> Next, a description is made to another example of the method for producing a tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention. The other example of the method for producing a tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention includes a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin synthesis step S11, a step S12 of preparing an aqueous solution containing a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin, a step S13 of preparing an aqueous solution containing a fish-derived gelatin, an adhesive component preparation step S14, and a curable component preparation step S15. The hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin synthesis step S11 is the same step as the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin synthesis step S1 descried previously. The step S12 of preparing an aqueous solution containing a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is the same as the adhesive component preparation step S2 described previously. (Step S13 of preparing an aqueous solution containing a fish-derived gelatin) By dispersing a fish-derived gelatin in a phosphate buffer solution, an aqueous solution containing the fish-derived gelatin is prepared. The time before the solidification can be appropriately set by appropriately setting the pH of the phosphate buffer solution. A crosslinking reaction at the time of mixing can be advanced rapidly by use of the buffer solution having a pH of 6 to 8. (Adhesive component preparation step S14) An adhesive component composed of a mixed solution is prepared by mixing the aqueous solution containing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin with the aqueous solution containing the fish-derived gelatin. The weight ratio is preferably adjusted to 1 : 9 to 5 : 5, more preferable 1 : 9. By so doing, the dispersability can be improved and aggregation can be inhibited. The curable component preparation step S15 is the same step as the curable component preparation step S3 described previously. By executing the steps described above, the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention can be produced easily. By mixing the adhesive component with the curable component, applying the mixture to a tissue, and then adhering another tissue, the two tissues can easily be bonded together. Preferably, the volume ratio of the adhesive component to the curable component is adjusted to about 1 : 1. The dispersability can thereby be improved. The tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention can be prepared by dispersing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and the water-soluble crosslinking reagent uniformly in an aqueous solution and thereby a tissue adhesive having stable bonding properties can be produced. In addition, it is possible to make a tissue adhesive that is not in a gel state but can be in a liquid state and that can be applied to a tissue uniformly and is excellent in spreadability. In addition, covalent bond can be formed by making larger a molecular weight and crosslinking the amino groups of the hydrophobically modified, gelatin molecules with the active ester group or the acid anhydride or the aldehyde group of the crosslinking reagent. Furthermore, bonding strength can be enhanced and the hydrophobically modified, gelatin can be decomposed readily by an enzyme (collagenase) in the course of wound healing and biocompatibility can be enhanced by anchoring the hydrophobic groups into a tissue and thereby forming physically firm bond. Since the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured such that the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is a polymer in which two or more amino acids are linearly linked and a part of the amino groups of Lys contained as the amino acids are substituted with a hydrophobic group, covalent bond can be formed by crosslinking the amino groups existing in the fish-derived gelatin by the active ester groups of the crosslinking reagent and thereby the bonding strength can be improved, and the hydrophobically modified, gelatin can readily be decomposed by an enzyme (collagenase) in the course of wound healing and the biocompatibility can thereby be enhanced. The tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured such that the hydrophobic groups include one type or a combination of two or more types selected from the group consisting of an ethyl group (2 carbon atoms), propyl (3 carbon atoms), a butyl group (4 carbon atoms), a pentyl group (5 carbon atoms), a hexanoyl group (6 carbon atoms), a heptanoyl group (7 carbon atoms), an octanoyl group (8 carbon atoms), a nonanoyl group (9 carbon atoms), a decanoyl group (10 carbon atoms), an undecanoyl group (11 carbon atoms), a dodecanoyl group (12 carbon atoms), a tridecanoyl group (13 carbon atoms), a tetradecanoyl group (14 carbon atoms), a pentadecanoyl group (15 carbon atoms), a hexadecanoyl group (16 carbon atoms), a heptadecanoyl group (17 carbon atoms), a stearoyl group (18 carbon atoms), which are saturated fatty acids; isopropyl (3 carbon atoms), an isobutyl group (4 carbon atoms), an isopentyl group (5 carbon atoms), an isohexanoyl group (6 carbon atoms), an isoheptanoyl group (7 carbon atoms), an isooctanoyl group (8 carbon atoms), an isononanoyl group (9 carbon atoms), an isodecanoyl group (10 carbon atoms), an isoundecanoyl group (11 carbon atoms), an isododecanoyl group (12 carbon atoms), an isotridecanoyl group (13 carbon atoms), an isotetradecanoyl group (14 carbon atoms), an isopentadecanoyl group (15 carbon atoms), an isohexadecanoyl group (16 carbon atoms), an isopalmityl group (16 carbon atoms), an isoheptadecanoyl group (17 carbon atoms), an isostearoyl group (18 carbon atoms), which are branched saturated fatty acids; an oleyl group (18 carbon atoms, one unsaturated carbon atom), a linolenyl group (18 carbon atoms, two unsaturated carbon atoms), an Î±-linolenyl group (18 carbon atoms, three unsaturated carbon atoms), which are unsaturated fatty acids; and a cholesteryl group, which is a cell membrane component, physically firm bond is formed by anchoring hydrophobic groups into a tissue, and thereby bonding strength can be enhanced. Since the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured such that the fish-derived gelatin is a gelatin derived from a fish among tilapia, sea bream, and cod, the tissue adhesive can be prepared by dispersing the fish-derived gelatin uniformly in an aqueous solution and thereby a tissue adhesive having stable bonding properties can be produced. In addition, it is possible to make a tissue adhesive that is not in a gel state but can be in a liquid state and that can be applied to a tissue uniformly and is excellent in spreadability. Since the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured such that the molecular weight of the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin is not less than 50000 and less than 100000, it is possible to make the bond of the tissue adhesive be a covalent bond. Since the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured such that the water-soluble crosslinking reagent includes one type or a combination of two or more types selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol di-succinimidyl succinate, pentaerythritol poly(ethylene glycol) ether tetrasuccinimidyl glutarate, succinimidized poly-L-glutamic acid, an aldehyde group-introduced starch, and an aldehyde group-introduced dextran, it can be dissolved in a water solvent with high dispersability. Moreover, it is possible to bond tissues by crosslinking the amino groups of the hydrophobically modified, gelatin and the amino groups of proteins such as collagen or the like existing in the biological tissue with crosslinking reagents which have active ester groups or acid anhydrides in the molecule. Since the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured such that the water solvent used for the aqueous solution is a phosphate buffer solution (PBS) having a pH of from 6.0 to 8.0, the time before the solidification can be appropriately set. Since the tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured to include a fish-derived gelatin in which the number of hydroxyproline per 1000 constitutional amino acids thereof is 90 or less, aggregation of hydrophobic groups can be inhibited and the bonding strength of the tissue adhesive can be improved. Since the method for producing a tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured such that the method includes a step of adding an organic molecule having a hydrophobic group to a solution in which a fish-derived gelatin in which the number of hydroxyproline per 1000 constitutional amino acids is 90 or less is dissolved to substitute a part of the amino groups on a side chain of the fish-derived gelatin, thereby synthesizing a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin, a step of dispersing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin in a phosphate buffer solution, thereby preparing an adhesive component composed of an aqueous solution containing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin, and a step of dispersing a water-soluble crosslinking reagent, the molecular main chain of which includes an amide linkage or an ethylene glycol unit or a sugar chain and which has two or more of an active ester group or an acid anhydride or an aldehyde group, in a phosphate buffer solution, thereby preparing a curable component composed of an aqueous solution of the water-soluble crosslinking reagent, it is possible to prepare a tissue adhesive by dispersing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and the water-soluble crosslinking reagent uniformly in an aqueous solution and easily prepare a tissue adhesive being high in bonding strength, stable in bonding properties, and excellent in spreadability. The method for producing a tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured to include a step of adding an organic molecule having a hydrophobic group to a solution in which a fish-derived gelatin in which the number of hydroxyproline per 1000 constitutional amino acids is 90 or less is dissolved to substitute a part of the amino groups on a side chain of the fish-derived gelatin, thereby synthesizing a hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin, a step of dispersing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin in a phosphate buffer solution, thereby preparing an aqueous solution containing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin, and a step of dispersing the fish-derived gelatin in a phosphate buffer solution, thereby preparing an aqueous solution containing the fish-derived gelatin, a step of mixing the aqueous solution containing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin with the aqueous solution containing the fish-derived gelatin, thereby preparing an adhesive component composed of a mixed solution, and a step of dispersing a water-soluble crosslinking reagent, the molecular main chain of which includes an amide linkage or an ethylene glycol unit or a sugar chain and which has two or more of an active ester group or an acid anhydride or an aldehyde group, in a phosphate buffer solution, thereby preparing a curable component composed of an aqueous solution containing the water-soluble crosslinking reagent, it is possible to prepare a tissue adhesive by dispersing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin and the water-soluble crosslinking reagent uniformly in an aqueous solution and easily prepare a tissue adhesive being high in bonding strength, stable in bonding properties, and excellent in spreadability. In addition, aggregation of hydrophobic groups can be inhibited and the bonding strength of a tissue adhesive can be improved. Since the method for producing a tissue adhesive serving as an embodiment of the present invention is configured such that an adhesive component composed of the mixed solution is prepared by adjusting the weight ratio of the solution containing the hydrophobically modified, fish-derived gelatin to the aqueous solution containing the fish-derived gelatin to not less than 1 : 9 and less than 5 : 5, aggregation of hydrophobic groups can be inhibited and the bonding strength of a tissue adhesive can be improved. The tissue adhesive and the method for producing the same serving as the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments, and they may be executed with various modifications within the scope of the technical idea of the present invention. Specific examples of these embodiments are shown in the following Examples. However, the present invention is not to be limited to these Examples. Examples (Test Example 1) <Preparation of Gltn / 4S-PEG tissue adhesive for evaluation of dependency on concentration of water-soluble crosslinking reagent (4S-PEG)> First, a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (abbreviation: Gltn, MW: 70,000, hydroxyproline content: 79 units per 1000 amino acids, produced by Nitta Gelatin Inc.) as a fish gelatin, pentaerythritol poly(ethylene glycol) ether tetrasuccinimidyl glutarate (abbreviation: 4S-PEG, MW: 10,000, produced by NOF Corporation), and a physiological saline (produced by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) as a water-soluble crosslinking reagent were prepared. Then, a 0.1 M, pH 7.0 phosphate buffered saline (abbreviation: PBS) was prepared. Then, a gelatin solution (Gltn solution) was prepared by dissolving the Gltn in the 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0) so that the Gltn concentration might be 40 wt%. Then, five 4S-PEG solutions having concentrations of 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 17mM, respectively, were prepared by dissolving prescribed amounts of the 4S-PEG in the 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0). Then, tissue adhesives of Test Examples 1-1 to 1-5 were prepared by mixing the Gltn solution with each of the five 4S-PEG solutions in a volume ratio of 1 : 1. Next, these tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. <Bonding strength measurement (shear tensile measurement)> A bonding strength measurement by measurement of the shear tensile of a tissue adhesive was carried out. Figs. 4 to 6 are schematic diagrams of a bonding strength measurement. First, two porcine vascular membranes 50 (10 mm x 30 mm) were prepared. In each of the porcine vascular membranes 50, one side was named a media 51 and the other side was named an adventitia 52. Then, as illustrated in Fig. 4, a mask 53 made of a 0.5-mm thick silicon sheet being square in plan and sized about 12 mm on each side was placed on the media 51 at one end of one of the porcine vascular membranes 50. The mask 53 was provided with a hole 54 having a circular shape in plan being 10 mm in diameter. The mask 53 was provided at one side with a slit leading to the hole 54. Them, a tissue adhesive 60 was dropped on the media 51 exposed in the hole 54. Then, one end of the other porcine vascular membrane 50 was placed immediately such that the media 51 might be mutually superposed via the tissue adhesive 60. Then, as illustrated in Fig. 5, a 50-gram weight 55 was placed on the superimposed porcine vascular membranes 50. Then, the sample was incubated at 37Â°C for 10 minutes. Immediately after the incubation, as illustrated in Fig. 6, the other ends of the porcine vascular membranes 50 were cramped and fixed to supporters 62, 63, respectively, and then they were drawn in opposing directions, so that shear tensile measurement was carried out with a Texture Analyzer (manufactured by EKO Instruments Co., Ltd.). <Results of evaluation of dependency of bonding strength on concentration of water-soluble crosslinking reagent (4S-PEG)> It is assumed that the 4S-PEG used as a water-soluble crosslinking reagent causes salting-out in the presence of a salt and the bulk strength after crosslinking will lower. Therefore, the dependency of bonding strength on the concentration of the water-soluble crosslinking reagent (4S-PEG) was measured. The tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) was dissolved in a solvent that was a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. The result (the dependency of bonding strength on the concentration of the water-soluble crosslinking reagent (4S-PEG)) shown in Fig. 7 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 7, the adhesion strength exhibited a local maximum value when the 4S-PEG concentration was 15 mM. From the fact that the amount of the residual amino groups of the Gltn was determined to be 169.64 Âµmol / g by a trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid method, the condition for amino groups : succinimidyl groups = 1 : 1 is a 4S-PEG concentration of 17 mM. Therefore, it was presumed that the bonding strength became locally maximum by producing a state where the material was crosslinked so as to achieve amino groups : succinimidyl groups = 1 : 1. (Test Example 2) <Preparation of Gltn/4S-PEG tissue adhesive for evaluation of dependency on solvent pH value> First, 40 wt% solutions of a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) were prepared using solvents each being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5. Then, 4.5 mM 4S-PEG solutions were prepared using solvents each being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5. Then, tissue adhesives of Test Examples 2-1 to 2-4 were prepared each by mixing a Gltn solution with a 4S-PEG solution having the same pH value, in a volume ratio of 1 : 1. Next, these tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. In addition, for comparison, the bonding strength of a commercially available tissue adhesive (Gelatin Resorcinol Formaldehyde: expressed as GRF) composed of gelatin and formaldehyde was also measured. <Results of evaluation of dependency of bonding strength on solvent (PBS) pH value> The crosslinking reaction of this tissue adhesive is a nucleophilic substitution reaction of the amino groups of gelatin to the active ester groups of 4S-PEG, and the reaction rate thereof depends on the protonation of the amino groups, i.e., the pH value of the solvent. For this reason, the dependency of bonding strength on a solvent (PBS) pH value was measured. The result (the dependency of bonding strength on a solvent (PBS) pH value) shown in Fig. 8 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 8, the bonding strength exhibited a local maximum value when the pH value of the solvent (PBS) was 7.0. In addition, Fig. 9 to Fig. 12 are cross-sectional images of the tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin after bonding strength measurements using the adhesives of Test Example 2-1 to 2-4, respectively. The preparation conditions for the individual adhesives are Gltn 40wt% soln. 4S-PEG 4.5 mM (0.1 M PBS pH 6.0 (Test Example 2-1), 6.5 (Test Example 2-2), 7.0 (Test Example 2-3), 7.5 (Test Example 2-4)). For comparison, a cross-sectional image of a tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin after a bonding strength measurement using GRF is shown in Fig. 13. In all of Fig. 9 to Fig. 13, the cured adhesive (upper part) observed was broken. (Example 1) <Preparation of 4Chol-Gltn / Gltn (1 : 9) / 4S-PEG tissue adhesive> First, hydrophobically modified,a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Chol-Gltn), at a hydrophobic group (Chol) introduction ratio of 4 mol% relative to all the amino groups in the Gltn was prepared. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a hydrophobically modified,tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (4Chol-Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, a mixed solution was prepared so that a mixture ratio (weight ratio) of Chol-Gltn solution : Gltn solution = 1 : 9 might be attained. Then, a 15 mM 4S-PEG solution was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, a tissue adhesive of Example 1 was prepared by mixing the mixed solution and the 4S-PEG solution in a volume ratio of 1 : 1. Next, this tissue adhesive was pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then was subjected to a bonding strength measurement at bonding times of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 (min). <Results of evaluation of dependency of bonding strength on bonding time> The result (the dependency of bonding strength on bonding time) shown in Fig. 14 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 14, the bonding strength became almost the maximum and saturated at a bonding time of 10 minutes and even though the bonding time was further elongated, the bonding strength did not vary significantly. (Example 2) <Preparation of 0, 4, 7, 23, and 70Chol-Gltn / 4S-PEG tissue adhesives> First, a hydrophobically modified, tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Chol-Gltn) at hydrophobic group (Chol group) introduction ratios of 4, 7, 23, and 70 mol% relative to all the amino groups in the Gltn were prepared. In addition, an hydrophobically unmodified, tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin was also subjected to evaluation, which is expressed as 0Chol-Gltn. Then, 40 wt% solutions of the hydrophobically unmodified, tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (0Chol-Gltn) and the hydrophobically modified, tilapia scale-derived fish gelatins (4, 7, 23, 70Chol-Gltn) were prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.4. Then, a 4.5 mM 4S-PEG solution was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.4. Then, tissue adhesives of Examples 2-1 to 2-5 were prepared by mixing each of the five Chol-Gltn solutions with a 4S-PEG solution in a volume ratio of 1 : 1. Next, these tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. In addition, for comparison, the bonding strength of a commercially available tissue adhesive (Gelatin Resorcinol Formaldehyde : expressed as GRF) composed of gelatin and formaldehyde was also measured. <Results of evaluation of dependency of bonding strength on hydrophobic group (Chol group) introduction ratio> This research has intended to create Chol-Gltn / 4S-PEG with which a hydrophobic group (Chol group) has a tissue penetrating capability to a hydrophobic region of ECM. For this reason, evaluation of the bonding strength of tissue adhesives prepared by mixing each of 40 wt% solutions of 0, 4, 7, 23, and 70Chol-Gltn with a 4S-PEG solution in a volume ratio 1 : 1 was carried out and thereby the dependency of bonding strength on hydrophobic group (Chol group) introduction ratio was evaluated. The result (the dependency of bonding strength on hydrophobic group (Chol group) introduction ratio) shown in Fig. 15 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 15, 4, 7, 23, and 70Chol-Gltns exhibited lower bonding strengths than 0Chol-Gltn. Among the hydrophobically modified, gelatins, the bonding strength of 7Chol-Gltn was the highest, and 4Chol-Gltn and 23Chol-Gltn were second highest in bonding strength. It is believed that the reason for this result was that the introduced Chol groups aggregated and failed to contribute to the permeability into a tissue and that the bulk strength of the tissue adhesive was lowered by the aggregation. Mixing of Gltn with Chol-Gltn can inhibit the aggregation of Chol groups and may potentially enhance the bonding strength of the tissue adhesive. For this reason, experiments in which the mixture ratio of the Chol-Gltn solution and the Gltn solution was varied were carried out in Examples 5 and 6. (Example 3) <Preparation of 4Chol-Gltn / Gltn (0 : 10 to 9 : 1) / 4S-PEG tissue adhesive> First, a 40 wt% solution of 4Chol-Gltn was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.4. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.4. Then, six mixed solutions were prepared while adjusting the weight ratio of the 4Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution to 0 : 10, 1 : 9, 3 : 7, 5 : 5, 7 : 3, and 9 : 1. Then, a 4.5 mM 4S-PEG solution was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.4. Then, each of the six Chol-Gltn solutions and the 4S-PEG solution were mixed in a volume ratio of 1 : 1. The tissue adhesives of Examples 3-1 to 3-6 were thereby prepared. These tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. In addition, for comparison, the bonding strength of a commercially available tissue adhesive (Gelatin Resorcinol Formaldehyde: expressed as GRF) composed of gelatin and formaldehyde was also measured. <Result of evaluation of the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of 4Chol-Gltn solution to Gltn solution> The result (the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of the 4Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution) shown in Fig. 16 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 16, the highest bonding strength was exhibited at a time of 4Chol-Gltn solution : Gltn solution = 1 : 9 (weight ratio). In addition, the sample of 5 : 5 (weight ratio) exhibited a higher bonding strength than the sample of Gltn alone. Figs. 17 to 22 are cross-sectional images of the tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin after bonding strength measurements using the adhesives of Example 3-1 to 3-5, respectively. The preparation conditions for the individual adhesives are 4Chol-Gltn / Gltn = 0 : 10 (Example 3-1), 1 : 9 (Example 3-2), 3 : 7 (Example 3-3), 5 : 5 (Example 3-4), 7 : 3 (Example 3-5), 9 : 1 (Example 3-6), 40 wt% soln. (0.1 M PBS pH 7.4), and 4S-PEG 4.5 mM (0.1 M PBS pH 7.4). In all of Fig. 17 to Fig. 22, the cured adhesive (upper part) observed was broken. (Example 4) <Preparation of 7Chol-Gltn / Gltn (0 : 10 to 9 : 1) / 4S-PEG tissue adhesive> First, a 40 wt% solution of 7Chol-Gltn and Gltn was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.4. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.4. Then, six mixed solutions were prepared while adjusting the weight ratio of the 7Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution to 0:10, 1:9, 3:7, 5:5, 7:3, and 9:1. Then, a 4.5 mM 4S-PEG solution was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.4. Then, six mixed solutions were prepared while adjusting the weight ratio of the 7Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution to 0:10, 1:9, 3:7, 5:5, 7:3, and 9:1. Then, tissue adhesives of Examples 4-1 to 4-6 were prepared by mixing each of the six Chol-Gltn solutions with a 4S-PEG solution in a volume ratio of 1:1. These tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. In addition, for comparison, the bonding strength of a commercially available tissue adhesive (Gelatin Resorcinol Formaldehyde: expressed as GRF) composed of gelatin and formaldehyde was also measured. <Result of evaluation of the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of 7Chol-Gltn solution to Gltn solution> The result (the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of the 7Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution) shown in Fig. 23 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 23, the highest bonding strength was exhibited at a time of 7Chol-Gltn solution:Gltn solution = 1:9 (weight ratio). In addition, the sample of 5:5 (weight ratio) exhibited a higher bonding strength than the sample of Gltn alone. (Example 5) <Preparation of 4Chol-Gltn / Gltn (0:10, 1:9, 5:5) / 4S-PEG tissue adhesives> First, a hydrophobically modified tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (4Chol-Gltn), at a hydrophobic group (Chol) introduction ratio of 4% was prepared. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a hydrophobically modified tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (4Chol-Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, three mixed solutions were prepared so that mixture ratios (weight ratios) of 4Chol-Gltn solution : Gltn solution = 0 : 10, 1 : 9, 5 : 5 might be attained. Then, a 15 mM 4S-PEG solution was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, tissue adhesives of Examples 5-1 to 5-3 were prepared by mixing each of the three mixed solutions with a 4S-PEG solution in a volume ratio of 1:1. These tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. In addition, for comparison, the bonding strength of a commercially available tissue adhesive (Gelatin Resorcinol Formaldehyde: expressed as GRF) composed of gelatin and formaldehyde was also measured. <Result of evaluation of the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of 4Chol-Gltn solution to Gltn solution> The result (the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of the 4Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution) shown in Fig. 24 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 24, the highest bonding strength was exhibited at a time of 4Chol-Gltn solution : Gltn solution = 1 : 9 (weight ratio). (Example 6) <Preparation of 7Chol-Gltn / Gltn (0 : 10, 1 : 9, 5 : 5) / 4S-PEG tissue adhesives> First, a hydrophobically modified tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (7Chol-Gltn) at a hydrophobic group (Chol) introduction ratio of 7% was prepared. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a hydrophobically modified tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (7Chol-Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, three mixed solutions were prepared so that mixture ratios (weight ratios) of 7Chol-Gltn solution:Gltn solution = 0:10, 1:9, 5:5 might be attained. Then, a 15 mM 4S-PEG solution was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, tissue adhesives of Examples 6-1 to 6-3 were prepared by mixing each of the three mixed solutions with a 4S-PEG solution in a volume ratio of 1:1. These tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. In addition, for comparison, the bonding strength of a commercially available tissue adhesive (Gelatin Resorcinol Formaldehyde: expressed as GRF) composed of gelatin and formaldehyde was also measured. <Result of evaluation of the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of 7Chol-Gltn solution to Gltn solution> The result (the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of the 7Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution) shown in Fig. 25 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 25, the highest bonding strength was exhibited at a time of 7Chol-Gltn solution : Gltn solution = 1 : 9 (weight ratio). (Example 7) <Preparation of 23Chol-Gltn / Gltn (0 : 10, 1 : 9, 5 : 5) / 4S-PEG tissue adhesives> First, a hydrophobically modified tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (23Chol-Gltn) at a hydrophobic group (Chol) introduction ratio of 23% was prepared. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a hydrophobically modified tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (23Chol-Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, three mixed solutions were prepared so that mixture ratios (weight ratios) of 23Chol-Gltn solution:Gltn solution = 0:10, 1:9, 5:5 might be attained. Then, a 15 mM 4S-PEG solution was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, tissue adhesives of Examples 7-1 to 7-3 were prepared by mixing each of the three mixed solutions with a 4S-PEG solution in a volume ratio of 1 : 1. These tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. In addition, for comparison, the bonding strength of a commercially available tissue adhesive (Gelatin Resorcinol Formaldehyde: expressed as GRF) composed of gelatin and formaldehyde was also measured. <Result of evaluation of the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of 23Chol-Gltn solution to Gltn solution> The result (the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of the 23Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution) shown in Fig. 26 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 26, the highest bonding strength was exhibited at a time of 23Chol-Gltn solution : Gltn solution = 0:10 (weight ratio). (Example 8). <Preparation of 70Chol-Gltn / Gltn (0 : 10, 1 : 9, 5 : 5) / 4S-PEG tissue adhesives> First, a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (70Chol-Gltn) hydrophobically modified, at a hydrophobic group (Chol) introduction ratio of 70% was prepared. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a hydrophobically modified tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (70Chol-Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, a 40 wt% solution of a tilapia scale-derived fish gelatin (Gltn) was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, three mixed solutions were prepared so that mixture ratios (weight ratios) of 70Chol-Gltn solution : Gltn solution = 0 : 10, 1 : 9, 5 : 5 might be attained. Then, a 15 mM 4S-PEG solution was prepared using a solvent being a 0.1 M PBS adjusted to pH 7.0. Then, tissue adhesives of Examples 8-1 to 8-3 were prepared by mixing each of the three mixed solutions with a 4S-PEG solution in a volume ratio of 1 : 1. These tissue adhesives were pre-incubated at 37Â°C beforehand and then were subjected to a bonding strength measurement. In addition, for comparison, the bonding strength of a commercially available tissue adhesive (Gelatin Resorcinol Formaldehyde: expressed as GRF) composed of gelatin and formaldehyde was also measured. <Result of evaluation of the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of 70Chol-Gltn solution to Gltn solution> The result (the dependency of bonding strength on the weight ratio of the 70Chol-Gltn solution to the Gltn solution) shown in Fig. 27 was obtained. As shown in Fig. 27, the highest bonding strength was exhibited at the time of 70Chol-Gltn solution : Gltn solution = 0 : 10 (weight ratio). The results shown in Figs. 7 to 27 revealed that, regarding 4 to 70Chol-Gltns, a tissue adhesive having a weight ratio of 1:9 exhibited a higher bonding strength than a tissue adhesive having a weight ratio of 5:5. Fig. 28 is a graph showing the dependency of the bonding strength of a tissue adhesive in a weight ratio of 1 : 9 on the hydrophobic group introduction ratio. As shown in Fig. 28, at a weight ratio of 1:9, the bonding strength of the tissue adhesive of 7Chol-Gltn / Gltn took a local maximum. None of the tissue adhesives prepared in the Examples were in a gel state and it was possible to use all of them in their original liquid state. Therefore, they were much higher in ease of handling than a tissue adhesive using a porcine gelatin having a molecular weight of about 20000. The tissue adhesive prepared using the mixed solution of a 40 wt% solution (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0) of 7Chol-Gltn / Gltn in a weight ratio of 1:9 and a 15 mM 4S-PEG solution (0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0) exhibited the highest bonding strength. The tissue adhesives prepared in the other Examples exhibited higher bonding strength than a commercially available GRF.

pressure resistance to porcine aorta (1-1) Experimental method The bonding strength to a porcine aorta of a tissue adhesive composed of an Hx-cGltn prepared by hexanoylizing a part of amino groups of cod gelatin (cGltn) and 4S-PEG was examined. Specifically, the cod gelatin used was one having a molecular weight of 153,000 and a hydroxyproline content of 50 units per 1000 amino acids. Then, a hydrophobically unmodified, 40% cGltn was prepared as an adhesive component (expressed as Org-cGltn solution or Org), an aqueous solution containing a water-soluble crosslinking agent 4S-PEG was prepared as a curable component (4S-PEG solution), and then a 1.0-mm thick sealant (tissue adhesive) was prepared by mixing 200 Âµl of the adhesive component with 200 Âµl of the curable component. Likewise, hydrophobically unmodified, cGltns each having a hexanoyl group introduction ratio of 2.1 mol%, 8.5 mol%, or 18.3 mol% were prepared as an adhesive component (expressed as 2.1 Hx, 8.5Hx, and 18.3Hx), and then 1.0-mm thick sealants (tissue adhesives) were prepared by mixing 200 Âµl of these adhesive components with 200 Âµl of that curable component. The concentration of 4S-PEG was set so that the amount of amino groups in the cGltn or the hydrophobically modified cGltn and the amount of succinimide groups in 4S-PEG might be in a ratio of 1:1. Then, after the application of each of the sealants (tissue adhesives), crimping was performed for 10 minutes under a load of 5.0 g / mm2 and thereby a pressure resistance test was performed. In the pressure resistance test of the sealants (tissue adhesives), the measurement of pressure-resisting strength to a porcine aorta was performed in accordance with ASTM (F2392-04, Standard Test Method for Burst Strength of Surgical Sealants). (1-2) Result The results are shown in Table 6. [Table 6]Org2.1 Hx8.5 Hx18.3 HxAverage (mmHg)96.3246.9233.0202.2Standard deviation9.412.811.39.2 Table 6 shows that the cases where the hydrophobically modified cGltn was used as an adhesive component at all of 2.1 Hx, 8.5Hx, and 18.3Hx exhibited pressure-resistant strengths being about twice or more the case where the hydrophobically unmodified, Org-cGltn was used as an adhesive component. Since a high value was exhibited also at 2.1 Hx, a high interface strength with a tissue was believed to be obtained even at a low hydrophobic group introduction ratio. It has been confirmed regarding cod gelatin that hydrophobically modification was very effective for enhancing bonding strength. (Example 10) Qualitative evaluation of sealant to rat organ A 40% hydrophobically unmodified cGltn was prepared as an adhesive component (Org-cGltn solution), an aqueous solution containing a water-soluble crosslinking agent 4S-PEG was prepared as a curable component (4S-PEG solution), and then a sealant (tissue adhesive) was prepared by mixing this adhesive component with this curable component. This sealant (tissue adhesive) was dropped in an amount of 50 Âµl to a surface of a rat organ. The sample was left at rest in a 37Â°C physiological saline for three days and then was qualitatively evaluated according to the amount of the residual adhesive. Likewise, a hydrophobically modified cGltn having a hydrophobic group introduction ratio of 2.1 mol% was prepared as an adhesive component (2.1 Hx) and then a sealant (tissue adhesive) was prepared by mixing this adhesive component with that curable component. This sealant (tissue adhesive) was dropped in an amount of 50 Âµl to a surface of a rat organ. The sample was left at rest in a 37Â°C physiological saline for three days and then was qualitatively evaluated according to the amount of the residual adhesive. As a result, it was revealed that the bonding properties especially to a lung surface and a kidney surface were improved by the use of the hydrophobically modified cGltn (2.1Hx) as an adhesive component. In contrast, almost no bonding property to organs were confirmed when an Org-cGltn solution was used as an adhesive component. (Example 11) Examination of the influence of hydrophobic group introduction ratio (1) Experimental method (1-1) A Chol-cGltn in which a part of amino groups of cod gelatin (cGltn) had been cholesterylized was prepared as an adhesive component (expressed as Org-cGltn solution or Org), an aqueous solution containing a water-soluble crosslinking agent 4S-PEG was prepared as a curable component (4S-PEG solution), and then a sealant (tissue adhesive) was prepared by mixing the adhesive component with the curable component. Likewise, hydrophobically modified cGltns each having a hydrophobic group introduction ratio of 4.9 mol%, 7.5 mol%, or 12.2 mol% by cholesteryl group were prepared as an adhesive component, and sealants (tissue adhesives) were prepared by mixing these adhesive components with the curable component. Afresh porcine aortic media was used as an adherend and a sealant (tissue adhesive) was applied to this porcine aortic media. After crimping, the strength when the sealant was peeled in a direction perpendicular to the bonded surface was taken as bonding strength. (1-2) The detailed conditions are as follows. Applied force (crimping load) 5.0 g / mm2 Contact time (crimping time) 5 min Solution pH: 0.1 M PBS (pH 8) NHS ratio in NH2/4S-PEG = 1/0.85 (NHS: N-hydroxysuccinimide) Chol-cGltn, cGltn concentration: 40 w/v% Control: commercially available GRF glue (2) Results Bonding strength increased with introduction of a cholesteryl group up to 7.5 mol% and then decreased. The maximum bonding strength was 1.5 times higher than unmodified cGltn (Org) and 13.8 times higher than a commercial product. Since the condition of a fracture surface shown in Fig. 29 shows that an adhesive remained on the tissue interface in the case of a 7.5 mol% Chol-cGltn, it has been revealed that the adhesive had an interface adhesion property enhanced by cholesteryl group. (3) Other hydrophobic groups Under the same conditions as in (1) described above, the influence of hydrophobic group introduction ratio on bonding strength was examined also for a propyl group (Pro), a hexanoyl group (Hx), and a lauryl group (Lau). The results are shown in Table 7. In Table 7 are also shown the results attained by the above-mentioned cholesteryl group.

In addition, it was also confirmed that a propyl group (Pro), a hexanoyl group (Hx), and a lauryl group (Lau) each enhance bonding strength depending upon a hydrophobic group introduction ratio. Industrial Applicability The tissue adhesive of the present invention and the method for producing the same relate to a tissue adhesive that enhances bonding strength, that is not in a gel state but can be used in its original liquid state, and that eases handling. Therefore, they are applicable in the industrial fields where a tissue adhesive, a tissue sealant, a hemostatic agent, and the like are required, and the like.
