Step 8: To a solution of ethyl 7-[methyl-[7-(tosyl)pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl] amino]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-carboxylate (1.5 g, 3.0 mmol) in EtOH (20 mL) was added NaOEt (1.0 g, 15 mmol) at 25°C, and stirred at this temperature for 16 hours. TLC (DCM:MeOH=10:1) showed that the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with water (50 mL), and the water phase was extracted with DCM/MeOH(10:1, 50 mL×3). The combined organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified through column chromatography (silicon dioxide, DCM/MeOH=1/0∼10:1) to give ethyl 7-[methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-carboxylate (WX550, Intermediate 2) (600 mg, 1.76 mmol, 58.2% yield) as a white solid compound.
