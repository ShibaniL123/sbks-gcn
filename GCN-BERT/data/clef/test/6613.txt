[00172] The term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another substituent, represent a straight (i.e. unbranched) or branched chain, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. Ci-Cio means one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec -butyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n- hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. [00173] The term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH2-CH2-0-CH3, -CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH3, - CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH3, -CH2-CH2-NH-CH3, -CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH3, -CH2- S-CH2-CH3, -CH2-CH2-S(0)-CH3, -CH2-CH2-S(0)2-CH3, -CH=CH-0-CH3, -Si(CH3)3, -CH2- CH=N-OCH3, -CH=CH-N(CH3)-CH3, O-CH3, -0-CH2-CH3, and -CN. Two or more heteroatoms may also be consecutive. [00174] The terms "cycloalkyl" and "heterocycloalkyl," by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and "heteroalkyl", respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3- cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.

Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to: like. [00175] The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term "halo(Ci-C4)alkyl" is meant to include, but not be limited to, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like. [00176] The term "aryl" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) which are fused together (i.e. a fused ring aryl) or linked covalently. A fused ring aryl refers to multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is an aryl ring. [00177] The term "heteroaryl" refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. Thus, the term "heteroaryl" includes fused ring heteroaryl groups (i.e. multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is a heteroaromatic ring). A 5,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 5 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. Likewise, a 6,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. And a 6, 5-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 5 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2- imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, triazolyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4- oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2- pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1 -isoquinolyl, 5- isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below. [00178] An "arylene" and a "heteroarylene," alone or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an aryl and heteroaryl, respectively. [00179] For brevity, the term "aryl" when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term "arylalkyl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (e.g., a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (e.g., phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(l-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like). [00180] Each of the above terms (e.g., "alkyl," "heteroalkyl," "aryl" and "heteroaryl") are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below. [00181] As used herein, the term "heteroatom" or "ring heteroatom" is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si). [00182] As used herein, the term "about" a number or range of numbers refers to that number or range of numbers plus or minus 10% of that number or that range of numbers minus 10% of the lowest listed member of the range and plus 10% of the highest listed member of the range. [00183] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present disclosure contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present disclosure contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, oxalic, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts", Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present disclosure contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts. [00184] In some cases, the compounds of the present disclosure exist as salts, such as with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The present disclosure conemplates such salts. Examples of such salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, methanesulfonates, nitrates, maleates, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates (e.g., (+)-tartrates, (-)-tartrates or mixtures thereof including racemic mixtures), succinates, benzoates and salts with amino acids such as glutamic acid. In some cases, these salts are prepared, for example, by methods known to those skilled in the art. [00185] The neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties in some cases, such as solubility in polar solvents. [00186] In addition to salt forms, the present disclosure provides compounds, which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present disclosure. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present disclosure by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment.

[00188] Certain compounds of the present disclosure possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, tautomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, compounds which are known in the art to be too unstable to synthesize and/or isolate are excluded. [00189] In some cases, the compounds of the present disclosure contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. In some cases, the compounds are radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present disclosure, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. [00190] The terms "treating" or "treatment" refers to any indicia of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; making the final point of degeneration less debilitating; improving a patient's physical or mental well-being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination, neuropsychiatric exams, and/or a psychiatric evaluation. For example, the certain methods presented herein successfully treat cancer by decreasing the incidence of cancer, in inhibiting its growth and or causing remission of cancer. [00191] An "effective amount" is an amount of a compound described herein sufficient to contribute to the treatment, prevention, or reduction of a symptom or symptoms of a disease, or to inhibit effects of an amyloid relative to the absence of the compound. In some cases, where recited in reference to a disease treatment, an "effective amount" is also referred to as a "therapeutically effective amount." A "reduction" of a symptom or symptoms (and grammatical equivalents of this phrase) means decreasing of the severity or frequency of the symptom(s), or elimination of the symptom(s). A "prophylactically effective amount" of a drug is an amount of a drug that, when administered to a subject, will have the intended prophylactic effect, e.g., preventing or delaying the onset (or reoccurrence) a disease, or reducing the likelihood of the onset (or reoccurrence) of a disease or its symptoms. In some cases, the full prophylactic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and occur only after administration of a series of doses. In some cases, a prophylactically effective amount is administered in one or more administrations. An "activity decreasing amount," as used herein, refers to an amount of antagonist required to decrease the activity of an enzyme relative to the absence of the antagonist. A "function disrupting amount," as used herein, refers to the amount of antagonist required to disrupt the function of an osteoclast or leukocyte relative to the absence of the antagonist. [00192] In some cases, diseases or conditions that are treated with the compounds of the present disclosure include diseases or conditions accompanied by protein that produces amyloid like morphology and disease or conditions associated with the formation of abnormal protein structures, protein aggregation, or protein misfolding. In some cases, an abnormal protein structure is a protein structure that arises when a protein or peptide refolds from the three- dimensional structure, which it generally adopts in healthy individuals, into a different three- dimensional structure, which is associated with a pathological condition. In some cases, diseases or conditions that are treated with the compounds of the present disclosure are diseases or conditions associated with amyloid or amyloid-like proteins. In some cases, such diseases are referred to as amyloid based diseases or conditions. Amyloid based diseases or conditions, include any disease or condition that is associated with amyloid or amyloid-like protein and is characterized, in part, by the buildup of extracellular deposits of amyloid or amyloid- like material. In the context of this disclosure, amyloid based diseases or conditions also include disease or conditions accompanied by protein that produces amyloid like morphology. These diseases include, but are not limited to, neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, diseases or conditions characterized by a loss of cognitive memory capacity such as, for example, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Lewy body dementia, Down's syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis (Dutch type); the Guam Parkinson-Dementia complex. Other diseases which are based on or associated with amyloid-like proteins are progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple sclerosis; Creutzfeldt Jacob disease, Parkinson's disease, HIV- related dementia, ALS (amyotropic lateral sclerosis), inclusion-body myositis (IBM), Adult Onset Diabetes; senile cardiac amyloidosis; endocrine tumors, and other diseases, including amyloid- associated ocular diseases that target different tissues of the eye, such as the visual cortex, including cortical visual deficits; the anterior chamber and the optic nerve, including glaucoma; the lens, including cataract due to beta- amyloid deposition; the vitreous, including ocular amyloidosis; the retina, including primary retinal degenerations and macular degeneration, in particular age-related macular degeneration; the optic nerve, including optic nerve drusen, optic neuropathy and optic neuritis; and the cornea, including lattice dystrophy. The term "amyloid protein" is intended to denote a protein which is involved in the formation of fibrils, plaques and/or amyloid deposits, either by being part of the fibrils, plaques and/or deposits as such or by being part of the biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of the fibrils, plaques and/or amyloid deposits. In the present context the term "protein" or is intended to mean both short peptides of from 2 to 10 amino acid residues, oligopeptides of from 1 1 to 100 amino acid residues, polypeptides of more than 100 amino acid residues, and full length proteins. The terms also encompass peptides having substantial similarity to amyloid proteins, such as, e.g., structural variants. In some cases, the proteins occur naturally or be synthetically constructed. The term amyloid protein or amyloid like protein also includes amyloidgenic proteins and proteins that produce amyloid like morphology. [00193] The term "substantial similarity" means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, share at least 50% sequence identity, or at least 60% sequence identity, or at least 70% sequence identity, or at least 80% sequence identity, or at least 90 percent sequence identity, or at least 95 percent sequence identity or more (e.g., 99% sequence identity). Preferably, residue positions, which are not identical, differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic -hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur- containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine- arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine. In some cases, residue positions, which are not identical are also composed of peptide analogs, including unnatural amino acids or derivatives of such. Analogs typically differ from naturally occurring peptides at one, two or a few positions, often by virtue of conservative substitutions. Some analogs also include unnatural amino acids or modifications of N or C terminal amino acids at one, two or a few positions. Examples of unnatural amino acids are D-amino acids, alpha, alpha- disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, 4-hydroxyproline, y- carboxyglutamate, epsilon-N,N,N-trimethyllysi- ne, epsilon-N-acetyllysine, O- phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, omega.-N- methylarginine, and isoaspartic acid. Overview [00194] In some cases, the disclosure provides novel compounds that are employed in the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of diseases or conditions associated with protein aggregation or protein misfolding. In some cases, the compounds of the disclosure are also employed in the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of amyloid based diseases or conditions. The disclosure further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of such diseases or conditions. [00195] The compounds of the disclosure are designed form a detectable complex in presence of an amyloid or amyloid-like protein. In some cases, the compounds disclosed herein are classified as molecular rotor fluorophores. The compounds comprise an electron rich donor moiety covalently connected to a conjugated pi system (for example, to an aromatic pi network) and in electronic conjugation to an electron poor acceptor moiety covalently connected elsewhere on the pi system. The compounds also comprise one or more single bonds between the donor and acceptor that can rotate freely under standard thermal control of the environment in the temperature range of interest. The rotation of the single bond allows the donor and acceptor to remain substantially decoupled in the absence of binding to a protein and thus the compounds exhibit poor fluorescence signal. However, in presence of an amyloid or amyloid-like protein these compounds may bind to amyloid or amyloid-like proteins. Accordingly, the rotatable single bonds may become essentially frozen and the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor may be substantially enhanced. In some cases, it leads to a strong fluorescence signal upon irradiation with an appropriate wavelength of light. In some cases, the strong fluorescence enhancement of these compounds upon binding to amyloid or amyloid- like proteins compared to the free compound in solution results in excellent signal to noise ratio and make it possible to image amyloid or amyloid-like proteins with high sensitivity. [00196] Also provided herein is a method for detecting an amyloid or amyloid-like protein. The method comprises contacting a compound of the disclosure or a pharmaceutical composition thereof with the sample potentially comprising the amyloid or amyloid-like protein, wherein in presence of an amyloid or amyloid-like protein the compound forms a detectable complex, and detecting the formation of the detectable complex such that the presence or absence of the detectable complex correlates with the presence or absence of the amyloid or amyloid like protein. In some cases, the detection of the detectable complex in the methods of the disclosure comprises illuminating the sample with light of an appropriate wavelength and detecting light received from the sample. In some cases, the wavelength of the illuminating light is varied and selected according to the fluorescence excitation and emission spectrum of the detectable complex. In some cases, the detectable complex has a fluorescent excitation peak in the range of 350-500 nm, and the fluorescence emission spectrum of the detectable complex in the range of 500-550 nm. In some cases, the illuminating light has a wavelength of 350-450 nm (example 400 nm). In some cases, amyloid or amyloid like protein or peptide is detected by the methods of the disclosure. In some cases, the method is used to detect the presence or absence of Αβ peptide, prion peptide, alpha-synuclein, or superoxide dismutase. [00197] The disclosure also provides a method of determining the presence or absence of one or more disease or condition in a subject. The method comprises administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of the disclosure or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, wherein in presence of the a disease or condition the administered compound forms a detectable complex, and detecting the formation of the detectable complex such that presence or absence of the detectable complex correlates with the presence or absence of the disease or condition. In some cases, the method includes comparing the amount of the detectable complex to a normal control value, wherein an increase in the amount of thedetectable complex compared to a normal control value indicates that said patient is suffering from or is at risk of developing the disease or condition. Also provided herein is a method of treating, preventing or alleviating the symptoms of a disease or condition in a subject. The method comprises administering to a subject in need of treatment an effective amount of a compound of the disclosure or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. In some cases, the subject is a mammal. In some case, the subject is a primate (such as a human), canine, feline, ovine, bovine and the like. [00198] In some cases, the disease or condition is a disease or condition characterized by protein aggregation or misfolding. In some cases, the disease or condition is also an amyloid based disease or condition. In some cases, the amyloid-based disease or condition is any disease or condition associated with the increased or decreased presence of amyloid or amyloid like proteins, such as the presence of amyloid plaques or other amyloid aggregates. In some cases, the disease is a neuronal disease. In some cases, the disease is a neurodegenerative diseases, in which amyloid-beta peptides, oligomers, fibrils, or plaques are implicated. In some cases, the disease is Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Lewy body dementia (LBD), or Down's syndrome. In some cases, the amyloid- based disease or condition also includes ocular diseases associated with pathological abnormalities/changes in the tissues of the visual system, particularly associated with amyloid- beta-related pathological abnormalities/changes in the tissues of the visual system, such as, for example, neuronal degradation. In some cases, pathological abnormalities occur, for example, in different tissues of the eye, such as the visual cortex leading to cortical visual deficits; the anterior chamber and the optic nerve leading to glaucoma; the lens leading to cataract due to beta-amyloid deposition; the vitreous leading to ocular amyloidosis; the retina leading to primary retinal degeneration and macular degeneration; the optic nerve leading to optic nerve drusen, optic neuropathy and optic neuritis; and the cornea leading to lattice dystrophy. [00199] In some cases, the compounds and the methods of the disclosure are also used to monitor minimal residual disease in a patient following treatment with a compound or a mixture according to the disclosure. In some cases, a sample or a specific body part or body area suspected to contain the amyloid antigen is contacted with a compound of the disclosure, and the compound is allowed to bind to the amyloid or amyloid like protein to form a detectable complex. In some cases, the formation of the detectable complex is detected and its presence or absence is correlated with the presence or absence of amyloid or amyloid like protein in the sample or specific body part or area. In some cases, the amount of said detectable complex is compared to a normal control value, wherein an increase in the amount of said detectable complex compared to a normal control value indicates that the patient may still be suffering from a minimal residual disease. [00200] In some cases, the compounds and methods disclosed herein are useful for predicting responsiveness of a patient to a treatment. In some cases, a sample or a specific body part or body area suspected to contain the amyloid or amyloid like protein is brought into contact with a compound of the disclosure, such that in presence of the amyloid or amyloid like protein the compound binds to the amyloid or amyloid like protein to form a detectable complex. In some cases, the formation of the detectable complex is detected and the presence or absence of the detectable complex is correlated with the presence or absence of amyloid or amyloid like protein in the sample or specific body part or area. In some cases, the amount of the detectable complex before and after onset of the treatment is compared, such that a decrease in the amount of the detectable complex indicates that the patient is being responsive to the treatment.

Example 9; In vitro amyloid binding and tissue staining studies [00842] Extensive in vitro work demonstrate that Compound 1 (Figure 13 A) displays privileged properties in terms of an ability to bind selectively to amyloids and emit a characteristic fluorescence upon binding to Alzheimer's related amyloids. Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B show the absorbance and emission profile of compound 1 free in solution (solid line) and bound (dashed line) to aggregated Alzheimer' s-related peptide (Αβ42). Fig. 2C shows a plot of fluorescence intensity versus concentration of compound 1 in the presence of aggregated A ?(l-42) peptide. Aggregated A ?(l-42) at a final concentration of 10 μΜ (based on the molecular weight of monomer) was mixed with increasing concentration of compound 1 (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 μΜ) in 5% DMSO in PBS. The ¾ was determined by fitting data to a one-site specific binding algorithm: Y = Bmx-X/(Ka + X), where X is the concentration of the probe, Y is the specific binding fluorescence intensity, and Bmax corresponds to the apparent maximal observable fluorescence upon binding of probes to aggregated A ?(l-42) peptide. [00843] In order to test whether Compound 1 could discriminate amyloids based on disease origin, the spectroscopic properties of Compound 1 when bound to amyloids derived from amyloid-β (associated with Alzheimer's disease), PrP (associated with CJD), and ot-synuclein (associated with Parkinson's disease) were examined. Fig. 18 shows that Compound 1 can distinguish between amyloids of different disease origin based on color of emission. These results demonstrate the potential specificity that Compound 1 can have for conclusively identifying amyloid deposits from AD patients versus any other disease origin. Example 10; Stability and Solubility studies for Compound 1 [00844] The rate of hydro lytic decomposition of Compound 1 in PBS (with 5% DMSO to aid in solubility) at 25°C by HPLC was examined. Fig. 19A shows the relative abundance of Compound 1 over a 24 hour period. These studies reveal that Compound 1 has a t 2 for hydrolysis of -150 hours. For comparison, ANCA-1 1 ((E)-2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl 2-cyano-3-(6-(piperidin-l-yl)naphthalen-2-yl)acrylate) exhibited a for hydrolysis of -1 1 hours under the same conditions. In certain in vivo environments (especially at high or low pH or in the presence of esterases), ANCA-11 is expected to decompose very rapidly due to the poor stability of its ester functionality. The amide functionality in Compound 1 alleviates the problem of hydro lytic instability inherent to ANCA-1 1. [00845] Some initial solubility studies have been carried out on Compound 1 (table 1). Compound 1 was soluble at a concentration of >5 mg/mL in all oils tested (Castor Oil (Ricinus Oil), Castor Oil (Ethyoxylated), corn oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, soyabean oil, and peanut oil). Table 1.

Compound 1 was very soluble in alcohols such as benzyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polysorbates and PEGs to a concentration of > 5 mg/mL. For the others listed, the solubility was 2-3 mg/ml. [00847] Additionally the solubility was tested in Surfactants such as: Tween 20, Tween 80, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, Neobee M-5. In these solvents, Compound 1 was very well soluble to a concentration of > 5 mg/mL. [00848] The solubility of Compound 1 in water increased as the pH was lowered to a pH < 5 (See Fig. 19B). [00849] These data are crucial to help with developing a suitable formulation for IV or topical administration of the probe for retinal imaging of amyloid in AD patients. Compound 1 solubility in various acids: [00850] Solubility of Compound 1 was tested in HC1, acetic, citric, succinic, and lactic acid buffer (20-50 mM) and at pH 2-6. At lower pH and higher buffer concentration, the solubility increased up to 350 μg/mL vs water which is 3 μg/mL, representing a 100 fold increase. A representative example is shown in Fig. 19C for citric acid buffer. [00851] Table 2 shows that at lower pH and higher acidic buffer strength, the solubility of Compound 1 can be increased to more than 6 mg/mL. The HC1 salt of Compound 1 is more soluble than the base in water and phosphate buffer. Phosphate buffer tends to decrease the solubility of the HC1 salt.

Methanol was removed and the solid was triturated with dry ethyl ether (5 x 10 mL) and dried in high vacuum overnight. Structure and purity was determined by analytical HPLC (comparing retention time to base), proton NMR, and mass spectrometric analysis.

Compound 1. *H NMR (500 MHz, CDC13) δ 8.33 (s, 1H), 8.1 1 (s, 1H), 8.00-8.02 (dd, J= 8.5 Hz, 1.5 Hz, 1H), 7.69-7.71 (d, J= 9.5 Hz, 1H), 7.60-7.62 (d, J= 8.5 Hz, 1H), 7.24-7.26 (m, 1H), 7.01 (bs, 1H), 6.84 (m, 1H), 3.64-3.66 (m, 6H), 3.62-3.63 (m, 4H), 3.54-3.55 (m, 2H), 3.35 (s, 3H), 3.12-3.34 (m, 4H), 1.69 (m, 4H), 1.61-1.62 (m, 2H) Compound 1-HCl: *H-NMR (500 MHz, CDC13): δ 8.59 (s, 1H), 8.44 (s, 1H), 8.37 (s, 1H), 8.15 (d, J= 8.5 Hz, 1H), 8.07 (d, J= 8.5 Hz, 1H), 8.02 (d, J= 9 Hz, 1H), 7.96 (d, J= 8.5 Hz, 1H), 6.94-6.95 (m, 1H), 3.64-3.68 (m, 11H), 3.55-3.57 (m, 5H), 3.36 (s, 3H), 2.37 (bd. s, 4H), 1.83 (bd, m, 2H) Preparation of the citrate salt: [00853] Compound 1 was dissolved in ethanol to which 1.2 molar equivalents of citric acid was added. The mixture was sonicated for dissolution, stirred at room temperature for 2 hrs and cooled to -4°C. The precipitate was filtered, washed with cold ethyl ether and dried under high vacuum. The sample was analyzed by analytical HPLC and retention time was confirmed to be that of parent, establishing the identity of the salt. Solubility of the citrate salt [00854] Solubility of citrate salt is 0.25 mg/ml, an increase of 140 fold versus water at pH 3.5. By comparison, the HCl salt of Compound 1 has a water solubility of 1.96 mg/ml. Example 12: Ex vivo studies [00855] Transgenic mice (J20) that overexpress the Swedish and Indiana mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and produce human beta-amyloid served as a convenient murine model of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Six J20 mice (and six wt littermate controls), bred and aged to 21 months, were dosed systemically (through the tail vein) with compound 1 (Test formulation: 100-150 μΐ^ of a 500 μΜ solution of compound 1 in 80% Propylene glycol/20% DMSO for in vivo injection) or vehicle alone. After injection, all mice were allowed to run free in the cage for 30 minutes. Mice were then sacrificed and the retinal tissue was harvested and visualized for compound 1 staining. [00856] For ex vivo analysis of retina, the eyes of J20 or wt mice injected with compound 1 or vehicle alone were removed from the mice within 1 minute of sacrifice and put on ice. The eyes were then dissected to remove the retina within 1 hour of sacrifice. Retina were then subjected to a short 5 minute methanol dehydration/fixation step, and then incubated with DAPI (nuclear stain), red fluorescent lectin (vascular stain), and an anti-Αβ antibody (followed by a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody). The retina were then flat mounted onto a glass coverslip and imaged via confocal microscopy. Fig. 20A and Fig. 20B show a 3D z-stack reconstruction of the retina of a J20 mouse injected with compound 1 30 minutes prior to sacrifice. The white arrows in Fig. 20A highlights several bright objects within the neuronal layers of the retina that are stained with compound 1. Amyloid deposits in the retina of tg mice and humans with AD have been reported to develop within the neuronal layers as a function of disease progression (Neuroimage 2011, 54, S204-S217). Fig. 20B is an image of the same retina shown in Fig. 20A, but highlighting only the location (white arrows) of the amyloid deposits stained by the anti-Αβ antibody (followed by a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody). The anti-Αβ antibody (highlighted by the white arrows in Fig. 20B) and compound 1 (highlighted by the white arrows in Fig. 20A) co-localize in the retina, providing very strong evidence that compound 1 can cross the blood-retina barrier and specifically stain amyloids in the retina after in vivo systemic administration. Example 13; Imaging of amyloid deposits in live animals [00857] In addition to the visualization of amyloid deposits through the harvesting of tissues and ex vivo imaging, recent efforts have shown the ability to image amyloid deposits in live animals. Three transgenic AD mice (hAPP/PSl, J20, and 5XFAD) mice have been bred and aged for imaging. While these AD tg mouse models age, an animal model of CJD, that has a much shorter timeline for amyloid deposit accumulation, has been investigated for live imaging of retinal amyloid accumulation after IP administration of Compound 1. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and placed on a stage afixed with a 37°C heating pad. The retina were imaged via bright field and fluorescence using a Phoenix Laboratory Micron IV rodent retinal microscope to establish a baseline image. [00858] Mice inoculated with GPI-anchorless strain of PrP served as an initial convenient animal model for Creutzfeldt-Jakobs Disease, and has been investigated for live imaging of retinal amyloid accumulation after IP administration of compound 1. For this demonstration, compound 1, dosed via intraperitoneal injection (Formulation: 200 μϊ^ of a 10 mg/mL solution of compound 1 in 20% DMSO/80% propylene glycol), allowed for the visualization of amyloid deposits in the retina. [00859] Fig. 21 A shows a bright field image of the retina of an anesthetized wt mouse. Fig 2 IB shows a bright field image of the retina of an anesthetized prion-infected (156 days post infection with GPI-anchorless PrP) mouse (J. Virol, 2011, 85, 1484-1494). The bright field images of the two different mice shown in Fig. 21 A and Fig. 2 IB are not sufficiently different as to distinguish a healthy versus diseased mouse (the dark area within each image is an artifact of the objectives on the rodent microscope [Phoenix labs Micron IV rodent retinal microscope] used to obtain these live mouse retinal images). Fig. 21C shows a fluorescence image of the retina of the wt mouse (same mouse retina shown in Fig. 21 A) immediately after IP injection with compound 1. The dull background fluorescence observable in Fig. 21C, as well as the slightly brighter green fluorescence seen in the retinal vasculature, demonstrates that compound 1 immediately accumulates in the blood and in the retinal tissue after IP injection. This dull background fluorescence is expected to fade over time as compound 1 is cleared from the mouse. Fig. 2 ID shows a fluorescence image of the retina of the prion-infected mouse (same mouse retina shown in Fig. 2 IB) immediately after IP injection with compound 1. Fig. 2 ID reveals very bright objects (due to staining with compound 1) located throughout the retina (highlighted with white arrows). These objects are consistent with prion amyloid deposits that have previously been reported to accumulate in the retina of mice inoculated with GPI-anchorless PrP (J. Virol, 2011, 85, 1484-1494). [00860] Fig. 22 A and Fig. 22B show a comparison of the fluorescence image of the retina of a living prion-infected mouse injected with Compound 1 and the retina of same mouse after sacrifice, removal of the retina, and examination ex vivo by confocal microscopy. Fig. 22 A is the same as Fig. 21D. Fig. 22B reveals many bright fluorescent objects (highlighted with white arrows) stained in vivo with Compound 1. No further processing (i.e., no further staining with Compound 1) was performed on the retinal tissue to obtain the fluorescence image in Fig. 22B. Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 21A-D and Figs.22A-B provide strong evidence that Compound 1 can quickly and readily be used for in vivo retina imaging of amyloid deposits as an indicator of disease. [00861] Fig. 23 shows a magnified, true color micrograph of an individual prion plaque from the same eye shown in Fig. 22. Spectroscopic inspection of Compound 1 bound to this amyloid deposit revealed a max (Em) = 554 nm, which precisely matched the emission wavelength of Compound 1 bound to prion plaques found in the brain. This result demonstrates that the spectroscopic specificity of Compound 1 for identifying and discriminating amyloid deposits from different disease origins can be achieved in the retina in an analogous manner as has been demonstrated in other parts of the brain. 1.
