Example 5: [p-(dimethylcarbamoylamino)phenyl]diphenyl phosphate (HA-V)
HA-V corresponds to a compound according to Formula (I) with m=1; n=2; p=0; X=O; R1=R2=methyl; R3=-O-phenyl; R6=H, wherein the -NHC(O)NR1R2 group is in the p-position.
28.83 g (160 mmol) N-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-N',N'-dimethylurea are suspended in 160 ml acetonitrile (100%, VWR) in an N2-washed three-necked flask with a return condenser, dropping funnel, thermometer and magnetic stirrer, 16.19 g (160 mmol) triethylamine (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) are added and the mixture being produced is cooled by means of an ice bath to a temperature of 0° C. A solution of 42.98 g (160 mmol) phosphoric acid diphenyl ester chloride (97%, ABCR) in 80 ml acetonitrile is added drop-wise by means of a dropping funnel in such a way that the temperature does not rise above 5° C. After the removal of the ice bath, the mixture is stirred for 90 min at room temperature and thereafter stirred again for 90 min at a temperature of 50° C. After cooling to room temperature, 400 ml water are added, a two-phase mixture being produced. The upper, aqueous phase is separated off and 240 ml water added to the organic phase. The solid being produced here is separated off, washed with water and dried at 60° C. in a vacuum.
