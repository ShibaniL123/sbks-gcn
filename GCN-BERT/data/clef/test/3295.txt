The disclosed compound and its intermediates may exist in different tautomeric forms. Tautomers include any structural isomers of different energies that have a low energy barrier to interconversion. One example is proton tautomers (prototropic tautomers.) In this example, the interconversions occur via the migration of a proton. Examples of prototropic tautomers include, but are not limited to keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. In another example illustrated graphically below, proton migration between the 1-position and 3-position nitrogen atoms of the benzimidazole ring may occur. As a result, Formulas Ia and Ib are tautomeric forms of each other: The invention further encompasses any other physiochemical or sterochemical form that the disclosed compound may assume. Such forms include diastereomers, racemates, isolated enantiomers, hydrated forms, solvated forms, or any other known or yet to be disclosed crystalline, polymorphic crystalline, or amorphous form. Amorphous forms lack a distinguishable crystal lattice and therefore lack an orderly arrangement of structural units. Many pharmaceutical compounds have amorphous forms. Methods of generating such chemical forms will be well known by one with skill in the art. In some aspects of the invention the disclosed compound is in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include any salt derived from an organic or inorganic acid. Examples of such salts include but are not limited to the following: salts of hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and sulphuric acid. Organic acid addition salts include, for example, salts of acetic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, benzoic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, citric acid, 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulphonic acid, ethanesulphonic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), fumaric acid, glucoheptonic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, N-glycolylarsanilic acid, 4-hexylresorcinol, hippuric acid, 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoicacid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoicacid, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic acid, lactobionic acid, n-dodecyl sulphuric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulphonic acid, methyl sulpuric acid, mucic acid, 2-naphthalenesulphonic acid, pamoic acid, pantothenic acid, phosphanilic acid ((4-aminophenyl) phosphonic acid), picric acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, tannic acid, tartaric acid, terephthalic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, 10-undecenoic acid or any other such acid now known or yet to be disclosed. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that such pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be used in the formulation of a pharmacological composition. Such salts may be prepared by reacting the disclosed compound with a suitable acid in a manner known by those skilled in the art. The invention further encompasses aspects in which a protecting group is added to the compound. One skilled in the art would recognize that during the synthesis of complex molecules, one group on the disclosed compound may happen to interfere with an intended reaction that includes a second group on the compound. Temporarily masking or protecting the first group encourages the desired reaction. Protection involves introducing a protecting group to a group to be protected, carrying out the desired reaction, and removing the protecting group Removal of the protecting group may be referred to as deprotection. Examples of compounds to be protected in some syntheses include hydroxy groups, amine groups, carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups and thiols. Many protective groups and reagents capable of introducing them into synthetic processes have been and are continuing to be developed today. A protecting group may result from any chemical synthesis that selectively attaches a group that is resistant to certain reagents to the chemical group to be protected without significant effects on any other chemical groups in the molecule, remains stable throughout the synthesis, and may be removed through conditions that do not adversely react with the protected group, nor any other chemical group in the molecule. Multiple protecting groups may be added throughout a synthesis and one skilled in the art would be able to develop a strategy for specific addition and removal of the protecting groups to and from the groups to be protected. Protecting groups, reagents that add those groups, preparations of those reagents, protection and deprotection strategies under a variety of conditions, including complex syntheses with mutually complementary protecting groups are all well known in the art. Nonlimiting examples of all of these may be found in Green et al, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry 2nd Ed., (Wiley 1991), and Harrison et al, Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8 (Wiley, 1971-1996) both of which hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Racemates, individual enantiomers, or diasteromers of the disclosed compound may be prepared by specific synthesis or resolution through any method now known or yet to be disclosed. For example, the disclosed compound may be resolved into it enantiomers by the formation of diasteromeric pairs through salt formation using an optically active acid. Enantiomers are fractionally crystallized and the free base regenerated. In another example, enantiomers may be separated by chromatography. Such chromatography may be any appropriate method now known or yet to be disclosed that is appropriate to separate enantiomers such as HPLC on a chiral column. The invention further encompasses pharmaceutical compositions that include the disclosed compound as an ingredient. Such pharmaceutical compositions may take any physical form necessary depending on a number of factors including the desired method of administration and the physicochemical and stereochemical form taken by the disclosed compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound. Such physical forms include a solid, liquid, gas, sol, gel, aerosol, or any other physical form now known or yet to be disclosed. The concept of a pharmaceutical composition including the disclosed compound also encompasses the disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof without any other additive. The physical form of the invention may affect the route of administration and one skilled in the art would know to choose a route of administration that takes into consideration both the physical form of the compound and the disorder to be treated. Pharmaceutical compositions that include the disclosed compound may be prepared using methodology well known in the pharmaceutical art. A pharmaceutical composition that includes the disclosed compound may include a second effective compound of a distinct chemical formula from the disclosed compound. This second effective compound may have the same or a similar molecular target as the target or it may act upstream or downstream of the molecular target of the disclosed compound with regard to one or more biochemical pathways. Pharmaceutical compositions including the disclosed compound include materials capable of modifying the physical form of a dosage unit. In one nonlimiting example, the composition includes a material that forms a coating that holds in the compound. Materials that may be used in such a coating, include, for example, sugar, shellac, gelatin, or any other inert coating agent. Pharmaceutical compositions including the disclosed compound may be prepared as a gas or aerosol. Aerosols encompass a variety of systems including colloids and pressurized packages. Delivery of a composition in this form may include propulsion of a pharmaceutical composition including the disclosed compound through use of liquefied gas or other compressed gas or by a suitable pump system.

Such forms include solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules including liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, directed release formulations, lyophylates, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, granules, powders, syrups, elixirs, or any other formulation now known or yet to be disclosed. Additional examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” by E. W. Martin, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, oral administration and parenteral administration. Parenteral administration includes, but is not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, sublingual, intramsal, intracerebral, iratraventricular, intrathecal, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topically to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. Other methods of administration include but are not limited to infusion techniques including infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings such as oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa. Compositions for parenteral administration may be enclosed in ampoule, a disposable syringe or a multiple-dose vial made of glass, plastic or other material. Administration may be systemic or local. Local administration is administration of the disclosed compound to the area in need of treatment. Examples include local infusion during surgery; topical application, by local injection; by a catheter; by a suppository; or by an implant. Administration may be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of a cancer, tumor, or precancerous tissue or into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration may be achieved by any of a number of methods known in the art. Examples include use of an inhaler or nebulizer, formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. The disclosed compound may be delivered in the context of a vesicle such as a liposome or any other natural or synthetic vesicle. A pharmaceutical composition formulated so as to be administered by injection may be prepared by dissolving the disclosed compound with water so as to form a solution. In addition, a surfactant may be added to facilitate the formation of a homogeneous solution or suspension. Surfactants include any complex capable of non-covalent interaction with the disclosed compound so as to facilitate dissolution or homogeneous suspension of the compound. Pharmaceutical compositions including the disclosed compound may be prepared in a form that facilitates topical or transdermal administration. Such preparations may be in the form of a solution, emulsion, ointment, gel base, transdermal patch or iontophoresis device. Examples of bases used in such compositions include opetrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols, beeswax, mineral oil, diluents such as water and alcohol, and emulsifiers and stabilizers, thickening agents, or any other suitable base now known or yet to be disclosed. Cancer cells include any cells derived from a tumor, neoplasm, cancer, precancer, cell line, or any other source of cells that are ultimately capable of potentially unlimited expansion and growth. Cancer cells may be derived from naturally occurring sources or may be artificially created. Cancer cells may also be capable of invasion into other tissues and metastasis when placed into an animal host. Cancer cells further encompass any malignant cells that have invaded other tissues and/or metastasized. One or more cancer cells in the context of an organism may also be called a cancer, tumor, neoplasm, growth, malignancy, or any other term used in the art to describe cells in a cancerous state. Expansion of a cancer cell includes any process that results in an increase in the number of individual cells derived from a cancer cell. Expansion of a cancer cell may result from mitotic division, proliferation, or any other form of expansion of a cancer cell, whether in vitro or in vivo. Exapansion of a cancer cell further encompasses invasion and metastasis. A cancer cell may be in physical proximity to cancer cells from the same clone or from different clones that may or may not be genetically identical to it. Such aggregations may take the form of a colony, tumor or metastasis, any of which may occur in vivo or in vitro. Slowing the expansion of the cancer cell may be brought about either by inhibiting cellular processes that promote expansion or by bringing about cellular processes that inhibit expansion. Processes that inhibit expansion include processes that slow mitotic division and processes that promote cell senescence or cell death. Examples of specific processes that inhibit expansion include caspase dependent and independent pathways, autophagy, necrosis, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dependent and independent processes and further include any such processes yet to be disclosed. Addition of a pharmaceutical composition to cancer cells includes all actions by which an effect of the pharmaceutical composition on the cancer cell is realized. The type of addition chosen will depend upon whether the cancer cells are in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro, the physical or chemical properties of the pharmaceutical composition, and the effect the composition is to have on the cancer cell. Nonlimiting examples of addition include addition of a solution including the pharmaceutical composition to tissue culture media in which in vitro cancer cells are growing; any method by which a pharmaceutical composition may be administered to an animal including intravenous, per os, parenteral, or any other of the methods of administration; or the activation or inhibition of cells that in turn have effects on the cancer cells such as immune cells (e.g. macophages and CD8+ T cells) or endothelial cells that may differentiate into blood vessel structures in the process of angiogenesis or vasculogenesis. Determination of an effective amount of the disclosed compound is within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. The effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition used to effect a particular purpose as well as its toxicity, excretion, and overall tolerance may be determined in cell cultures or experimental animals by pharmaceutical and toxicological procedures either known now by those skilled in the art or by any similar method yet to be disclosed. One example is the determination of the IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of the pharmaceutical composition in vitro in cell lines or target molecules. Another example is the determination of the LD50 (lethal dose causing death in 50% of the tested animals) of the pharmaceutical composition in experimental animals. The exact techniques used in determining an effective amount will depend on factors such as the type and physical/chemical properties of the pharmaceutical composition, the property being tested, and whether the test is to be performed in vitro or in vivo. The determination of an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition will be well known to one of skill in the art who will use data obtained from any tests in making that determination. Determination of an effective amount of disclosed compound for addition to a cancer cell also includes the determination of an effective therapeutic amount, including the formulation of an effective dose range for use in vivo, including in humans. Treatment is contemplated in living entities including but not limited to mammals (particularly humans) as well as other mammals of economic or social importance, including those of an endangered status. Further examples include livestock or other animals generally bred for human consumption and domesticated companion animals. The toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical composition may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or animals. Examples include the determination of the IC50 (the half maximal inhibitory concentration) and the LD50 (lethal dose causing death in 50% of the tested animals) for a subject compound. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The effective amount of the disclosed compound to results in the slowing of expansion of the cancer cells would preferably result in a concentration at or near the target tissue that is effective in slowing cellular exapansion in neoplastic cells, but have minimal effects on non-neoplastic cells, including non-neoplastic cells exposed to radiation or recognized chemotherapeutic chemical agents. Concentrations that produce these effects can be determined using, for example, apoptosis markers such as the apoptotic index and/or caspase activities either in vitro or in vivo. Treatment of a condition is the practice of any method, process, or procedure with the intent of halting, inhibiting, slowing or reversing the progression of a disease, disorder or condition, substantially ameliorating clinical symptoms of a disease disorder or condition, or substantially preventing the appearance of clinical symptoms of a disease, disorder or condition, up to and including returning the diseased entity to its condition prior to the development of the disease. The addition of a therapeutically effective amount of the disclosed compound encompasses any method of dosing of a compound. Dosing of the disclosed compound may include single or multiple administrations of any of a number of pharmaceutical compositions that include the disclosed compound as an active ingredient. Examples include a single administration of a slow release composition, a course of treatment involving several treatments on a regular or irregular basis, multiple administrations for a period of time until a diminution of the disease state is achieved, preventative treatments applied prior to the instigation of symptoms, or any other dosing regimen known in the art or yet to be disclosed that one skilled in the art would recognize as a potentially effective regimen. A final dosing regimen including the regularity of and mode of administration will be dependent on any of a number of factors including but not limited to the subject being treated; the severity of the affliction; the manner of administration, the stage of disease development, the presence of one or more other conditions such as pregnancy, infancy, or the presence of one or more additional diseases; or any other factor now known or yet to be disclosed that affects the choice of the mode of administration, the dose to be administered and the time period over which the dose is administered. Pharmaceutical compositions that include the disclosed compound may be administered prior to, concurrently with, or after administration of a second pharmaceutical composition that may or may not include the compound. If the compositions are administered concurrently, they are administered within one minute of each other. If not administered concurrently, the second pharmaceutical composition may be administered a period of one or more minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months before or after the pharmaceutical composition that includes the compound Alternatively, a combination of pharmaceutical compositions may be cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of one or more pharmaceutical compositions for a period of time, followed by the administration of one or more different pharmaceutical compositions for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration, in order to reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the compositions, to avoid or reduce the side effects of one or more of the compositions, and/or to improve the efficacy of the treatment. The invention further encompasses kits that facilitate the administration of the disclosed compound to a diseased entity. An example of such a kit includes one or more unit dosages of the compound. The unit dosage would be enclosed in a preferably sterile container and would be comprised of the disclosed compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another aspect, the unit dosage would comprise one or more lyophilates of the compound. In this aspect of the invention, the kit may include another preferably sterile container enclosing a solution capable of dissolving the lyophilate. However, such a solution need not be included in the kit and may be obtained separately from the lyophilate. In another aspect, the kit may include one or more devices used in administrating the unit dosages or a pharmaceutical composition to be used in combination with the compound. Examples of such devices include, but are not limited to, a syringe, a drip bag, a patch or an enema. In some aspects of the invention, the device comprises the container that encloses the unit dosage. Pharmaceutical compositions including the disclosed compound may be used in methods of treating cancer. Such methods involve the administration of a therapeutic amount of a pharmaceutical composition that includes the disclosed compound and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a mammal, preferably a mammal in which a cancer has been diagnosed. A therapeutic amount further includes the prevention of progression of the cancer to a neoplastic, malignant or metastatic state. Such preventative use is indicated in conditions known or suspected of preceding progression to neoplasia or cancer, in particular, where non-neoplastic cell growth consisting of hyperplasia, metaplasia, or most particularly, dysplasia has occurred (for review of such abnormal growth conditions, see Robbins and Angell, 1976, Basic Pathology, 2d Ed., W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, pp. 68-79). Hyperplasia is a form of controlled cell proliferation involving an increase in cell number in a tissue or organ, without significant alteration in structure or activity. For example, endometrial hyperplasia often precedes endometrial cancer and precancerous colon polyps often transform into cancerous lesions. Metaplasia is a form of controlled cell growth in which one type of adult or fully differentiated cell substitutes for another type of adult cell. Metaplasia can occur in epithelial or connective tissue cells. A typical metaplasia involves a somewhat disorderly metaplastic epithelium. Dysplasia is frequently a forerunner of cancer, and is found mainly in the epithelia; it is the most disorderly form of non-neoplastic cell growth, involving a loss in individual cell uniformity and in the architectural orientation of cells. Dysplastic cells often have abnormally large, deeply stained nuclei, and exhibit pleomorphism. Dysplasia characteristically occurs where there exists chronic irritation or inflammation, and is often found in the cervix, respiratory passages, oral cavity, and gall bladder. Alternatively or in addition to the presence of abnormal cell growth characterized as hyperplasia, metaplasia, or dysplasia, the presence of one or more characteristics of a transformed phenotype or of a malignant phenotype, displayed in vivo or displayed in vitro by a cell sample derived from a patient can indicate the desirability of prophylactic/therapeutic administration of the pharmaceutical composition that includes the compound. Such characteristics of a transformed phenotype include morphology changes, looser substratum attachment, loss of contact inhibition, loss of anchorage dependence, protease release, increased sugar transport, decreased serum requirement, expression of fetal antigens, disappearance of the 250,000 dalton cell surface protein, etc. (see also id., at pp. 84-90 for characteristics associated with a transformed or malignant phenotype). Further examples include leukoplakia, in which a benign-appearing hyperplastic or dysplastic lesion of the epithelium, or Bowen's disease, a carcinoma in situ, are pre-neoplastic lesions indicative of the desirability of prophylactic intervention. In another example, fibrocystic disease including cystic hyperplasia, mammary dysplasia, adenosis, or benign epithelial hyperplasia is indicates desirability of prophylactic intervention. In some aspects of the invention, use of the disclosed compound may be determined by one or more physical factors such as tumor size and grade or one or more molecular markers and/or expression signatures that indicate prognosis and the likely response to treatment with the compound. For example, determination of estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) steroid hormone receptor status has become a routine procedure in assessment of breast cancer patients. See, for example, Fitzgibbons et al, Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 124:966-78, 2000. Tumors that are hormone receptor positive are more likely to respond to hormone therapy and also typically grow less aggressively, thereby resulting in a better prognosis for patients with ER+/PR+ tumors. In a further example, overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor protein, has been correlated with poor breast cancer prognosis (see, e.g., Ross et al, The Oncologist 8:307-25, 2003), and Her-2 expression levels in breast tumors are used to predict response to the anti-Her-2 monoclonal antibody therapeutic trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.). In another aspect of the invention, the diseased entity exhibits one or more predisposing factors for malignancy that may be treated by administration of a pharmaceutical composition including the compound. Such predisposing factors include but are not limited to chromosomal translocations associated with a malignancy such as the Philadelphia chromosome for chronic myelogenous leukemia and t (14; 18) for follicular lymphoma; an incidence of polyposis or Gardner's syndrome that are indicative of colon cancer; benign monoclonal gammopathy which is indicative of multiple myeloma, kinship with persons who have had or currently have a cancer or precancerous disease, exposure to carcinogens, or any other predisposing factor that indicates in increased incidence of cancer now known or yet to be disclosed. The invention further encompasses methods of treating cancer that comprise combination therapies that comprise the administration of a pharmaceutical composition including the disclosed compound and another treatment modality. Such treatment modalities include but are not limited to, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, cancer vaccines, radioimmunotherapy, treatment with pharmaceutical compositions other than those which include the disclosed compound, or any other method that effectively treats cancer in combination with the disclosed compound now known or yet to be disclosed. Combination therapies may act synergistically. That is, the combination of the two therapies is more effective than either therapy administered alone. This results in a situation in which lower dosages of both treatment modality may be used effectively. This in turn reduces the toxicity and side effects, if any, associated with the administration either modality without a reduction in efficacy. In another aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition including the disclosed compound is administered in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of radiotherapy. The radiotherapy may be administered concurrently with, prior to, or following the administration of the pharmaceutical composition including the compound. The radiotherapy may act additively or synergistically with the pharmaceutical composition including the compound. This particular aspect of the invention would be most effective in cancers known to be responsive to radiotherapy. Cancers known to be responsive to radiotherapy include, but are not limited to, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, Ewing's sarcoma, testicular cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, larynx cancer, cervical cancer, nasopharynx cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, esophogeal cancer, rectal cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, other CNS neoplasms, or any other such tumor now known or yet to be disclosed. Examples of pharmaceutical compositions that may be used in combination with the disclosed compound may include nucleic acid binding compositions such as cis-diamminedichloro platinum (II) (cisplatin), doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, taxol, and topoisomerase inhibitors such as etoposide, teniposide, irinotecan and topotecan. Still other pharmaceutical compositions include antiemetic compositions such as metoclopromide, domperidone, prochlorperazine, promethazine, chlorpromazine, trimethobenzamide, ondansetron, granisetron, hydroxyzine, acethylleucine monoethanolamine, alizapride, azasetron, benzquinamide, bietanautine, bromopride, buclizine, clebopride, cyclizine, dimenhydrinate, diphenidol, dolasetron, meclizine, methallatal, metopimazine, nabilone, oxyperndyl, pipamazine, scopolamine, sulpiride, tetrahydrocannabinols, thiethylperazine, thioproperazine and tropisetron. Still other examples of pharmaceutical compositions that may be used in combination with the pharmaceutical composition including the disclosed compound are hematopoietic colony stimulating factors. Examples of hematopoietic colony stimulating factors include, but are not limited to, filgrastim, sargramostim, molgramostim and epoietin alfa. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition including the disclosed compound may be used in combination with an anxiolytic agent. Examples of anxiolytic agents include, but are not limited to, buspirone, and benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam, oxazapam, chlorazepate, clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. Pharmaceutical compositions that may be used in combination with pharmaceutical compositions that include the disclosed compound may include analgesic agents. Such agents may be opioid or non-opioid analgesic. Non-limiting examples of opioid analgesics inlcude morphine, heroin, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, oxycodone, metopon, apomorphine, normorphine, etorphine, buprenorphine, meperidine, lopermide, anileridine, ethoheptazine, piminidine, betaprodine, diphenoxylate, fentanil, sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, levorphanol, dextromethorphan, phenazocine, pentazocine, cyclazocine, methadone, isomethadone and propoxyphene.

In other aspects of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions including the disclosed compound may be used in combination with a method that involves treatment of cancer ex vivo. One example of such a treatment is an autologous stem cell transplant. In this method, a diseased entity's autologous hematopoietic stem cells are harvested and purged of all cancer cells. A therapeutic amount of a pharmaceutical composition including the disclosed compound may then be administered to the patient prior to restoring the entity's bone marrow by addition of either the patient's own or donor stem cells. Cancers that may be treated by pharmaceutical compositions including the disclosed compound either alone or in combination with another treatment modality include solid tumors such as fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, bone cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, oral cancer, nasal cancer, throat cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms'tumor, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, lung cancer, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, skin cancer, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma.

ID#23 The synthesis of the compounds begins with a 2-fluoronitrobenzene of formula 1 (Scheme 1). When R is an aromatic ring, the 2-fluoronitrobenzene of formula 1 can be prepared from the corresponding bromide of formula 8 through a Suzuki cross coupling reaction. An amine addition with R′NH2 9 generates a nitrobenzene of formula 2, which is reduced to form a dianiline of formula 3. N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) mediated cyclization of a dianiline of formula 3 with methyl 4-isothiocyanatobenzoate affords a methyl ester of formula 4. Treatment of a methyl ester of formula 4 with hydroxylamine and sodium hydroxide solution results in the formation of a hydroxamic acid of formula 5. Alternatively, hydrolysis of a methyl ester of formula 4 provides a carboxylic acid of formula 6. Subsequent amide formation reaction with tert-butyl 2-aminophenylcarbamate followed by removal of the protective group generates an amide of formula 7.

Example 24 Cell viability in the presence of varying concentrations of the above listed compounds at different time points was used to assess cytotoxicity and the effect of the compounds on cell proliferation. IC50 (or percent activity) data for the disclosed compounds in the SKOV3 and A2780 cell lines are summarized in Table 1. Cell Viability Assay— Cell viability was measured by the CellTiter-Blue® cell viability assay Promega (Madison, Wis.). This procedure measures the conversion of the indicator dye (resazurin) to resorufin, an indicator of cell viability. Following treatment, growth media was removed and cells were incubated with 20 μl of CellTiter-Blue® Reagent and growth media for 1-4 hours at 37° C. Fluorescence values were measured at 535/590 nm using a Beckman-Coulter DTX-880 microplate reader. Single Agent Studies— Cells were grown to 70% confluency, trypsinized, counted, and seeded in 96 well flat-bottom plates at a final concentration of 2.5×103-5×103 cells/well (Day 0). Cells were allowed to incubate in growth media for 24 hours to allow for maximum adhesion. Treatment with the test agents or standard agents began on Day 1 and continued for 72 hours. At the 72 hour timepoint, treatment containing media was removed. Viable cell numbers are quantified by the CellTiter-Blue® cell viability assay as described above. Experiments were repeated at least twice with the same concentrations to determine growth inhibitory activity. Results from these studies were used to calculate an IC50 value (concentration of drug that inhibits cell growth by 50 percent of control) for each compound. Data Collection— For single agent and combination studies, data from each experiment was collected and expressed as % Cell Growth using the following calculation: [in-line-formulae]% Cell Growth=(ftest/fvehicle)×100[/in-line-formulae] Where ftest is the fluorescence of the tested sample, and fvehicle is the fluorescence of the vehicle in which the drug is dissolved. Dose response graphs and IC50 values were generated using Prism 4 software (GraphPad) using the following equation: Y = ( Top - Bottom ) ( 1 + 10 ( ( lo ⁢ ⁢ gIC ⁢ ⁢ 50 - X ) - HillSlope ) ) Where X is the logarithm of concentration and Y is the response. Y starts at the Bottom and goes to Top with a sigmoid shape. Further, the in vivo efficacy studies of compound ID#4 in A2780 xenograft models is shown in FIG. 1. In vivo efficacy of the disclosed compound was tested through a human ovarian tumor xenograft model. Female Ncr nude mice were inoculated with 1×107 A2780 human ovarian cells suspended in a mixture of 50% Matrigel and 50% tissue culture media in a total volume of 100 μl. Four days following inoculation, the mice were pair-matched into four groups of 7-8 mice per group at an average tumor weight of 157 mg per group. Group 1 (G1) was treated with vehicle only daily for 14 days. Group 3 (G3) was treated with Compound ID #4 (T062) at 100 mg/kg daily for 14 days. Group 5 (G5) was treated with Doxil at 3 mg/kg on Day 1 only. Group 6 (G6) was treated with Compound ID #4 (T062) at 50 mg/kg (daily for 14 days) plus Doxil at 3 mg/kg on Day 1 only. Group 7 (G7) was treated with Compound ID #4 (T062) at 100 mg/kg (daily for 14 days) plus Doxil at 3 mg/kg on Day 1 only. Vehicle and Compound ID #4 were administered orally via oral gavage while Doxil was administered intravenously via tail injection. Body weights and tumor measurements were collected twice weekly. Tumor width and length were measured in millimeters and converted to tumor weight (in milligrams) using the formula (width2×Length/2)=tumor weight (mg.). Group 6 and Group 7 showed improved efficacy over Group 5 with Doxil as a single agent (See FIG. 1).
