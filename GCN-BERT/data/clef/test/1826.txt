Example 10
Synthesis of Compound (10, M18)
Compound 10 was synthesized using a three-step method. First, malic acid (3.00 g, 22.37 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (K2CO3, 7.42 g, 53.70 mmol), combined in a round bottom flask and 25 mL anhydrous DMF added under argon. Benzyl bromide (BnBr, 7.97 mL, 67.12 mmol) was then added and the reaction heated to 45° C. After stirring overnight, excess DMF was removed using a rotary evaporator and the resulting white paste dissolved in 200 mL 1:1 ethyl acteate:saturated aquoues NaHCO3. The organic layer was washed 3×100 mL sat. aq. NaHCO3, dried over Na2SO4, isolated via vacuum filtration and concentration in vacuo. The resulting oil was redissolved in acetonitrile (100 mL) and washed 3×50 mL hexanes. The acetonitrile layer was then concentrated in vacuo to acquire pure dibenzyl malate (DBM). Yield: 6.33 g 90% (clear oil).
