FIELD OF INVENTION This invention provides oral compositions comprising a protein, an absorption enhancer, and a protease inhibitor and a method for administering same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Due to improved biotechnology, the accessibility of biologically active peptides to the pharmaceutical industry has increased considerably. However, a limiting factor in the development of peptide drugs is the relative ineffectiveness when given perorally. Almost all peptide drugs are parenterally administered, although parenterally administered peptide drugs are often connected with low patient compliance. Insulin is a medicament used to treat patients suffering from diabetes, and is the only treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by a pathological condition of absolute or relative insulin deficiency, leading to hyperglycemia, and is one of the main threats to human health in the 21st century. The global figure of people with diabetes is set to rise to 220 million in 2010, and 300 million in 2025. Type I diabetes is caused primarily by the failure of the pancreas to produce insulin. Type II diabetes, involves a lack of responsiveness of the body to the action of insulin. Approximately 20%-30% of all diabetics use daily insulin injections to maintain their glucose levels. An estimated 10% of all diabetics are totally dependent on insulin injections. Currently, the only route of insulin administration is injection. Daily injection of insulin is causes considerable suffering for patients. Side effects such as lipodystrophy at the site of the injection, lipatrophy, lilpohypertrophy, and occasional hypoglycemia are known to occur. In addition, subcutaneous administration of insulin does not typically provide the fine continuous regulation of metabolism that occurs normally with insulin secreted from the pancreas directly into the liver via the portal vein. The present invention addresses the need for an alternate solution for administration of insulin and peptides such as insulin. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides, in one embodiment, a composition comprising a protein having a molecular weight of up to 100,000 Daltons, a protease inhibitor, and an absorption enhancer, wherein the absorption enhancer enhances the absorption of a protein through an intestinal mucosal barrier. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a composition comprising a protein having a molecular weight of up to 100,000 Daltons, a protease inhibitor, and SNAC or SNAD. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for oral administration of a protein having a molecular weight up to 100,000 Daltons to a subject, whereby a substantial fraction of said protein retains its activity after absorption, through an intestinal mucosal barrier of a subject, comprising administering orally to a subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a protein, a protease inhibitor, and an absorption enhancer, wherein an absorption enhancer enhances the absorption of a protein through an intestinal mucosal barrier. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating diabetes mellitus in a subject, comprising administering orally to a subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising insulin, Exenatide, or a combination thereof a protease inhibitor, and a absorption enhancer, wherein an absorption enhancer enhances the absorption of a protein through an intestinal mucosal barrier, thereby treating diabetes mellitus.

In one embodiment, methods and compositions of the present invention have the advantage of more closely mimicking physiological insulin secretion by the pancreas. When insulin is secreted into the portal vein, the liver is exposed to a greater insulin concentration than peripheral tissues. Similarly, insulin administered according to the present invention reaches the intestine and is absorbed in the body through the intestine and through the portal system to the liver. This absorption route thus resembles the physiological secretion of insulin by the pancreas, enabling, in this embodiment, delicate control of the blood glucose level and the metabolic activities of the liver and the peripheral organs controlled by insulin. By contrast, when insulin is administered to insulin-deficient diabetic patients via the peripheral venous system, the concentration of insulin in the portal vein is similar to that in the peripheral circulation, resulting in hypoinsulinemia in the portal vein and the liver and hyperinsulinemia in the peripheral venous system. This leads, in one embodiment, to an abnormal pattern of glucose disposal. In another embodiment, different constituents of compositions of the present composition are absorbed at different rates from the intestinal lumen into the blood stream. The absorption of the bile acid, in one embodiment, is significantly faster than the absorption of insulin. For this reason, in another embodiment, a drug regimen involving ingestion of a pair of pills at spaced intervals, e.g., a second pill containing a higher concentration of enhancer is taken at a defined interval (e.g. 30 minutes) after the first pill. In another embodiment, certain of the constituents are microencapsulated to enhance the absorption of the insulin into the system. In another embodiment, certain of the constituents are microencapsulated to enhance the absorption of the Exenatide into the system. In one embodiment, a treatment protocol of the present invention is therapeutic. In another embodiment, the protocol is prophylactic. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. In another embodiment, solid carriers/diluents for use in methods and compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, a gum, a starch (e.g. corn starch, pregeletanized starch), a sugar (e.g., lactose, mannitol, sucrose, dextrose), a cellulosic material (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose), an acrylate (e.g. polymethylacrylate), calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, talc, or mixtures thereof. In another embodiment, the compositions further comprise binders (e.g. acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, carbomer, ethyl cellulose, guar gum, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, povidone), disintegrating agents (e.g. cornstarch, potato starch, alginic acid, silicon dioxide, croscarmelose sodium, crospovidone, guar gum, sodium starch glycolate), buffers (e.g., Tris-HCl., acetate, phosphate) of various pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces, detergents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Pluronic F68, bile acid salts), surfactants (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate), permeation enhancers, solubilizing agents (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycerol), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, butylated hydroxyanisole), stabilizers (e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hyroxypropylmethyl cellulose), viscosity increasing agents(e.g. carbomer, colloidal silicon dioxide, ethyl cellulose, guar gum), sweeteners (e.g. aspartame, citric acid), preservatives (e.g., Thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), lubricants (e.g. stearic acid, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate), flow-aids (e.g. colloidal silicon dioxide), plasticizers (e.g. diethyl phthalate, triethyl citrate), emulsifiers (e.g. carbomer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate), polymer coatings (e.g., poloxamers or poloxamines), coating and film forming agents (e.g. ethyl cellulose, acrylates, polymethacrylates) and/or adjuvants.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS SECTION Example 1 Insulin, SNAC, and Protease Inhibitors Oral Formulations Materials and Experimental Methods Formulation Formulations were prepared containing: (1) 6 mg insulin, 250 mg SNAC, 125 mg SBTI, (2) 6 mg insulin, 2.5 mg Aprotinin, 125 mg SBTI, (3) 6 mg insulin, 250 mg SNAC, 2.5 mg Aprotinin, 125 mg SBTI, (4) 6 mg insulin, 250 mg SNAC. The formulations were stored in the refrigerator (4ยฐ C.) until dosing. Results In the next experiment, the formulations as describes in the โFormulationโ section were orally consumed by 3 healthy human subjects. As shown in FIG. 1, blood glucose levels were significantly reduced and more stable in human subjects treated with formulations (1) and (3). These results suggest that formulations comprising a combination of a protease inhibitor and SNAC are superior to formulations comprising only SNAC. Specifically, the combination of SNAC and SBTI is superior to any other formulation used. It is important to notice that the effect of SNAG and a protease inhibitor is synergistic because formulations consisting insulin and a single protease inhibitor do not have a blood glucose lowering effect- no differences in the reduction of blood glucose levels were observed in previous experiment with the same formulations comprising a single protease inhibitor (SBTI or Aprotinin). Thus, the results regarding the reduction in blood glucose levels with insulin and a combination of SNAC and at least one protease inhibitor was unexpected. The formulation comprising SNAC and SBTI had a synergistic, utmost effect in lowering blood glucose levels As shown in FIG. 2, blood C-peptide levels were significantly reduced in human subjects treated with formulation (1) and (3). These results also suggest that the combination of SNAC and a protease inhibitor such as SBTI had a synergistic effect in lowering blood C-peptide levels. It should be emphasized that no reduction of C-peptide levels were observed in a previous experiment wherein formulations comprising a single protease inhibitor (SBTI or Aprotinin) were used. Thus, the results regarding the reduction in blood C-peptide levels with insulin and a combination of a protease inhibitor such as SBTI and SNAG was unexpected.
