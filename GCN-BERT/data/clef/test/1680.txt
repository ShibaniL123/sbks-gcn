RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/970,492, filed on Sep. 6, 2007, the content of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to primers and probes for detection of toxin-producing (toxigenic) strains of Clostridium difficile, and to methods of detecting toxigenic strains using these primers and probes. More specifically, the invention relates to detection of C. difficile by nucleic acid-based amplification methods using particular primers and probes that bind to the toxin B (TedB) gene. These primers and probes are used to amplify difficile nucleic acids in clinical samples to determine the presence of these toxigenic strains. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, gram-positive bacillus that produces exotoxins that are pathogenic to humans. C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) ranges in severity from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis and death. C. difficile typically has affected older or severely ill patients who are hospital inpatients or residents of long-term-care facilities. C. difficile is the major cause of pseudomembranous colitis and antibiotic associated diarrhea. C. difficile-associated disease occurs when the normal intestinal flora is altered, allowing C. difficile to flourish in the intestinal tract and produce a toxin that causes a watery diarrhea. One major cause for alteration of intestinal flora is the overuse of antibiotics. Repeated enemas, prolonged nasogastric tube insertion and gastrointestinal tract surgery also increase a person's risk of developing the disease. The overuse of antibiotics, especially penicillin (ampicillin), clindamycin and cephalosporins may also alter the normal intestinal flora and increase the risk of developing C. difficile diarrhea. Toxigenic strains of C. difficile commonly produce two large toxins, an enterotoxin; toxin A (TcdA) and a cytotoxin; toxin B (TcdB), to which disease symptoms are attributed. They are expressed efficiently during growth of C. difficile in response to an environmental stimulus. Their activities modulate numerous physiological events in the cell and contribute directly to disease. In humans the two toxins cause diseases called pseudomenbranous colitis and antibiotic associated diarrhea. Transmission occurs primarily in health care facilities, where exposure to antimicrobial drugs and environmental contamination by C. difficile spores are common (2, 3 and 4). Toxin A and toxin B are encoded by genes tcdA and tcdB. Both have been sequenced and are found in single open reading frames. Together with three additional genes (tcdC, tdcD, tcdE), they form a 19.6 kb chromosomal pathogenicity locus (Paloc) (8). Both open reading frames are large, with tcdA spanning 8,133 nucleotides and tcdB being 7,098 nucleotides in length. FIG. 1 shows the genetic arrangement of the C. difficile Paloc. tedD, renamed tcdR (Rupnik, M. et al., J. Med. Microbiol, 2005, 54: 113-117) is a proposed positive regulator, tcdE is a putative holin protein, and tcdC is a proposed negative regulator of toxin gene expression (Voth, D. E. et al., Clinical Microbiol. Reviews, 2005, 18: 247-263). TcdA and TcdB are among the largest bacterial toxins reported, comparable in size to lethal toxin (TcsL) and hemorrhagic toxin (TcsH) of C. sordellii as well as alpha toxin (Tens) of C. novyi (Voth, supra.). TcdA (308 kDa) and TcdB (270 kDa) are glucosyltransferases which inactivate small GTPases such as Rho, Rac and Cdc-42 within target cells (Voth, supra.). This inactivation causes disagreggation of the cellular cytoskeleton and alterations of other cellular processes which eventually lead to cell death (Voth, supra.). Both toxins use a highly conserved N-terminal domain (74% homology between TcdA and TcdB) to modify identical substrates. The proximal locations of tcdA and tcdB genes and the high sequence and functional homology between the two proteins inspired Von Eichel-Streiber to propose that the two genes may have arisen as the result of gene duplication (Knoop F. C. et al, Clin. Micro reviews, July 1993, 251-265). TcdB also exhibits homology (85% homology and 74% identity) with lethal toxin (TscL) of C. sordellii, which glycosylates Ras, Rac, Rap and Ral. The major differences are found in the N terminus. These explain the differences in substrate specificity. TedA is thought to be more similar in function to the hemorrhagic toxin (TcsH) of C. sordellii (Voth, supra.). In early studies, it had been generally accepted that C. difficile toxigenic strains produced both toxin A and toxin B whereas nontoxigenic strains lacked both toxins (Rupnik et al. supra.; Lyerly et al., Clin. Micro. Rev., 1998, Jan., 1-18). Toxin variant strains were then discovered which failed to produce detectable toxin A, and yet produced toxin B (TcdA−/TcdB+). A third toxin (binary toxin CDT) has also been found in some C. difficile strains. Although the majority of binary toxin positive strains produce TcdA and TcdB (TcdA+TcdB+CDT+) some produce neither TcdA nor TcdB (TcdA−TcdB−CDT+). In the light of available data, C. difficile strains into toxigenic strains were classified as toxigenic if they produced at least one of the three known toxins, and nontoxigenic strains if they did not produce any of these three toxins (Rupnik et al., supra.). While the primary work on TcdA and TcdB was carried out on toxins from the toxigenic reference strain VP1 10463, several genetic variants of these toxins now exist in clinical isolates (Voth et al., supra.). Two well-characterized strains which do not express toxin A (TcdA−/TcdB+), 1470 and 8864, produce modified toxin B compared to VP1 10463. Strain 1470 produces a hybrid of toxins TcdB and TcsL. The strain produces TcdB-like cell contact and a TcsL-like enzymatic domain (morphological change and cell death like TcsL) (Voth, supra.; Chaves-Olarte E. et al, The Journal of biological chemistry, 1999, 274, no16, 11046-11052). As mentioned above, toxin B from reference strain 10463 inactivated small GTPases as Rho, Rae and Cdc-42. The impact is visible on electron microscopy with a modification of cellular aspect. Two types of cytopathic effects are described. The D-type is characterized by an arborized appearance of the cells whereas a spindle-like appearance is typical of the second type of cytopathic effect, the S-type (Mehlig, et al., FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 2001, 198:171-176). Toxin B of reference strain show D-type cytopathic effect as well as toxin A. Strains with lack of toxin A production, such as strain 1470 and strain 8864, produce toxin B with S-type cytopathic effect. Substrates for these toxins B are small GTPases Ras, Rac, Rap, Ral and Cdc-42. Both strains show variations in their toxin B gene (tcdB) compared to VP1 14063 tcdB gene. These variations explain the differences in substrate specificity. A difference in the N-terminal region of the tcdB of 1470 strain and VP1 10463 has been well documented (Von Eichel-Streiber et al, Mol Microbiol, 1995, 17: 313-321). Another toxin B variant strain was discovered that produces functional toxin A. Thus, strain C34 is the first C. difficile strain that expresses a variant toxin B as 1470 and 8864, and a functional toxin A as reference type strain 14063 (Mehlig et al., supra). This strain produces a toxin B with S-type cytopathic effect such as strain 1470 and 8864. C34 is the first C. difficile isolate coexpressing a D-type-inducing TcdA with an S-type-inducing TcdB molecule. The substrates of TcdA−C34 and the reference strain TcdA−10463 are identical (Rho, Rae and Cdc-42), and the substrates of TcdB-C34 and TcdA-1470 or 8864 are identical (Ras, Rae, Rap, Ral and Cdc-42). The tcdB sequence from C34 differs only in nucleotides from tcdB-1470 or 8864. Instead of having a deletion in tcdA that prevents toxin A production as strains 1470 and 8864, there is an inserted sequence in tcdA-C34. This small insertion does not have a negative effect on toxin A production. Nevertheless, in this strain, the S-type cytopathic effect on cells dominates over the D-type cytopathic effect (Mehlig et al., supra.). To date, one variant strain has been described that produces a generally intact tcdB but a non-functional toxin B lacking a cytotoxic effect, and a functional toxin A having a cytotoxic effect. Toxinotyping data of this variant showed limited mutation in the Paloc and classified this strain in toxinotype IX (TcdA−/TcdB+/CDT+) (abstract, Maccannell et al, 2006). Recently, outbreaks of hypertoxigenic C. difficile strains have been reported in Canada and the United States. These isolates were positive for CDT binary toxin, had a deletion in the tcdC gene and produced greater amounts of toxins A and B (McDonald et al, New Engl. J. Med., December 2005, 353, no 23). The emergence of similar C. difficile isolates in the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands has also been described. The epidemic strain isolated in those countries was characterized as toxinotype III, North American PGEF 1 (NAP1), restriction endonuclease analysis group type B1 and PCR ribotype 027 (Kuijper E et al, document for European Centre for Disease prevention and Control, Emergence of Clostridium difficile-associated disease in Canada, the United State of America and Europe). For C. difficile toxigenic strains, nucleotide sequence variations, deletions and duplications in the Paloc (tcdB and tcdA region) account for various types. A typing system has been developed which distinguishes the various types and classifies them as toxinotypes (1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19). Toxinotyping involves detection of polymorphisms in the pathogenicity locus (Paloc) precisely in the tcdA and tcdB genes. There are now at least 24 toxinotypes (See Table 1). Strains in which the Paloc is identical to the reference strain VP1 10463 are referred as toxinotype 0. Not all variations of toxin genes affect toxin production. Strains of toxinotypes I-VII, IX, XII-XV and XVIII-XXIV produce both toxins A and B despite variations in their toxin genes (8, 11, 13, 19). Strains of toxinotype XI do not produce toxin A or B (13) whereas strains of toxinotypes VIII, X, XVI and XVII produce a functional toxin B but no toxin A (13). FIG. 2 describes well the relation between toxinotype and toxin expression. Strain 1470 belongs to toxinotype VIII and strain 8864 to toxinotype X. Most of the TcdA−/TcdB+ strains are known to belong to toxinotype VIII and produce a variant toxin B like strain 1470 while toxinotype X contains only strain 8864 (11).

The consensus sequence for the tcdB gene was determined using 6 available sequences in GenBank (See Appendix I). The first sequence in the tcdB alignment (SEQ ID NO: 1) is the reference strain VP1 14063 TcdA+/TcdB+. The second and third sequences in Appendix I (SEQ ID NOS 2 and 3, respectively) are two well-characterized TcdA−/TcdB+ strains (1470, second line and strain 8864, third line). The fourth line is another TcdA−/TcdB+ strain (5340) (SEQ ID NO: 4). The variant toxB and functional toxA strain C34 cluster 1-2 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 5) is shown in the fifth line, and the C. sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) sequence (SEQ ID NO: 6) is shown in the sixth line as a specificity control. Certain regions of the tcdB gene are conserved among these different strains. A positive culture for C. difficile without a toxin assay is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of C. difficile-associated disease. Thus, toxigenic C. difficile detection by a tissue culture cytotoxin assay is often considered the “gold standard.” However, this assay is time consuming, as it implies an incubation period of at least 24 h. The present invention provides a real-time PCR assay targeting the C. difficile toxin gene tcdB that is rapid, sensitive, and specific, and allows detection of C. difficile directly from clinical samples, such stool samples. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides primers and probes for detection of toxin-producing (toxigenic) strains of C. difficile. These primers and probes are shown in Tables 2-4, and methods of detecting toxigenic strains of C. difficile using these probes and primers. One embodiment of the present invention is an oligonucleotide probe or primer up to about 100 nucleobases in length which is capable of hybridizing to a C. difficile toxin B (TcdB) gene, wherein said probe or primer comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1-33, or a sequence that exhibits at least about 85% identity to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 1-33. In one embodiment, the probe or primer has a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1-33, or a sequence that exhibits at least about 85% identity to a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 1-33. In another embodiment, the probe or primer has a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 1-33. The present invention also provides a method for detecting the presence of a toxigenic strains of C. difficile in a biological sample, comprising contacting the sample with at least one pair of primers capable of binding to a C. difficile toxin B (TcdB) gene, in which each primer in the at least one pair of primers is up to about 100 nucleobases in length, and is capable of binding to a C. difficile toxin B (TcdB) gene, and in which each primer in the at least one pair of primers comprises a sequence shown in SEQ ID NOS: 1-33, or a sequence that exhibits at least about 85% identity to a sequence shown in SEQ ID NOS: 1-33; amplifying target nucleic acid from the sample; and detecting the presence or amount of an amplified product(s) as an indication of the presence of the toxigenic strain of C. difficile in said sample. In one embodiment, the sample is a stool, sputum, peripheral blood, plasma, serum, lymph node, respiratory tissue or exudate sample. In another embodiment, the sample is contacted with one pair of primers. In yet another embodiment, the amplifying is carried out with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), strand displacement amplification (SDA), replicase-mediated amplification or transcription-mediated amplification. Preferably, the amplifying is carried out using PCR. Types of PCR include AFLP, Alu-PCR, Asymmetric PCR Colony PCR, DD-PCR, Degenerate PCR, Hot-start PCR, In situ PCR, Inverse PCR Long-PCR, Multiplex PCR, Nested PCR, PCR-ELISA, PCR-RFLP, PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), quantitative competitive PCR (QC-PCR), rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR (RACE-PCR), Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR), Real-Time PCR, Repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (Rep-PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), TAIL-PCR, Touchdown PCR and Vectorette PCR. In one embodiment, the PCT is quantitative real-time PCT (QRT-PCR). In another embodiment, each primer introduces exogenous nucleotide sequence which allows post-amplification manipulation of amplification products without a significant effect on amplification itself. In certain embodiments, the primer pair comprises SEQ ID NOS: 30 and 31 or 31 and 32. In one embodiment, each primer in the primer pair is flanked by complementary sequences comprising a fluorophore at the 5′ end, and a fluorescence quencher at the 3′ end.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention relates to the detection of toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile using particular primers and probes that bind to the toxin B (TcdB) gene of C. difficile. These primers and probes are used to amplify C. difficile nucleic acids in clinical samples to determine the presence of toxogenic strains. As used herein, “template” refers to all or part of a polynucleotide containing at least one target nucleotide sequence. As used herein, a “target nucleotide sequence” includes the nucleotide sequence of the final product having defined sequence and length, and may include other nucleotide sequences that are removed during post-amplification processing of the amplification product. Nucleotide sequences that are found in the target nucleotide sequence and later removed may include binding sites (annealing sites) for primers or probes, nucleotides involved in conversion of double-stranded DNA to single-stranded DNA, or sequences useful as recognition and/or cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases. An “exogenous nucleotide sequence” as used herein, refers to a sequence introduced by primers or probes used for amplification, such that amplification products will contain exogenous nucleotide sequence and target nucleotide sequence in an arrangement not found in the original template from which the target nucleotide sequence was copied. The template may be any polynucleotide suitable for amplification, where the template contains at least one target nucleotide sequence to be amplified. Suitable templates include DNA and RNA molecules, and may include polynucleotides having modified bases, Preferably, templates are genomic DNA, cDNA, or RNA molecules. In another preferred embodiment, methods disclosed herein can be used to amplify RNA templates directly, without reverse-transcribing the RNA template into cDNA. By “clinical sample” is meant any tissue or material derived which may contain C. difficile nucleic acid, including, for example, stools (liquid or soft), sputum, peripheral blood, plasma, serum, biopsy tissue including lymph nodes, respiratory tissue or exudates, or other body fluids, tissues or materials. The sample may be treated to physically, chemically and/or mechanically disrupt tissue or cell structure, thus releasing intracellular components. Sample preparation may use a solution that contains buffers, salts, detergents and the like which are used to prepare the sample for analysis. By “nucleic acid” is meant a polymeric compound comprising nucleosides or nucleoside analogs which have nitrogenous heterocyclic bases, or base analogs, linked together by nucleic acid backbone linkages (e.g., phosphodiester bonds) to form a polynucleotide. Conventional RNA and DNA are included in the term “nucleic acid” as are analogs thereof. The nucleic acid backbone may include a variety of linkages, for example, one or more of sugar-phosphodiester linkages, peptide-nucleic acid bonds, phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate linkages or mixtures of such linkages in a single oligonucleotide. Sugar moieties in the nucleic acid may be either ribose or deoxyribose, or similar compounds with known substitutions. Conventional nitrogenous bases (A, G, C, T, U), known base analogs (e.g., inosine), derivatives of purine or pyrimidine bases and “abasic” residues (i.e., no nitrogenous base for one or more backbone positions) are included in the term nucleic acid. That is, a nucleic acid may comprise only conventional sugars, bases and linkages found in RNA and DNA, or may include both conventional components and substitutions (e.g., conventional bases and analogs linked via a methoxy backbone, or conventional bases and one or more base analogs linked via an RNA or DNA backbone). “Primer” means an oligonucleotide sequence that is designed to hybridize with a complementary portion of a target sequence, a probe, or a ligation product, and undergo primer extension. A primer functions as the starting point for the polymerization of nucleotides (Concise Dictionary of Biomedicine and Molecular Biology, (1996) CPL Scientific Publishing Services, CRC Press, Newbury, UK). A primer generally contains about sixteen to twenty-four nucleotides, but may contain up to about 50, 75 or 100 nucleotides. Primers can hybridize to a DNA strand with the coding sequence of a target sequence and are designated sense primers. Primers can also hybridize to a DNA strand that is the complement of the coding sequence of a target sequence; such primers are designated anti-sense primers. Primers that hybridize to each strand of DNA in the same location or to one another are known as complements of one another. Primers can also be designed to hybridize to a mRNA sequence complementary to a target DNA sequence and are useful in reverse transcriptase PCR. The term “primer extension” means the process of elongating a primer that is annealed to a target in the 5′ to 3′ direction using a template-dependent polymerase. According to certain embodiments, with appropriate buffers, salts, pH, temperature, and nucleotide triphosphates, including analogs and derivatives thereof, a template dependent polymerase incorporates nucleotides complementary to the template strand starting at the 3′-end of an annealed primer, to generate a complementary strand. By “probe” is meant a nucleic acid oligomer that hybridizes specifically to a target sequence in a nucleic acid, under conditions that allow hybridization, thereby allowing detection of the target or amplified nucleic acid. The probe's “target” generally refers to a sequence within or a subset of an amplified nucleic acid sequence which hybridizes specifically to at least a portion of a probe oligomer by standard hydrogen bonding (i.e., base pairing). A probe may comprise target-specific sequences and other sequences that contribute to three-dimensional conformation of the probe. Sequences are “sufficiently complementary” if they allow stable hybridization in appropriate hybridization conditions of a probe oligomer to a target sequence that is not completely complementary to the probe's target-specific sequence. By “sufficiently complementary” is meant a contiguous nucleic acid base sequence that is capable of hybridizing to another base sequence by hydrogen bonding between a series of complementary bases. Complementary base sequences may be complementary at each position in the oligomer sequence by using standard base pairing (e.g., G:C, A:T or A:U) or may contain one or more residues that are not complementary (including abasic positions), but in which the entire complementary base sequence is capable of specifically hybridizing with another base sequence in appropriate hybridization conditions. Contiguous bases are preferably at least about 80%, more preferably at least about 90%, and most preferably 100% complementary to a sequence to which an oligomer is intended to hybridize. Those skilled in the art can readily choose appropriate hybridization conditions which can be predicted based on base sequence composition, or be determined by using routine testing (e.g., see Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2.sup.nd ed. (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). The terms “duplex” means an intermolecular or intramolecular double-stranded portion of a nucleic acid which is base-paired through Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen, or other sequence-specific interactions of nucleobases. A duplex may consist of a primer and a template strand, or a probe and a target strand. A “hybrid” means a duplex, triplex, or other base-paired complex of nucleic acids interacting by base-specific interactions, e.g. hydrogen bonds. The term “anneal” as used herein refer to the base-pairing interaction of one polynucleotide with another polynucleotide that results in the formation of a duplex or other higher-ordered structure. The primary interaction is base specific, i.e., A/T and G/C, by Watson/Crick and Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonding. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, primers and/or probes are utilized to permit amplification of a C. difficile nucleic acid template containing a tcdB-derived target nucleotide sequence and to optionally introduce additional features into the amplification products. Each primer and/or probe contains a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a region of target nucleotide sequence in the template, in order for each primer to bind (anneal) to the template. In one embodiment, at least one primer contains exogenous nucleotide sequence 5′ (upstream) of the primer sequence complementary to the primer-binding target nucleotide sequence, with the result that each amplification product contains exogenous nucleotide sequence introduced by the primer. Primers and/or probes having up to about 100 nucleotides comprising any of the primer and/or probe sequences described herein, and the use of these primers to detect the presence of the C. difficile TcdB gene in clinical samples using nucleic acid amplification-based methods (e.g., PCR), are also within the scope of the present invention. In addition, primers and/or probes that exhibit about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% nucleic acid identity to any of the specific primers and/or probes described herein, and the use of these primers to detect the presence of the C. difficile TcdB gene in clinical samples using nucleic acid amplification-based methods, are also contemplated, as are primers and/or probes having up to about 100 nucleotides comprising any of these homologous sequences. In another embodiment, two primers are used, where each primer introduces exogenous nucleotide sequence that allow post-amplification manipulation of amplification products without a significant effect on amplification itself. Alternately, more than two primers are used, where each primer introduces exogenous nucleotide sequence that allow post-amplification manipulation of amplification products without a significant effect on amplification itself. Primers for a particular embodiment may be designed by one of skill in the art according to well-known principles, for example as disclosed in Dieffenbach and Dveksler (“General Concepts For PCR Primer Design” in, PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual, Dieffenbach and Dveksler, eds.) Nucleic acid amplification refers to any known procedure for obtaining multiple copies of a target nucleic acid sequence or its complement or fragments thereof, using sequence-specific methods. Known amplification methods include, for example, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR), Strand Displacement Amplification (SDA), replicase-mediated amplification and transcription-mediated amplification. PCR refers to a method well-known in the art for amplification of nucleic acid. PCR involves amplification of a target sequence using two or more extendable sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers that flank the target sequence. The nucleic acid containing the target sequence of interest is subjected to a precise program of multiple rounds of thermal cycling (denaturation, annealing and extension) in the presence of the primers, a thermostable DNA polymerase (e.g., Taq polymerase) and the four dNTPs, resulting in amplification of the target sequence. PCR uses multiple rounds of primer extension reactions in which complementary strands of a defined region of a DNA molecule are simultaneously synthesized by a thermostable DNA polymerase. At the end of each cycle, each newly synthesized DNA molecule acts as a template for the next cycle. During repeated rounds of these reactions, the number of newly synthesized DNA strands increases exponentially such that after 20 to 30 reaction cycles, the initial template DNA will have been replicated several thousand-fold or million-fold. Methods for carrying out different types and modes of PCR are thoroughly described in the literature, for example in “PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual” Dieffenbach and Dveksler, eds. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1995, and by Mullis et al. in patents (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202 and 4,800,159) and scientific publications (e.g. Mullis et al. 1987, Methods in Enzymology, 155:335-350) where the contents of each reference are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. PCR generates double-stranded amplification products suitable for post-amplification processing. If desired, amplification products can be detected by visualization with agarose gel electrophoresis, by an enzyme immunoassay format using probe-based colorimetric detection, by fluorescence emission technology, or by other detection means known to one of skill in the art. Methods for a wide variety of PCR applications are widely known in the art, and are described in many sources, for example, Ausubel et al. (eds.), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Section 15, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1994). Variations of PCR include AFLP, Alu-PCR, Asymmetric PCR Colony PCR, DD-PCR, Degenerate PCR, Hot-start PCR, In situ PCR, Inverse PCR Long-PCR, Multiplex PCR, Nested PCR, PCR-ELISA, PCR-RFLP, PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), quantitative competitive PCR (QC-PCR), rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR (RACE-PCR), Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR), Real-Time PCR, Repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (Rep-PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), TAIL-PCR, Touchdown PCR and Vectorette PCR. These techniques are described, for example, at www.perlinks.com. Real-time polymerase chain reaction, also called quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), is used to simultaneously quantify and amplify a specific part of a given DNA molecule. It is used to determine whether a specific sequence is present in the sample; and if it is present, the number of copies of the sequence that are present. The term “real-time” refers to periodic monitoring during PCR. Certain systems such as the ABI 7700 and 7900HT Sequence Detection Systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) conduct monitoring during each thermal cycle at a pre-determined or user-defined point. Real-time analysis of PCR with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes measures fluorescent dye signal changes from cycle-to-cycle, preferably minus any internal control signals. The real-time procedure follows the general pattern of PCR, but the DNA is quantified after each round of amplification. Two common methods of quantification are the use of fluorescent dyes (e.g., Sybr Green) that intercalate into double-stranded DNA, and modified DNA oligonucleotide probes that fluoresce when hybridized with a complementary DNA. LCR amplification uses at least four separate oligonucleotides to amplify a target and its complementary strand by using multiple cycles of hybridization, ligation, and denaturation (EP Patent No. 0 320 308). SDA amplifies by using a primer that contains a recognition site for a restriction endonuclease which nicks one strand of a hemimodified DNA duplex that includes the target sequence, followed by amplification in a series of primer extension and strand displacement steps (U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,252 to Walker et al.). In strand displacement amplification, a double-stranded DNA target is denatured and hybridized with two primers, or the primers invade the DNA helix. The two primers contain an internal sequence for enzyme nicks to be placed in the newly formed DNA helix. The thermal stable DNA polymerase lacking a 5′->3′ exonuclease activity, extends both primers. Generation of single stranded nicks creates new DNA extension sites and the hybridization of the first primer creates additional DNA extension sites for exponential DNA amplification. Certain Embodiments of the invention include the following primers and probes (either RNA or DNA), that bind to the TcdB gene of C. difficile. Design and Molecular Characterization of Probes and Primers The design of primers and probes in any PCR diagnostic assay is always a compromise between sensitivity and specificity, and involves consideration of rapidity and hybridization temperature. The shortest amplicon is generally designed in order to maximize its accumulation and reduce the cycling time. The temperature difference between the melting temperature of the primers and the molecular beacon probe (defined below) is generally as high as possible. This can be achieved by varying the length and GC content of beacon stems. Such optimization of primers and probes requires a certain amount of theoretical data, obtained from database analysis and computations on nucleic acid sequences. A brief summary of relevant data is provided below. Primers were designed using sequence databases and the software Oligo™ (version 6.0; National Biosciences). Primer design was based on melting temperature, GC content, the length of the amplicon, the ability to form as few hairpin structures as possible, their ability to form as few inter-secondary structures as possible with another primer molecule of the same sequence (homodimers), their ability to form as few inter-secondary structures as possible with other primers and probes (heterodimers), and their specificity for the toxB DNA gene sequence. Tm and GC % calculations were done using the Integrated DNA Technology (IDT) OligoAnalyzer 3.0 program, available on the IDT website (http://scitools.idtdna.com/Analyzer/oligocalc.asp). Parameters used were 0.25 μM for all primers, 100 mM Na+ and DNA as target. To allow an overview of the primers of the BD GeneOhm™ Cdiff assay, the primers used to amplify the target are described in Table 2.

Their characteristics are shown in Table 3. This simplex allows the amplification of the target. This primer set was chosen because both have similar GC contents and melting temperatures (Tm). Furthermore, the amplicon generated with these primers is 257 bp long for the toxin B gene target, which is suitable for a real-time PCR assay using molecular beacon probes. The primers KERLA-tcdB-2873 and KENP-tcdB-3102 also serve as primers for the internal control pDIFFa. TABLE 3 Amplicon Tm Length GC size Primer Sequence (° C.)

The loop contains a probe sequence that is complementary to a target sequence, and the stem is formed by the annealing of complementary arm sequences that are located on either side of the probe sequence. A fluorophore is covalently linked to the end of one arm and a quencher is covalently linked to the end of the other arm. Molecular beacons do not fluoresce when they are free in solution. However, when they hybridize to a nucleic acid strand containing a target sequence they undergo a conformational change that enables them to fluoresce brightly. In the absence of targets, the probe is dark, because the stem places the fluorophore so close to the nonfluorescent quencher that they transiently share electrons, eliminating the ability of the fluorophore to fluoresce. When the probe encounters a target molecule, it forms a probe-target hybrid that is longer and more, stable than the stem hybrid. The rigidity and length of the probe-target hybrid precludes the simultaneous existence of the stem hybrid. Consequently, the molecular beacon undergoes a spontaneous conformational reorganization that forces the stem hybrid to dissociate and the fluorophore and the quencher to move away from each other, restoring fluorescence. Molecular beacons can be used as amplicon detector probes in diagnostic assays. Because nonhybridized molecular beacons are dark, it is not necessary to isolate the probe-target hybrids to determine the number of amplicons synthesized during an assay. Molecular beacons are added to the assay mixture before carrying out gene amplification and fluorescence is measured in real time. The assay tube remains sealed. Consequently, the amplicons cannot escape to contaminate untested samples. Furthermore, the use of molecular beacons provides an additional level of specificity. Because it is very unlikely that false amplicons or primer-dimers possess target sequences for the molecular beacons, the generation of fluorescence is exclusively due to the synthesis of the intended amplicons. Molecular Beacon Design Molecular beacons were designed to target the tcdB sequence and the internal control pDIFFa Using sequence databases and the software Oligo™ (version 6.0; National Biosciences). The different criteria taken into consideration when selecting molecular beacon probes are summarized below Contain conserved sequence only from species to detect (or from species characteristics to detect), and shows the required specificity.Probe length ˜20 to 30 nucleotides.Probe does not hybridize on parts of the amplified target showing secondary structures.Required Tm according to the assay.GC content of 60% to 80%Only one structure (hairpin loop) at both synthesis and annealing temperatures.Delta G at annealing temperature <0.No mismatches between probe and appropriate target.Temperature difference between the Tm of the primers and the molecular beacon as high as possible.Sequence alignments do not demonstrate cross reactivity between probes nor between probes and primers. Molecular Beacons NK-toxB-B34-A0 and Sign-B4-B0 (Table 4) were chosen because their characteristics correspond to the best compromise between all established theoretical criteria. The Sign-B4-B0 probe hybridizes with the forward strand of the internal control amplicons, while NK-toxB-B34-A0 hybridizes with the reverse strand of the C. difficile toxin B gene. For detection of toxin B gene amplicons, the molecular beacon NK-toxB-B34-A0 bears the fluorophore 5′-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at its 5′ end and the nonfluorescent quencher moiety dabcyl chloride (DABCYL) at its 3′ end. For detection of the IC amplicons, the molecular beacon Sign-B4-B0 includes the fluorophore tetrachlorofluorescein (TET) at its 5′ end, and the nonfluorescent quencher moiety DABCYL at its 3′ end. The NK-toxB-B34-A0 probe provides the positive signal in the assay and Sign-B4-B0 determines the validity of the PCR reaction in the assay. Their characteristics are shown in Table 4.

Some nucleotides from the hybridizing sequence can also be part of the stem sequence and are thus underlined. Formation of Hairpin Structures The proper design of an assay also involves the verification of potential problems for the amplification reaction. The amplification efficiency can be greatly affected by secondary structures and mismatches between primers, probes and their respective targets. To prevent such occurrences, the ability of all primers to form hairpin structures was evaluated with IDT OligoAnalyzer 3.0 software available on IDT's website. Parameters used were 0.25 μM of each primer, 100 mM Na+, 5.5 mM MgCl2, target DNA, hybridization temperature of 57° C. Since the hybridization depends on the thermodynamic characteristics of the molecules involved, secondary structures or undesired matches can thus be predicted and avoided. In addition, in all reactions in a PCR assay occurring in solution, the Gibbs free energy (noted AG and expressed in kcal/mol) is predictive of whether or not a match is likely to occur. AG negative values are indicative of the formation of a proposed structure or match, whereas positive values of ΔG indicate that a proposed structure is thermodynamically unstable and a match is unlikely to occur. Two hairpin structures can be formed with primer KERLA-tcdB-2873 (ΔG=0.86 and 0.89 kcal/mol), and two hairpin structures can be formed with primer KENP-tcdB-3012 (ΔG=1.9 and 2.35 kcal/mol). These structures are all thermodynamically unstable (positive ΔG). The NK-toxB-B34-A0 target probe and Sign-B4-B0 internal control probe molecule each has an oligonucleotide probe sequence flanked on each side by complementary sequences (arms), carrying a fluorophore at its 5′ end and a fluorescence quencher at its 3′ end. In a closed conformation, the arms form a stem and the probe sequence is located in a hairpin loop (FIGS. 2a and 2b). In this conformation the fluorescence is quenched. However, when hybridizing with the target DNA, the hairpin structure unfolds and allows fluorescence. For each probe, structure was determined at two temperatures using The Bioinformatics Center at Rensselaer and Wadsworth tools (DNA folding in applications section); this web server uses mfold (version3.1) by Zuker and Turner (Zuker, Nucleic Acids Res. 31 (13), 3406-15, 2003). First, the probe structure at the synthesis temperature and salt conditions was determined (10 mM Na+ and 20° C. without Mg2+) and then the structure at the annealing temperature and salt conditions of the PCR assay was determined (100 mM Na+, 57° C. and 5.5 mM Mg2+). Only one structure was obtained for target probe as well as for IC probe (synthesis conditions and PCR conditions (see FIGS. 2a and 2b)). No stable probe dimer was identified. The ability of all primers and probes to form self dimers (homodimers) or duplexes with another primer or probes of the assay (heterodimers) was evaluated with the IDT OligoAnalyzer 3.0 software available on IDT's website. Parameters used for the analysis were 0.25 μM of each primer, 100 mM Na+ and DNA as target. Homoduplexes of primers involving less than 7 consecutive base pairs corresponding to 25% of the total sequence (28 bp length) are very unlikely to form. Two structures formed with KERLA-tcdB-2873 involve 6 consecutive bases corresponding to 21% of the size of the primer. This is not enough to generate a stable duplex (Table 5). With KENP-tcdB-3102, hybridizations could occur with only 4 consecutive base pairs (14%). With probes, 17% and 22% of the total sequence of Sign-B4-B0 (7/41 bp) and NK-toxB-B34-A0 (7/32 bp), respectively, could be used to form homoduplexes. This is not sufficient to create stable structures. In the same way, heteroduplexes involving a number of consecutive nucleotides lower than 25% of the shortest sequence size are very unlikely to form (Table 5). Consequently, all the structures able to be formed will be unstable and 18% is the greatest percentage met.

Thus, the potential hybridization of the primers with non-C. difficile sequences was tested. Sequences homologous to each assay primer were identified using BLAST searches (version 2.2.15) from the GenBank databases. The likelihood of amplifying non-target sequences was then evaluated according to the following criteria: the hybridization of each primer pair on different strands or the hybridization of one given primer at two sites on the same targetthe number of nucleotides complementary to the target sequence. Namely, the last 2 nucleotides of primers 3′ end should hybridize to the target to allow primer extension.the length of the DNA fragment generated by the primer pair. Fragments above 3 kb are well outside rapid PCR and molecular beacon detection technology's limits. Results of these searches are summarized in Table 6. For both primers, only Toxin B gene sequence from C. difficile strains showed 100% identity with primer sequences.

Positive results were obtained for all toxinotypes, but not for any related species, C. sordelli, C. difficile A-/B-strain or non-toxigenic C. difficile strain. Thus, the probes are specific to toxigenic strains of C. difficile. Real-time PCR was performed under standard conditions using C. difficile DNA obtained from liquid or soft human stool samples using the primers shown in Table 3. The real-time PCR assay was performed as described below. Real-Time PCR Assay Lyophilized reagents were reconstituted with 225 μl diluent to provide the following buffer used for the real-time PCR assay: 116 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 11.6 mM KCl, 3.48 mM MgCl2, 5.8 mM NH2SO4, and subsequently divided into 25 μl aliquots. 0.5, 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 copies of C. difficile template DNA was added to each of 5 replicate reactions. The PCR assay was run in a SMART CYCLER™ PCR machine under the following conditions: 60° C. for 6 sec, followed by 95° C. for 900 sec, followed by 45 cycles of 95° C. for 5 seconds, 63° C. for 10 sec and 72° C. for 20 sec.
