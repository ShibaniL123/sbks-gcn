1.8: 5-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 1)
19 mg (0.01 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and 265 mg (1.7 mmol) of 2,3-difluorophenylboronic acid are added to a solution of 160 mg (0.3 mmol) of 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione and 0.5 ml (1 mmol) of 2M aqueous solution of potassium carbonate in 12 ml of dimethylformamide and 2 ml of water, previously degassed with nitrogen. The reaction mixture is heated at 90° C. for 2 hours. The reaction mixture is treated by adding water and then the product is extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water and then with a saturated solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue obtained is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a dichloromethane/methanol 95/5 mixture. 60 mg (36%) of 5-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 170° C.
