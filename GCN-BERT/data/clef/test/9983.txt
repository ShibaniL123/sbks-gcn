Intermediate 3
5-Chloroacetyloxidole (2.00 g, 9.54 mmol) and thiourea (0.76 g, 10.02 mmol) were suspended in anhydrous ethanol (15 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120° C. for 35 min. The mixture diluted with tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) and neutralized with 1N aq. NaOH solution and then extracted with ethyl acetate (2×200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give 5-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)indolin-2-one (2.36 g, 92%) as a light brown solid.
