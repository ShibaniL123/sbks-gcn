FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel tricarbocyanine-cyclodextrin(s) conjugates, and use thereof as diagnostic agents for kidney diseases. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fructans are used as markers in kidney diagnostics and in particular to determine the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as a test for kidney function. Fructans are straight or branched chain oligosaccharides and polysaccharides with an sucrose terminal end. Fructans can have different physical properties, such as water solubility depending on the degree of branching and polymerization. Fructans occur in plants as carbohydrate reserves. As a natural product the fructans have an unpredictable length. The fructans inulin and sinistrin are used in particular as markers in kidney function tests. Inulin and sinistrin are composed of 10 to 40 fructose units with a corresponding molecular weight of 1600 to 6500 Da. After intravenous injection, inulin and sinistrin are neither changed nor stored in the organism, but they are filtered out by the kidney glomeruli and are not reabsorbed again in the tubuli. The filtration of the fructans may vary according to their size. In order to assess kidney function, it is usual to determine the time variation of the concentration of the marker in the blood after intravenous injection of said marker. To do so, blood samples have to be drawn. The concentration marker in the blood may, for example, be determined by enzymatic methods, as described in Kuehnle et al., Nephron, 62, 104-107 (1992). This method is time consuming, very cumbersome and of limited use. A simpler alternative, based on fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled inulin (FITC-inulin) was described (M. Sohtell et al., Acta Physiol. Scand 119, 313-316 (1983); J. N. Lorenz and E. Gruenstein, Am. J. Physiol. (Renal Physiol. 45) 276, F172-F177 (1999). With this approach, also, blood is sampled and the fluorescein label of the FITC-Inulin is determined in the plasma. A very serious problem with this approach is that hemolysis, occurring during blood sampling, affects the determination of the concentration. Moreover, hemoglobin absorbs the excitation light at 480 nm very well, so less light is emitted and the apparent concentration is lower than in reality. A disadvantage of inulin and FITC-inulin for the clinical routine analyses is their very low solubility in water. Hence the preparations containing insulin and FITC-insulin have to be heated to 90° C. until complete dissolution (Rieg, T. A High-throughput Method for Measurement of Glomerular Filtration Rate in Conscious Mice. J. Vis. Exp. (75), e50330, doi:10.3791/50330 (2013)), as their aqueous solutions tend to crystallize during storage. Unfortunately, this causes a partial degradation of inulin to fructose. Furthermore, the solution has to be then dialysed for 24 hr at room temperature. This step is especially important to FITC-inulin in order to remove unconjugated FITC, but also the byproducts generated by the heating procedure. Dialysis substantially decreases the concentration of FITC-inulin. In addition, the low solubility of inulin and FITC-inulin makes it difficult to achieve a well defined concentration and to handle the marker during the injection. Recently, a Cy5.5-inulin conjugate has been introduced by Perkin-Elmer (GFR-Vivo; application note by Peterson, J. D, Perkin-Elmer Corporation). An advantage of Cy5.5-inulin conjugate over FITC-inulin is related to the excitation/emission wavelengths of Cy5.5 (675/705 nm). The longer wavelength of Cy5.5 allows a deeper tissue penetration, but its use with a small animal imager requires the animals being anesthetized. Anesthesia, however, has an unpredictable impact on blood pressure (initial rise, decrease during the major phase of anesthesia, followed by a rise at the ending phase). Kidney perfusion and thus GFR are highly sensitive to blood pressure, with low blood pressure values resulting in low GFR values. Thus, a meaningful/reproducible GFR measurement is not possible under anesthesia. A substantial improvement over the previous art was the introduction of a FITC-sinistrin conjugate as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,995,019. This marker is much more water soluble than FITC-inulin and, in addition, no undesired circulatory reactions have been observed when using FITC-sinistrin. Furthermore its concentration change over time can be measured transcutaneously. There is, however, still the problem of the penetration depth into the skin at a given wave length (480 nm allow a depth of only a few mm) and thus the dosage of the marker has to be fairly high to obtain a clear (measurement) signal. Another problem of the transcutaneous measurement is skin pigmentation, as melanin in the skin absorbs light quite efficiently at 480 nm. A major disadvantage of inulin and also sinistrin is that they are natural products; their composition is quite variable even within the same batch, and even more in different batches. For Regulatory Affairs this is not acceptable.

The invention relates to fluorescent tricarbocyanine-cyclodextrin(s) conjugates as markers for kidney function tests. These fluorescent conjugates, that are the object of the present invention, are represented by the general formula (I) [in-line-formulae]F-Ln-CDn (I)[/in-line-formulae] wherein F is a tricarbocyanine residue of formula (II) wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from H, SO3H, CO2H, SO2NH2, CH2COOH, NH2, NHCOCH2I, NO2, Br, Cl, CH3; R3 and R4 are independently selected from C1-4 alkyl, (CH2)3C≡CH, (CH2)4C≡CH (CH2)5COOH, (CH2)3SO3H, (CH2)4SO3H, (CH2)3NH2, (CH2)4NH2, (CH2)3N+(CH3)3, (CH2)5N+(CH3)3, (CH2)3N3, (CH2)4N3, (CH2)3NHCOCH2I, (CH2)4NHCOCH2I; (CH2CH2O)2CH3, (CH2CH2O)3CH3 (CH2CH2O)4CH3; R5, is H, Cl, or wherein X is selected from NH, O, S; j is an integer from 1 to 4; k is an integer from 1 to 4; CD is a cyclodextrin residue of formula (III) wherein m is and integer equal to 6, 7 or 8, R′, R″, R′″ are independently selected from OH, OCH3, OCH2CH3, OCH2CHOHCH3, OCHOHCH3, OCH2COOH, O(CH2)4SO3H, N3, NH2, NHCOCH3, OCH2C≡CH, SH; L is a linker group resulting from the coupling of the tricarbocyanine of formula (II) to the cyclodextrin(s) of formula (III) according to the following Table 1: Functional group of Functional group the tricarbocyanine of the cyclodextrin (F) in any (CD) in any of the groups of the groups R3, R4 or R5 R′, R″ or R′′′ Linker group (L) COOH OH —C(O)O— COOH NH2 —C(O)NH— NCS OH —NC(S)O— NCS NH2 —NC(S)NH— NH2 COOH —NHC(O)— NHCOCH2I SH NHC(O)CH2S— C≡CH N3 N3 C≡CH dichlorotriazine OH dichlorotriazine OH, OH dichlorotriazine OH, NH2 n is an integer from 1 to 4, and salts thereof. Dyes belonging to the class of cyanines have already found some use in clinical diagnostics; in particular, Indocyanine Green has been used for kidney function test and fluorescence angiography for more than 30 years. Tricarbocyanine dyes absorb and emit light in the near-infrared region (NIR) (650-900 nm). Tricarbocyanine dyes are especially suitable for in vivo imaging, diagnostics and even therapeutics, since biological tissues are relatively poor absorbers in the near-infrared spectral region, and infrared light can penetrate deeply in such tissues; in addition, these dyes do not give origin (or at very low amount) to auto-fluorescence in the near-infrared spectral region. Cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by the enzymatic degradation of starch. Depending on reaction conditions, three main CDs can be obtained α, β and γ; they consist of 6, 7 or 8 glucopyranose units. They are shaped as a truncated cone, with hydroxyl groups on each side. Their cavity is constituted by the glucosidal moieties. These three dimensional structures result in a high external hydrophilicity and internal hydrophobicity. In one embodiment, CDs are selected from β- and γ-cyclodextrins, that is, CD in which m parameter of formula (III) has a value about of 7 (β-cyclodextrin) or 8 (γ-cyclodextrin), respectively. While the water solubility of natural CDs is limited, chemical substitution at the 2-, 3- and 6-hydroxyl sites (i.e., when R′, R″ and R′″ are OH) greatly increases solubility. Most of cyclodextrins modified in this way, are able to achieve a 50% (w/v) concentration in water. In one embodiment, at least one of the groups R′, R″, R′″ of formula (III) is selected from OCH3, OCH2CH3, OCH2CHOHCH3, provided that at least one group R′, R″, R′″ is OH. In a preferred embodiment, R′ and R″ are OH, R′″ is selected from OCH3, OCH2CH3, OCH2CHOHCH3, preferably is OCH2CHOHCH3, in which the substitution degree of R′″ is between 0.5 and 1.5 per unit of formula (III). It is known to the skilled technician that the substitution of the groups R′, R″, R′″ of a cyclodextrin molecule, for example with groups OCH3, OCH2CH3, OCH2CHOHCH3, is partial, i.e. it that takes place only in some of the m structures of formula (III) constituting the cyclodextrin with a substitution degree between 0.5 and 1.5 substituents per unit of formula (III); in other words, some groups R′, R″, R′″ in some of the m structures of formula (III) are not replaced, or are OH groups, and are the ones predominantly, though not exclusively, involved in the conjugation with tricarbocyanine molecules of formula (II). In a further preferred embodiment, cyclodextrins of formula (III) are selected from 2-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrins (HCD), and in particular 2-hydroxypropyl-3-cyclodextrin (HβCD, whose chemical structure is shown in FIG. 2, and 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HγCD). HβCD and HγCD have been found to be non-toxic in mice and rabbits [Pitha, J. “Amorphous water soluble derivatives of cyclodextrins: non toxic dissolution enhancing excipients.” J. Pharm. Sci. 1985, 74, 987]. HβCD and HγCD are widely used to improve the water solubility of drugs. HβCD and HγCD represent advantageous substitutes of fructans, such as inulin and sinistrin, as components of fluorescent markers for the determination of GFR, as they are relatively inexpensive, non-toxic, structurally well-defined, synthetic products, with a strong solubilizing power. In an embodiment, the conjugate of formula (I) presents from 1 to 4 linker groups L to allow conjugation of 1 to 4 cyclodextrin molecules to one tricarbocyanine molecule. In a preferred embodiment, R1 and R2 groups are independently selected from H, SO3H, CO2H. In a preferred embodiment, R3 and R4 groups are independently selected from methyl, ethyl, (CH2)5COOH, (CH2)4SO3H, (CH2)3N+(CH3)3. In a preferred embodiment, R5 group is selected from H, Cl, or In a preferred embodiment, the linker group L is selected from an ester, an ether, an amide, a thiocarbamate, a thiourea, a thioether, a 1,2,3-triazole, or In a preferred embodiment, the fluorescent tricarbocyanine-cyclodextrin conjugate is a compound of formula (IV): wherein CD is 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HβCD) or 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HγCD) and the linker L of Formula (I) (corresponding to the value of the n parameter of formula (I) equal to 1) is an ester bond formed in the coupling reaction of the carboxyl group of the tricarbocyanine (corresponding to carboxyl group of R5 group= with a residue group R′″═OH of CD.

In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of at least one fluorescent compound of formula (I) or a diagnostic formulation comprising at least one fluorescent compound of formula (I) in kidney diagnostics, preferably in measuring the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), in a mammal. In an embodiment, the mammal is a mouse, a rat, a guinea pig, a cat, a dog, a sheep, a goat, a pig, a cow, a horse, a primate. In a still further embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a method of diagnosing the glomerular filtration rate of a mammal, preferably the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), wherein at least one compound of formula (I) or a diagnostic formulation comprising at last a compound of formula (I) is administered to a mammal and the fluorescent signal emitted from the dye of compound of formula (I) is detected and measured. Preferably, the at least one compound of formula (I) or the diagnostic formulation comprising at least one compound of formula (I) is administered to the mammal via a parenteral route. The diagnostic method herein disclosed is non-invasive, because the detection and measurement of the fluorescence emitted from the at least one compound of formula (I) are realized by detecting and measuring the fluorescent emission emerging from the skin of the mammal in response to excitation with a red light or near infrared light source, preferably by means of a sensor device placed onto the mammal skin. The method is accomplished in a clinically relevant period of time. That is, that period of time is such to allow the absorption of the compound of formula (I) in the blood of the mammal and the following secretion by the kidney system. In a further embodiment, a compound of formula (I) can be used for screening pharmaceutical compounds (test agents) suitable for treatment of chronic kidney diseases. The screening method comprises: i) administering to an animal model of chronic kidney diseases the test agent and at least one fluorescent compound of formula (I), wherein the fluorescent compound is administered subsequently to test agent; ii) measuring the glomerular filtration rate by detecting and measuring the fluorescence emission of the at least one fluorescent compound, wherein the detection and the measurement of the fluorescence comprises the detection and the measurement of the fluorescent emission emerging from the skin of the animal model in response to excitation with a red light or near infrared light source; iii) selecting the test agent that increases glomerular filtration rate. Mammalian models of chronic kidney diseases in, for example, mice, rats, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, sheep, goats, pigs, cows, horses, and primates, may be created by causing an appropriate direct or indirect injury to the kidney tissue of the animal. Animal models of acute kidney failure may, for example, be created by inducing in the animal the conditions or diseases such as acute interstitial nephritis or acute tubular necrosis, for example by the controlled administration of nephrotoxic agents (e.g., antibiotics, aminoglycoside drugs, heavy metals). Other mammalian models of chronic kidney disease are disclosed in Vukicevic, et al. (1987), J. Bone Mineral Res. 2:533; and EP-B-0 914 146; animal models have been described in detail in a handbook Experimental and genetic rat models of chronic renal failure, Gretz, N.; Strauch, M.; Karger (Basel and New York); 1993; pp 343; (ISBN 3805554990). Rat models of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease have been described in Gretz N, Kränzlin B, Pey R, Schieren G, Bach J, Obermüller N, Ceccherini I, Klöting I, Rohmeiss P, Bachmann S, Hafner M. Nephrol Dial Transplant. 1996; 11 Suppl 6:46-51. Review; murine models of polycystic kidney disease have been described in Schieren G, Pey R, Bach J, Hafner M, Gretz N. Nephrol Dial Transplant. 1996; 11 Suppl 6:38-45. Review. The following examples are intended to illustrate particular aspects of the present invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope thereof as defined by the claims. The following examples provide a detailed description of the synthesis of the tricarbocyanine named 2-((E)-2-((E)-2-((4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl)amino)-3-((E)-2-(3,3-dimethyl-5-sulfonate-1-(3-trimethylammonium)propyl)indolin-2-ylidene)ethylidene)cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)vinyl)-3,3-dimethyl-1-(3-(trimethylammonium)propyl)-3H-indol-1-ium-5-sulfonate bromide (named ABZWCY), its conjugation to a cyclodextrin molecule and its use in a diagnostic method for determining GFR in a rat. A fluorescent tricarbocyanine dye ABZWCY (4) was synthesized and linked to HβCD, according to Example 1 and Reaction Schemes 1-4. The resulting ABZWCY-HβCD conjugate exhibited excellent water solubility with concentrations reaching more than 100 mg/mL. In addition it showed a low plasma protein binding (PPB), i.e. less than 10%, which is a lower value than 125I-iothalamate, one of the golden standard agent for the GFR measurement [Levey, A. S. et al. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1993 4(5), 1159-1177]. The noninvasive real-time monitoring of plasma clearance resulted in a half-life of approximately 17±2 min. Moreover, the tricarbocyanine-cyclodextrin marker did not exhibit significant differences in plasma clearance half time in the absence and presence of a compound able to inhibit tubular secretion. This means that kidney tubular secretion is not a significant elimination pathway for these markers in a mammal. The present marker was exclusively cleared by the kidneys, with no appreciable nonspecific background signal in all the tissues and organs and only fluorescence signal remaining in the bladder 2 h post injection. In conclusion, such a fluorescent compound is highly suitable as exogenous fluorescent tracer for monitoring GFR. Example 1 Preparation of ABZWCY-HβCD a) Preparation of 2,3,3-Trimethyl-1-[3-(trimethylammonium)propyl]-3H-indolinium sulfonate bromide (1) The reaction was carried out according to Scheme 1.
