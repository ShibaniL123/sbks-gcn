TITLE BLUE LUMINESCENT COMPOUND AND DIASTEREOMERS THEREOF BACKGROUND INFORMATION Field of the Disclosure This disclosure relates in general to compositions of diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers of blue luminescent compounds and their use in electronic devices. Description of the Related Art Organic electronic devices that emit light, such as light-emitting diodes that make up displays, are present in many different kinds of electronic equipment. In all such devices, an organic active layer is sandwiched between two electrical contact layers. At least one of the electrical contact layers is light-transmitting so that light can pass through the electrical contact layer. The organic active layer emits light through the light-transmitting electrical contact layer upon application of electricity across the electrical contact layers. It is well known to use organic electroluminescent compounds as the active component in light-emitting diodes. Simple organic molecules, such as anthracene, thiadiazole derivatives, and coumarin derivatives are known to show electroluminescence. Metal complexes, particularly iridium and platinum complexes are also known to show electroluminescence. In some cases these small molecule compounds are present as a dopant in a host material to improve processing and/or electronic properties. There is a continuing need for new luminescent compounds.

After reading this specification, skilled artisans appreciate that other aspects and embodiments are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. Other features and benefits of any one or more of the embodiments will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims. The detailed description first addresses Definitions and Clarification of Terms followed by Diastereomers of Formula I, Composition Having Formula I, Synthesis, Devices, and finally Examples. 1 . Definitions and Clarification of Terms Before addressing details of embodiments described below, some terms are defined or clarified. The term "alkyl" is intended to mean a group derived from an aliphatic hydrocarbon and includes a linear, a branched, or a cyclic group. In some embodiments, an alkyl has from 1 -20 carbon atoms. The term "aromatic compound" is intended to mean an organic compound comprising at least one unsaturated cyclic group having delocalized pi electrons. The term "aryl" is intended to mean a group derived from an aromatic hydrocarbon having one point of attachment. The term includes groups which have a single ring and those which have multiple rings which can be joined by a single bond or fused together. The term is intended to include both hydrocarbon aryls, having only carbon in the ring structure, and heteroaryls. The term "alkylaryl" is intended to mean an aryl group having one or more alkyl substituents. In some embodiments, a hydrocarbon aryl has 6-60 ring carbons. In some embodiments, a heteroaryl has 3-60 ring carbons. The term "charge transport," when referring to a layer, material, member, or structure is intended to mean such layer, material, member, or structure facilitates migration of such charge through the thickness of such layer, material, member, or structure with relative efficiency and small loss of charge. Hole transport materials facilitate positive charge; electron transport materials facilitate negative charge. Although light-emitting materials may also have some charge transport properties, the term "charge transport layer, material, member, or structure" is not intended to include a layer, material, member, or structure whose primary function is light emission. The term "chiral" refers to a compound or group which is not superimposable on its mirror image. A compound that is chiral is usually obtained as a mixture of two "enantiomers" as defined below. The term "atropisomer" refers to a specific kind of chiral compound that is chiral as the result of hindered internal bond rotation. Atropisomerism is reviewed in the following reference: Bringmann, G.; Price Mortimer, A. J.; Keller, P. A.; Gresser, M. J.; Garner, J.; Breuning, M. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2005, 44, 5384. A compound that has a chiral center as the result of atropisomerism will normally be obtained as a mixture of two enantiomers. These two enantiomers are denoted by the descriptors "M" and "P" according to rules described in the aforementioned reference by Bringmann et al. The term "deuterated" is intended to mean that at least one hydrogen has been replaced by deuterium, abbreviated herein as "D". The term "deuterated analog" refers to a structural analog of a compound or group in which one or more available hydrogens have been replaced with deuterium. In a deuterated compound or deuterated analog, the deuterium is present in at least 100 times the natural abundance level. The term "diastereomers" and "diastereomeric" refers to stereoisomers that are not enantiomers. Diastereomerism occurs when two or more stereoisomers of a compound have different configurations at one or more (but not all) of the equivalent related stereocenters and are not mirror images of each other. The term "diastereomeric pair of enantiomers" as it relates to a compound having at least four stereoisomers, refers to a set of two stereoisomers, where the stereoisomers in the set are mirror images and where the set is not a mirror image of any other sets of two stereoisomers. The term "dopant" is intended to mean a material, within a layer including a host material, that changes the electronic characteristic(s) or the targeted wavelength(s) of radiation emission, reception, or filtering of the layer compared to the electronic characteristic(s) or the wavelength(s) of radiation emission, reception, or filtering of the layer in the absence of such material. The term "enantiomers" is intended to mean stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other, where the mirror images cannot be superimposed. The prefix "hetero" indicates that one or more carbon atoms have been replaced with a different atom. In some embodiments, the different atom is N, O, or S. The term "host material" is intended to mean a material, usually in the form of a layer, to which a dopant may be added. The host material may or may not have electronic characteristic(s) or the ability to emit, receive, or filter radiation. The term "layer" is used interchangeably with the term "film" and refers to a coating covering a desired area. The term is not limited by size. The area can be as large as an entire device or as small as a specific functional area such as the actual visual display, or as small as a single sub-pixel. Layers and films can be formed by any conventional deposition technique, including vapor deposition, liquid deposition (continuous and discontinuous techniques), and thermal transfer. Continuous deposition techniques, include but are not limited to, spin coating, gravure coating, curtain coating, dip coating, slot-die coating, spray coating, and continuous nozzle coating or printing. Discontinuous deposition techniques include, but are not limited to, ink jet printing, gravure printing, and screen printing. The terms "luminescent material" and "emitter" are intended to mean a material that emits light when activated by an applied voltage (such as in a light-emitting diode or light-emitting electrochemical cell). The term "organic electronic device" or sometimes just "electronic device" is intended to mean a device including one or more organic semiconductor layers or materials. The term "photoactive" refers to a material or layer that emits light when activated by an applied voltage (such as in a light emitting diode or chemical cell), that emits light after the absorption of photons (such as in down-converting phosphor devices), or that responds to radiant energy and generates a signal with or without an applied bias voltage (such as in a photodetector or a photovoltaic cell). The term "silyl" refers to the group R3Si-, where R is H, D, C1 -20 alkyl, fluoroalkyl, or aryl. The term "stereoisomers" refers to isomeric molecules that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms, but that differ only in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space. One stereoisomer cannot be superimposed on another. All groups may be unsubstituted or substituted. The substituent groups are discussed below. In this specification, unless explicitly stated otherwise or indicated to the contrary by the context of usage, where an embodiment of the subject matter hereof is stated or described as comprising, including, containing, having, being composed of or being constituted by or of certain features or elements, one or more features or elements in addition to those explicitly stated or described may be present in the embodiment. An alternative embodiment of the disclosed subject matter hereof, is described as consisting essentially of certain features or elements, in which embodiment features or elements that would materially alter the principle of operation or the distinguishing characteristics of the embodiment are not present therein. A further alternative embodiment of the described subject matter hereof is described as consisting of certain features or elements, in which embodiment, or in insubstantial variations thereof, only the features or elements specifically stated or described are present. Also, use of "a" or "an" are employed to describe elements and components described herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the scope of the invention. This description should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless it is obvious that it is meant otherwise. Group numbers corresponding to columns within the Periodic Table of the elements use the "New Notation" convention as seen in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 81 st Edition (2000-2001 ).

All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety, unless a particular passage is citedln case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. To the extent not described herein, many details regarding specific materials, processing acts, and circuits are conventional and may be found in textbooks and other sources within the organic light-emitting diode display, photodetector, photovoltaic cell, and semiconductive member arts. 2. Diastereomers of Formula I The ligands in the composition of Formula I have the general structure shown below, where R3 is not shown: These ligands are chiral because R1 and R2 are not the same. This can be easily understood by making reference to the diagram below. The Iigand and its mirror image are non-superimposable. Thus, two molecules in the diagram are enantiomers of one another. In principle, the two molecules in the diagram can interconvert if there is rotation about the bond connecting the phenyl group containing groups R1 and R2 and the nitrogen atom. However, this bond rotation in the ligands in the complexes of Formula I is highly hindered. Thus, the enantiomers in the diagram below may be termed atropisomers. Depending on the identity of R1 , R2, and Ar'; one atropisomer will be denoted M and the other P. It is well known that octahedral ML3 complexes, wherein L is a bidentate ligand, are also chiral. This can be seen in the diagram below. The two structures are non-superimposable mirror images. The two enantiomers can be described as defining left-handed ("Λ") or right- handed ("Δ") helices (see S. Herrero and M. A. Uson J. Chem. Ed. 1995, 72, 1065 for the naming convention). When three chiral bidentate ligands are coordinated to a chiral metal center, stereoisomers result. There are eight possible stereoisomers when three identical chiral bidentate ligands are complexed to an octahedral metal center. That is because the ligand is a racemate (a 50/50 mixture of enantiomers) and the Ir center is a racemate as well ("Λ" or "Δ" as shown above). These stereoisomers are actually four diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers. The lrl_3 complex as formed, can be separated into four physically different diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers. When the chiral bidentate ligands are atropisomers, they may be designated as "M" and "P". The four different diastereomeric pairs of lrl_3 enantiomers are thus designated as (a) Λ-ΜΜΜ/Δ-ΡΡΡ, (b) Δ-ΜΡΡ/Λ-ΡΜΜ. (c) Λ-ΜΡΡ/Δ-ΡΜΜ, and (d) Δ-ΜΜΜ/Λ-ΡΡΡ. In the above designations, Δ and Λ refer to the stereochemistry of the iridium center, and M and P refer to stereochemistry of the ligands It is possible to distinguish between MMM/PPP and MPP/PMM diastereomenc pairs of enantiomers by NMR. This determination is possible because in the MMM/PPP diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers all three ligands are equivalent, whereas in the MPP/PMM diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers they are all inequivalent. The relative configuration at Ir (i.e. Δ vs. Λ) can be determined by x-ray crystallography. In some cases it is only known whether the complex is an MMM/PPP or MPP/PMM diastereomeric pair of enantiomers. In those instances where x-ray quality crystals can be obtained, the relative configuration at Ir can be determined. In the description herein, the stereochemistry of the complexed ligand is characterized according to the rules described in Bringmann, et al. The assignment of the absolute configuration depends on the relative priority of the substituents that are attached to the two aromatic groups that are connected by the rotationally restricted bond. For example, in the two atropisomers below, Ph > iPr and Ar' > Phenyl. Application of the rules in Bringmann et al. leads to the atropisomers being designated as shown. 3. Compositions having Formula I There is provided herein a composition capable of being separated into diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers, the composition having Formula I. By this it is meant that distinct compositions can be isolated where the compositions consist essentially of n diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers, where n is 1 , 2, or 3. While many iridium complexes have eight stereoisomeric forms, as discussed above, not all are capable of being separated into the diastereomenc pairs of enantiomers. It has been found, that the complexes of Formula I can be separated into diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers. In some embodiments, a mixture of n diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers can be isolated, where n is 1 , 2, or 3. In some embodiments, a mixture of two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers can be isolated. In some embodiments, a single diastereomeric pair of enantiomers can be isolated.

None of the three pairs is a mirror image of another of the three pairs. In some embodiments, the composition of Formula I is deuterated. In some embodiments, the composition of Formula I is at least 10% deuterated. By "% deuterated" or "% deuteration" is meant the ratio of deuterons to the total of hydrogens plus deuterons, expressed as a percentage. The deuteriums may be on the same or different groups. In some embodiments, the diastereomeric pair of enantiomers of Formula I is at least 25% deuterated; in some embodiments, at least 50% deuterated; in some embodiments, at least 75% deuterated; in some embodiments, at least 90% deuterated. In some embodiments, Ar' is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, substituted derivatives thereof, and deuterated analogs thereof. In some embodiments, substituents are selected from the group consisting of phenyl, 1 -napthyl, 1 -naphthyl, C1 -10 alkyl, C3-12 silyl, and deuterated analogs thereof. In some embodiments, Ar' has Formula II Formula II wherein: R4 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, silyl, aryl, and deuterated analogs thereof, and * indicates the point of attachment to the triazine ring of the ligand.

In some embodiments, R1 is an unsubstituted alkyl or unsubstituted deuterated alkyl having 1 -6 carbons. In some embodiments, R1 is an unsubstituted alkyl or unsubstituted deuterated alkyl having 1 -3 carbons. In some embodiments, R1 is a silyl or deuterated silyl having 3-6 carbons. In some embodiments, R1 is a C6-12 aryl or C6-12 deuterated aryl. In some embodiments, R1 is phenyl or deuterated phenyl. In some embodiments, R2 is selected from H and D.

Any of the above embodiments can be combined with one or more of the other embodiments, so long as they are not mutually exclusive and with the proviso that no more than one of R1 and R2 is H or D, and R1≠ R2. For example, the embodiment in which R1 is an alkyl or deuterated alkyl having 3-20 carbons can be combined with the embodiment in which R2 is phenyl or deuterated phenyl and the embodiment where the composition consists essentially of one diastereomeric pair of enantiomers. The same is true for the other non-mutually-exclusive embodiments discussed above. The skilled person would understand which embodiments were mutually exclusive and would thus readily be able to determine the combinations of embodiments that are contemplated by the present application. In the discussion herein, reference to "the diastereomeric pair of enantiomers" is intended to refer to n diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers, where n is 1 , 2, or 3.

Synthesis The ligands for the compositions having Formula I described herein can be synthesized by a variety of procedures that have precedent in the literature. The exact procedure chosen will depend on a variety of factors, including availability of starting materials and reaction yield. In one method a diaryl 1 ,3,4-oxadiazole is prepared from a carboxylic acid and an acyl hydrazide (Dickson, H. D.; Li, C. Tet. Lett. 2009, 50, 6435). The 1 ,3,4-oxadiazole is then allowed to react with an aniline in the presence of aluminum chloride to afford the desired 4H- 1 ,2,4-triazole (Chiriac, C. I. et al., Rev. Roum. Chim. 2010, 55, 175). An example of this method is shown below, where HATU = 2~(7~Aza-1 H- Benzo riazole -1 -yi)-1 ,1 ,3,3- tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, DIEA = diisopropy!ethy!amine, Burgess Reagent = methyl N- (triethylammoniumsulfonyl)carbamate, THF = tetrahydrofuran, and NMP = 1 -methyl-2-pyrollidinone). In another method, 2-phenyl-1 ,3,4-oxadiazole is allowed to react with an aniline, affording a diaryl-substituted triazole (Korotikh, N.I. et al. Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds 2005, 41, 866). The triazole is then allowed to react with N-bromosuccinimide affording a brominated 1 ,2,4- triazole, which then undergoes Suzuki coupling to afford a triaryl- substituted 4H-1 ,2,4-triazole. An example of this method is shown below: Reflux The Huisgen rearrangement reaction is yet another method that was used to prepare sterically hindered 4H-1 ,2,4-triazoles (Kaim, L. E.; Grimaud, L; Patil, P. Org. Lett. 2011 , 13, 1261 .). The rearrangement takes advantage of the fast kinetics of an intramolecular cyclization driven by generation of N2 to form bonds between bulky groups. The synthetic sequence is summarized below. It is modular and convergent, allowing for flexibility in tuning the substituents on the triazole core. The starting materials for the Huisgen rearrangement can be prepared from the readily available isonitrile and 5-phenyl-1 H-tetrazole. In the same pot, the tetrazolyl imidoyl bromide undergoes rearrangement to from 3-bromo- 1 ,2,4-triazole. The last step of the ligand synthesis is the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The compositions having Formula I were prepared by the reaction of commercially available lr(acetylacetonate)3 with excess ligand at elevated temperatures. This reaction typically results in cyclometallation of three equivalents of ligand onto iridium and formation of three equivalents of acetylacetone. The lrl_3 product, wherein L is the cyclometallated ligand, can be isolated and purified by chromatography and/or recrystallization. The diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers can be separated by chromatographic methods, such as flash chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography. The structure of the diastereomeric pair of enantiomers can be determined by NMR and x-ray crystallography, as discussed above. 5.

In some embodiments, the photoactive layer is pixellated, as shown in FIG. 2. In device 200, layer 140 is divided into pixel or subpixel units 141 , 142, and 143 which are repeated over the layer. Each of the pixel or subpixel units represents a different color. In some embodiments, the subpixel units are for red, green, and blue. Although three subpixel units are shown in the figure, two or more than three may be used. In some embodiments, the different layers have the following range of thicknesses: anode 1 10, 500-5000 A, in some embodiments, 1000- 2000 A; hole injection layer 120, 50-2000 A, in some embodiments, 200- 1000 A; hole transport layer 130, 50-2000 A, in some embodiments, 200- 1000 A; photoactive layer 140, 10-2000 A, in some embodiments, 100- 1000 A; electron transport layer 150, 50-2000 A, in some embodiments, 100-1000 A; cathode 160, 200-10000 A, in some embodiments, 300-5000 A. The desired ratio of layer thicknesses will depend on the exact nature of the materials used.

In some embodiments, the hole transport layer comprises a hole transport polymer. In some embodiments, the hole transport polymer is a distyrylaryl compound. In some embodiments, the aryl group has two or more fused aromatic rings. In some embodiments, the aryl group is an acene. The term "acene" as used herein refers to a hydrocarbon parent component that contains two or more ortho-lused benzene rings in a straight linear arrangement. Other commonly used hole transporting polymers are polyvinylcarbazole, (phenylmethyl)-polysilane, and polyaniline. It is also possible to obtain hole transporting polymers by doping hole transporting molecules such as those mentioned above into polymers such as polystyrene and polycarbonate. In some cases, triarylamine polymers are used, especially triarylamine-fluorene copolymers. In some cases, the polymers and copolymers are crosslinkable. . In some embodiments, the hole transport layer further comprises a p-dopant. In some embodiments, the hole transport layer is doped with a p-dopant. Examples of p-dopants include, but are not limited to, tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) and perylene-3,4,9,10- tetracarboxylic-3,4,9,10-dianhydride (PTC DA). Examples of electron transport materials which can be used for layer 150 include, but are not limited to, metal chelated oxinoid compounds, including metal quinolate derivatives such as tris(8- hydroxyquinolato)aluminum (AIQ), bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato)(p- phenylphenolato) aluminum (BAIq), tetrakis-(8-hydroxyquinolato)hafnium (HfQ) and tetrakis-(8-hydroxyquinolato)zirconium (ZrQ); and azole compounds such as 2- (4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-t-butylphenyl)-1 ,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD), 3-(4-biphenylyl)-4-phenyl-5-(4-t-butylphenyl)-1 ,2,4-triazole (TAZ), and 1 ,3,5-tri(phenyl-2-benzimidazole)benzene (TPBI); quinoxaline derivatives such as 2,3-bis(4-fluorophenyl)quinoxaline; phenanthrolines such as 4,7-diphenyl-1 ,10-phenanthroline (DPA) and 2, 9-di methyl -4,7- diphenyl-1 ,10-phenanthroline (DDPA); and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the electron transport layer further comprises an n-dopant. N-dopant materials are well known. The n-dopants include, but are not limited to, Group 1 and 2 metals; Group 1 and 2 metal salts, such as LiF, CsF, and CS2CO3; Group 1 and 2 metal organic compounds, such as Li quinolate; and molecular n-dopants, such as leuco dyes, metal complexes, such as W2(hpp)4 where hpp=1 ,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido-[1 ,2-a]- pyrimidine and cobaltocene, tetrathianaphthacene, bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene, heterocyclic radicals or diradicals, and the dimers, oligomers, polymers, dispiro compounds and polycydes of heterocyclic radical or diradicals. An anti-quenching layer may be present between the photoactive layer and the electron transport layer to prevent quenching of blue luminance by the electron transport layer. To prevent energy transfer quenching, the triplet energy of the anti-quenching material has to be higher than the triplet energy of the blue emitter. To prevent electron transfer quenching, the LUMO level of the anti-quenching material has to be shallow enough (with respect to the vacuum level) such that electron transfer between the emitter exciton and the anti-quenching material is endothermic. Furthermore, the HOMO level of the anti-quenching material has to be deep enough (with respect to the vacuum level) such that electron transfer between the emitter exciton and the anti-quenching material is endothermic. In general, anti-quenching material is a large band-gap material with high triplet energy. Examples of materials for the anti-quenching layer include, but are not limited to, tnphenylene, tnphenylene derivatives, carbazole, carbazole derivatives, and deuterated analogs thereof. Some specific materials include those shown below. An optional electron injection layer may be deposited over the electron transport layer. Examples of electron injection materials include, but are not limited to, Li-containing organometallic compounds, LiF, Li2O, Li quinolate, Cs-containing organometallic compounds, CsF, Cs2O, and CS2CO3. This layer may react with the underlying electron transport layer, the overlying cathode, or both. When an electron injection layer is present, the amount of material deposited is generally in the range of 1 - 100 A, in some embodiments 1 -10 A. The cathode 160, is an electrode that is particularly efficient for injecting electrons or negative charge carriers. The cathode can be any metal or nonmetal having a lower work function than the anode. Materials for the cathode can be selected from alkali metals of Group 1 (e.g., Li, Cs), the Group 2 (alkaline earth) metals, the Group 12 metals, including the rare earth elements and lanthanides, and the actinides. Materials such as aluminum, indium, calcium, barium, samarium and magnesium, as well as combinations, can be used. It is known to have other layers in organic electronic devices. For example, there can be a layer (not shown) between the anode 1 10 and hole injection layer 120 to control the amount of positive charge injected and/or to provide band-gap matching of the layers, or to function as a protective layer. Layers that are known in the art can be used, such as copper phthalocyanine, silicon oxy-nitride, fluorocarbons, silanes, or an ultra-thin layer of a metal, such as Pt. Alternatively, some or all of anode layer 1 10, active layers 120, 130, 140, and 150, or cathode layer 160, can be surface-treated to increase charge carrier transport efficiency. The choice of materials for each of the component layers is preferably determined by balancing the positive and negative charges in the emitter layer to provide a device with high electroluminescence efficiency. It is understood that each functional layer can be made up of more than one layer. c.

The reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen, then heated to 241 °C for 63 h under nitrogen to form a mixture including Composition B4. Step 3: Isolation of diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers The resultant mixture from above was allowed to cool to room temperature, then dissolved in ethyl acetate. TLC showed 4 major components of mixture. By silica gel column chromatography (0-10% ethyl acetate in hexane) only two of the components were purely separated to provide two diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers as solid material. The first compound (60mg, 4.4% yield) was determined to be B4-a, ΔΡΡΡ/ΛΜΜΜ, by X-ray crystallography. The structure is shown below, where Ar' = ortho-methylphenyl. Stereochemistry at Ir center is Δ Stereochemistry at Ir center is Λ The second compound (200mg, 14.8% yield) was determined to be B4-b, ΔΜΡΡ/ΛΡΜΜ, by X-ray crystallography. The structure is shown below, where Ar' = ortho-methylphenyl. Stereochemistry at Ir center is Δ Stereochemistry at Ir center is Λ Device Examples These examples demonstrate the fabrication and performance of OLED devices. (1 ) Materials HIJ-1 is an electrically conductive polymer doped with a polymeric fluorinated sulfonic acid. Such materials have been described in, for example, published U.S. patent applications US 2004/0102577, US 2004/0127637, US 2005/0205860, and published PCT application WO 2009/018009. HT-1 is a triarylamine-containing polymer. Such materials have been described in, for example, published PCT application WO 2009/067419. Host-1 is shown below Host-2 is shown below ET-1 is a metal quinolate complex. The devices had the following structure on a glass substrate: anode = Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), 50 nm hole injection layer = HIJ-1 (50 nm) hole transport layer = HT-1 (20 nm) photoactive layer, discussed below = 100:16 Hos dopant ratio (38 nm); anti-quenching layer = Same as host in photoactive layer (10nm) electron transport layer = ET-1 (10 nm) electron injection layer/cathode = CsF/AI (1 /100 nm) (2) Device fabrication OLED devices were fabricated by a combination of solution processing and thermal evaporation techniques. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates from Thin Film Devices, Inc were used. These ITO substrates are based on Corning 1737 glass coated with ITO having a sheet resistance of 30 ohms/square and 80% light transmission. The patterned ITO substrates were cleaned ultrasonically in aqueous detergent solution and rinsed with distilled water. The patterned ITO was subsequently cleaned ultrasonically in acetone, rinsed with isopropanol, and dried in a stream of nitrogen. Immediately before device fabrication the cleaned, patterned ITO substrates were treated with UV ozone for 10 minutes. Immediately after cooling, an aqueous dispersion of HIJ-1 was spin-coated over the ITO surface and heated to remove solvent. After cooling, the substrates were then spin-coated with a hole transport solution, and then heated to remove solvent. The substrates were masked and placed in a vacuum chamber. The photoactive layer, the electron transport layer and the anti-quenching layer were deposited by thermal evaporation, followed by a layer of CsF. Masks were then changed in vacuo and a layer of Al was deposited by thermal evaporation. The chamber was vented, and the devices were encapsulated using a glass lid, dessicant, and UV curable epoxy. (3) Device characterization The OLED samples were characterized by measuring their (1 ) current-voltage (l-V) curves, (2) electroluminescence radiance versus voltage, and (3) electroluminescence spectra versus voltage. All three measurements were performed at the same time and controlled by a computer. The current efficiency of the device at a certain voltage is determined by dividing the electroluminescence radiance of the LED by the current density needed to run the device. The unit is a cd/A. The color coordinates were determined using either a Minolta CS-100 meter or a Photoresearch PR-705 meter.
