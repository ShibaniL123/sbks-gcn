FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to fluorescence spectroscopy, and more particularly to, intra-operative fluorescence spectroscopy and applications of same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The endocrine system is a complex system of organs and glands which includes the thyroid and parathyroid. The anatomy of the neck is illustrated in Figure 1. The thyroid gland regulates many developmental and metabolic processes. Common diseases of the thyroid include goiters, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, benign and malignant nodules, and autoimmune diseases such as Graves' disease. Surgery is the most common treatment for Graves's disease, goiters, benign thyroid nodules, and thyroid cancers. The parathyroid lies within the same region as the thyroid in the neck and functions to control calcium levels in the blood. The most common parathyroid disorder is primary hyperparathyroidism, in which one or more of the parathyroid glands, become enlarged and hyperactive. This causes excess secretion of parathyroid hormone and a disruption in normal bone and mineral metabolism. The prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism has been estimated at 21 cases per 100,000 person-years. In 80% of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a single overactive parathyroid gland and surgical removal of the diseased parathyroid gland is the only definitive treatment. Typically there are four tan parathyroid glands, each approximately 6 to 8 mm in size. They are typically positioned within the neck but can vary in location within the body and are sometimes intrathymic. Due to their small size and variability in position, the parathyroid glands are often difficult to distinguish from surrounding tissue and thyroid in the neck. The parathyroid visually resembles its surrounding tissue and this can extend surgical time during a parathyroidectomy, during which the surgeon is simply searching for the small organ. Accidental removal or damage to healthy parathyroids during parathyroid or thyroid surgery can result in serious complications such as hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism may result from direct injury, devascularization, and/or disruption of the parathyroid glands. Statistics suggest that temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism rates are between 4-20% during thyroid surgery. The most common complications of both parathyroid and thyroid surgery are postoperative hypocalcemia, vocal-cord paralysis, and hematoma. The current surgical procedure for thyroid and parathyroid surgeries involves a systematic search within the neck in which the surgeon is mainly relying on visual inspection to identify target tissues. The incidence of complications occurring due to this subjective method is directly proportional to the extent of thyroidectomy and inversely proportional to the experience of the surgeon. The disadvantages to the current method include the lengthy duration of the surgery, the exploratory nature of the surgery, and the lack of preoperative and intra-operative imaging. Confirmation of removal of the diseased parathyroid relies on histopathology or post-operative diagnosis of symptoms. There is a need for a reliable imaging system to help identify the parathyroid glands intra-operatively. Moreover, while surgical guidance system has been developed and utilized for brain surgery and other organ surgery procedures, none is available for thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. Therefore, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the art to address the aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.

The use of examples anywhere in this specification including examples of any terms discussed herein is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified term. Likewise, the invention is not limited to various embodiments given in this specification. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. In the case of conflict, the present document, including definitions will control. As used herein, "around", "about" or "approximately" shall generally mean within 20 percent, preferably within 10 percent, and more preferably within 5 percent of a given value or range. Numerical quantities given herein are approximate, meaning that the term "around", "about" or "approximately" can be inferred if not expressly stated. As used herein, the term "living subject" refers to a human being such as a patient, or an animal such as a lab testing monkey. As used herein, the term "Raman spectroscopy" refers to an optical technique that probes the specific molecular content of a sample by collecting in-elastically scattered light. As photons propagate through a medium, they undergo both absorptive and scattering events. In absorption, the energy of the photons is completely transferred to the material, allowing either heat transfer (internal conversion) or re-emission phenomena such as fluorescence and phosphorescence to occur. Scattering, however, is normally an in-elastic process, in which the incident photons retain their energy. In Raman scattering, the photons either donate or acquire energy from the medium, on a molecular level. In contrast to fluorescence, where the energy transfers are on the order of the electronic bandgaps, the energy transfers associated with Raman scattering are on the order of the vibrational modes of the molecule. These vibrational modes are molecularly specific, giving every molecule a unique Raman spectral signature. Raman scattering is a very weak phenomena, and therefore practical measurement of Raman spectra of a medium requires high power excitation laser sources and extremely sensitive detection hardware. Even with these components, the Raman spectra from tissue are masked by the relatively intense tissue auto-fluorescence. After detection, post processing techniques are required to subtract the fluorescent background and enable accurate visualization of the Raman spectra. Raman spectra are plotted as a function of frequency shift in units of wavenumber (cm-1). The region of the Raman spectra where most biological molecules have Raman peaks is from 500 to 2000 cm-1. In contrast to fluorescence spectra, Raman spectra have sharp spectral features that enable easier identification of the constituent sources of spectral peaks in a complex sample. In the context of detecting the changes that cancerous tissues undergo, differences in the Raman spectral features that correlate to the increased nucleic acid content in neoplastic cells has observed. The term "fluorescence spectroscopy" or its acronym "fluorometry" or "spectrofluorometry" refers to a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy which analyzes fluorescence from a sample. It involves using a beam of light, usually ultraviolet light, that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light of a lower energy, typically, but not necessarily, visible light. A complementary technique is absorption spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy utilizes that fact that molecules have various states referred to as energy levels. Fluorescence spectroscopy is primarily concerned with electronic and vibrational states of energy. Generally, the sample being examined will have a ground electronic state (a low energy state) of interest, and an excited electronic state of higher energy. Within each of these electronic states are various vibrational states. In fluorescence spectroscopy, the sample is first excited, by absorbing a photon, from its ground electronic state to one of the various vibrational states in the excited electronic state. Collisions with other molecules cause the excited molecule to lose vibrational energy until it reaches the lowest vibrational state of the excited electronic state. The molecule then drops down to one of the various vibrational levels of the ground electronic state again, emitting a photon in the process. As molecules may drop down into any of several vibrational levels in the ground state, the emitted photons will have different energies, and thus frequencies. Therefore, by analysing the different frequencies of light emitted in fluorescent spectroscopy, along with their relative intensities, the structure of the different vibrational levels can be determined. In a typical measurement, the different frequencies of fluorescent light emitted by a sample are measured, holding the excitation light at a constant wavelength. This is called an emission spectrum. An excitation spectrum is measured by recording a number of emission spectra using different wavelengths of excitation light. As used herein, the term "auto-fluorescence" refers to the fluorescence of other substances than the fluorophore of interest. It increases the background signal. Autofluorescence can be problematic in fluorescence microscopy. In most fluorescence microscopy, fluorescent stains (such as fluorescently-labeled antibodies) are applied to samples to stain specific structures. Auto-fluorescence interferes with detection of the resulting specific fluorescent signals, especially when the signals of interest are very dim - it causes structures other than those of interest to become visible. Depending upon the shape of the structures of interest and the other structures, it may not be obvious that this has occurred. In some microscopes (mainly confocal microscopes), it is possible to make use of different lifetime of the excited states of the added fluorescent markers and the endogenous molecules to exclude most of the auto-fluorescence. In a few cases, auto-fluorescence may actually illuminate the structures of interest, or serve as a useful diagnostic indicator such as in the case of "biological autofluorescence", which refers to the fact that cells contain molecules, which become fluorescent when excited by UV/Vis radiation of suitable wavelength. This fluorescence emission, arising from endogenous fluorophores, is an intrinsic property of cells and is called auto-fluorescence to be distinguished from fluorescent signals obtained by adding exogenous markers. The majority of cell auto-fluorescence originates from mitochondria and lysosomes. Together with aromatic amino acids and lipo-pigments, the most important endogenous fluorophores are pyridinic (NADPH) and flavin coenzymes. In tissues, the extracellular matrix often contributes to the auto-fluorescence emission more than the cellular component, because collagen and elastin have, among the endogenous fluorophores, a relatively high quantum yield. Changes occurring in the cell and tissue state during physiological and/or pathological processes result in modifications of the amount and distribution of endogenous fluorophores and chemical-physical properties of their microenvironment. Therefore, analytical techniques based on auto-fluorescence monitoring may be utilized in order to obtain information about morphological and physiological state of cells and tissues. Moreover, auto-fluorescence analysis can be performed in real time because it does not require any treatment of fixing or staining of the specimens. In the past few years spectroscopic and imaging techniques have been developed for many different applications both in basic research and diagnostics. [SeeBiotechnol Annu Rev. 2005;11:227-56. Cell and tissue autofluorescence research and diagnostic applications. Monici M.] The present invention provides a case where autofluorescence finds good use. As used herein, "charge-coupled device" or "CCD" refers to an-analog shift register that enables the transportation of analog signals (electric charges) through successive stages (capacitors), controlled by a clock signal. Charge-coupled devices can be used as a form of memory or for delaying samples of analog signals. Today, they are most widely used in arrays of photoelectric light sensors to serialize parallel analog signals. In a CCD for capturing images, there is a photoactive region (an epitaxial layer of silicon), and a transmission region made out of a shift register (the CCD, properly speaking). An image is projected through a lens onto the capacitor array (the photoactive region), causing each capacitor to accumulate an electric charge proportional to the light intensity at that location. A one-dimensional array, used in line-scan cameras, captures a single slice of the image, while a two-dimensional array, used in video and still cameras, captures a two-dimensional picture corresponding to the scene projected onto the focal plane of the sensor. Once the array has been exposed to the image, a control circuit causes each capacitor to transfer its contents to its neighbor (operating as a shift register). The last capacitor in the array dumps its charge into a charge amplifier, which converts the charge into a voltage. By repeating this process, the controlling circuit converts the entire semiconductor contents of the array to a sequence of voltages, which it samples, digitizes and stores in some form of memory. As used herein, "plurality" means two or more. As used herein, the terms "comprising," "including," "carrying," "having," "containing," "involving," and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. OVERVIEW OF THE INVENTION As set forth above, thyroid and parathyroid diseases combine the fields of endocrinology and oncology leading to a complex combination of conditions1. When the disease cannot be treated by other methods, surgical means are used to remove the diseased gland(s). The thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, nerves, adipose tissue, and lymph nodes are closely positioned in the neck region. Due to their close proximity and tendency to blend into each other, many of these structures, specifically the parathyroid glands, are difficult to distinguish visually during endocrine surgery. The situation is further complicated by its small size and variability in position. Surgeons must ultimately rely on visual inspection to identify the different tissues, which can be subjective and often inconclusive2,3. Complications occur when the parathyroid is accidentally injured or removed during thyroidectomies or only partially removed in the case of parathyroidectomies4: Existing methods for identifying parathyroid glands are limited and have deficiencies that can result in surgical complications 5. Current technology relies on histopathology or post-operative diagnosis of symptoms to determine if the parathyroid was accidentally or incompletely removed6. An accurate, automated diagnostic method could allow faster, more effective patient management7,8. Optical spectroscopy can detect differences in tissue architecture and biochemical composition. In particular, fluorescence spectroscopy has been of considerable interest in the development of new clinical diagnostic tools. Fluorescence measurements of human tissue can be made in real-time, without tissue removal and diagnosis based on tissue fluorescence can be easily automated 9. Fluorescent molecules typically exhibit signal in the UV/VIS wavelengths, or about 400 - 700 nm10. As excitation wavelengths become longer, auto-fluorescence decreases 10. There are no published accounts of near infrared auto-fluorescence being used as a diagnosic tool, and there is currently no real-time method for identifying parathyroid tissue intra-operatively. It is believed that for the first time, near-infrared wavelengths have been utilized in the present invention and attractive to the inventors due to their increased penetration depth in biological tissues. In one aspect, the present invention provides, among other things, a process or method of using near-infrared auto-fluorescence for the identification of the parathyroid in vivo during endocrine surgery. Such a method could prevent accidental or incomplete removal of parathyroid glands. In another aspect, the present invention provides real time imaging systems that can detect the near infrared auto-fluorescence from the tissues in the neck in real time to guide surgical resection or surgical procedure. In one embodiment, a spectral imaging system, which provides x-y spatial imaging with spectral information in the z direction, was built to detect near-infrared auto-fluorescence. The system includes a near infrared light source for emitting a beam of near-infrared light, a light guide or optical fiber(s) that delivers the light to the tissue, a camera mounted on a stand or to an optical microscope, with a variable filter that can select emission wavelengths, and a computer with a controller in communication with each component/device of the system to coordinate the operation. In operation, tissue was placed under the camera, the near infrared auto-fluorescence imaging signals from the tissue were collected and acquired through the camera, and stored in a memory for further processing. In another embodiment, an imaging system provides an x-y image (or video image) of the field at a given NIR wavelength with the sensitivity needed for tissue fluorescence measurements. An exemplary device was built with a FIND-R-SCOPE®. Such a system can be made as a portable and hand-held device, in which the image is viewed through a built-in viewer by a user such as a surgeon to see the auto-fluorescence from the tissue or from the targeted area of the tissues on site. The viewer can also be connected to a display with or without a CCD camera attachment. The imaging system can be used to guide the surgeon intra-operatively through a surgical procedure to identify the tissues that are need to be acted on. In short, according to several embodiments of the present invention, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence is used to identify parathyroid glands during thyroid and parathyroidectomies. The present invention utilized the discovery that parathyroid tissue had unique optical signals to identify the parathyroid glands and differentiate them from other tissues in the neck intra-operatively, in which the intensity of the parathyroid signal was compared to the fluorescence of the surrounding tissue including the thyroid gland. Several fluorescence measurements were conducted according to the present invention on patients who were undergone endocrine surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. In each of the measurements, the parathyroid had markedly higher levels of fluorescence. These results indicate that NIR fluorescence provides an excellent tool to locate parathyroid tissue in endocrine surgery. Further description will be made as to the embodiments of the present invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of Figs. 1-11. IMPLEMENTATIONS AND EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION Without intent to limit the scope of the invention, exemplary methods and their related results according to the embodiments of the present invention are given below. Note that titles or subtitles may be used in the examples for convenience of a reader, which in no way should limit the scope of the invention. Moreover, certain theories are proposed and disclosed herein; however, in no way they, whether they are right or wrong, should limit the scope of the invention so long as the invention is practiced according to the invention without regard for any particular theory or scheme of action. EXAMPLE 1 This example in part illustrates a method or process, with corresponding apparatus or system, according to one embodiment of the present invention. A system according to one embodiment of the present invention allows a surgeon to correctly differentiate between thyroid and parathyroid tissue intra-operatively and immediately. Due to their differing optical properties, thyroid, parathyroid and fat can be easily differentiated intra-operatively by the system. When a 785 nm laser excites a neck area of tissue, the parathyroid fluoresces with a greater intensity than the surrounding thyroid tissue. Adipose tissue will not create detectable fluorescence. Both the thyroid and parathyroid fluoresce at about 822 nm, with the parathyroid fluorescing with greater intensity. The system described in this Example allows the 822 nm light created by the thyroid and parathyroid to be viewed directly by the surgeon as visible light. The parathyroid visualization unit according to one embodiment of the present invention is easy to use, requiring as little training as possible. It also effectively decreases operative time and the number of unsuccessful operations, thereby greatly reducing the need for costly secondary operations. The system may be coupled with equipment already present in the operating room ("OR"). There are currently no methods consistently used intra-operatively to differentiate between thyroid and parathyroid tissue. The system according to one embodiment of the present invention has following features: it uses optical fibers running from a light source such as a 785 nm laser source to excite the tissue, and return fibers running to a detector to detect and quantify the intensity of the fluorescence coming off of the tissue. The system has a display device, allowing for the surgeon to view the differing fluorescence of the two or more tissue types, instead of interpreting a numerical intensity value. The system is attachable to a head-unit that the surgeon could wear during surgery. The new system is in real-time. This real-time factor could decrease time in the OR by creating an intra-operative imaging modality. This would eliminate the need to send tissue samples to histology during surgery and thus reduce any wait times associated with this. The system is adapted to be able to excite an area equal to the size of the surgeon's incision. It was determined that expanding the excitation beam to 1 cm2 would create a beam with adequate power to excite the parathyroid tissue yet was still great enough in size to also excite the surrounding tissue. Methodology . To allow the system according to one embodiment of the present invention has visualization ability, several cameras and viewers were tried and/or evaluated to determine which would be most suitable for this feature. A viewer system with peak sensitivity around 825 nm and the ability to visually show the surgeon the NIR light within the visual spectrum was needed. The FIND-R-SCOPE® Infrared Viewer Model 84499A was the final choice. This viewer has spectral sensitivity from 350 to 1350 nm with peak sensitivity at 800 nm, very close to the 822 nm fluorescence coming from the parathyroid tissue. This model is also lightweight, a feature preferred for attachment to a head-unit. To view only the fluorescence of the tissue, an 820 nm long pass filter was placed in front of the viewer. This was important because it removed the high intensity 785 nm laser light as well as visible light and would reduce any background signal from overhead lights during surgery. Additionally, the different means of exciting a larger area of tissue than a laser independently would excite tried and/or evaluated. The diameter of the laser beam was measured at approximately 0.3 cm which is rather smaller than the desired one square centimeter. A liquid light guide was utilized because it would excite the desired area of tissue while at the same time, maintain the power necessary to excite the tissue. A liquid light guide from Newport® (Model: 77639 Liquid Light Guide, 420-2000 nm, 0.3 in Core, 3.9 in Bend Radius, 79 in Length) was used in practice. This liquid light guide is compatible with light in the NIR, has a great enough numerical aperture such that a fiber from the laser could be directly coupled into the liquid light guide, and is long enough to allow the laser source to be separate from the excitation-detection system. Other liquid light guides having comparable parameters can also be utilized to practice the present invention. The excitation setup of the system according to one embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Figure 2, used a 785 nm laser coupled to an optical fiber with a diameter of 400 µm and a numerical aperture of 0.22. This cable was then directly coupled to the liquid light guide. The numerical aperture of the liquid light guide is greater than that of the fiber and thus no optics were needed to couple the fiber to the liquid light guide. A Newport® lens with a focal length of 25.4 mm was used at an approximate distance of 6 cm from the liquid light guide to focus the beam. The diameter of the beam when focused was approximately 1.2 cm. Rather than creating a head unit with a NIR viewer that a surgeon could flip in front of his eyes, a second option was investigated to couple the viewer to a camera and then view the fluorescing tissue on an external screen. A Sony® SC-75 CCD video camera module coupled with the FIND-R-SCOPE® and Pinnacle® software was used to view the fluorescing tissue on an external screen. This setup was also used to take pictures of fluorescence. Spatial Resolution Test. In order to quantify the spatial resolution of the viewer, the NBS 1963A spatial resolution test card shown in Figure 3 was used. The test card was placed on a reflectance pad, a light source was used to provide adequate lighting, and the viewer was then focused to determine the spatial resolution of the viewer. The spatial resolution was defined as the smallest set of line pairs per mm that the viewer could differentiate. Additionally, the spatial resolution of the coupled viewer/camera system was tested. Again, the test card was placed on a reflectance pad, a light source was used to provide adequate lighting, and the viewer/camera system attempted to focus the on decreasingly smaller line pairs. Spectral Resolution Test. Next, the minimum power at which the viewer can detect light at 785 nm was tested. The fiber from the laser source was shown onto the reflectance pad and the viewer was looked through while power was lowered. The decrease in power was stopped when the spot could no longer be seen through the viewer. A power-meter was used to determine the power of the laser at this point. This test yielded the spectral sensitivity of the viewer. The minimum power at which the viewer/camera system can detect 785 nm light was also tested using the same method. Power versus Distance Test. The next test performed was to determine the relationship between power and distance from the liquid light guide. In a darkened room, the power was measured starting with the light source 21.5 cm from the power meter. The power was measured at approximately one-centimeter intervals with the closest measurement made at a distance of 5.5 cm. Tissue Fluorescence Comparison. Finally the complete system as photoed in Figure 4 was tested. A moveable arm was built and coupled to the liquid light guide. A cage was built in front of the liquid light guide that created a simple reference to ensure that the light from the liquid light guide was properly focused. This excitation system was used to excite human tissue samples of thyroid and parathyroid. The fluorescence of both the thyroid and the parathyroid were viewed using the viewer and pictures were taken using the camera/viewer-coupled system. Spatial Resolution Test Result. Looking directly through the FIND-R-SCOPE viewer, we observed a spatial resolution of approximately 3.6 line pairs per millimeter. The inverse of line pairs per millimeter indicates the smallest structure distinguishable by the system. The viewer can distinguish structures as small as 0.28 mm in size. Viewing through the CCD camera connected to an external monitor, the spatial resolution was reduced to approximately 1.4 line pairs per millimeter. The camera/viewer-coupled system can view structures as small as 0.71 mm in size. Figure 5 is an image of the spatial resolution test card using the CCD camera. Spectral Resolution Test Result. The minimum power at which near-infrared light could be viewed using the viewer was determined to be 3 nW. The spectral resolution of the viewer/camera-coupled system was found to be 8 nW. Figure 6 is a picture taken with the viewer/camera-coupled system. Power versus Distance Test Result. The power of the excitation source versus the distance of the laser from the power reader is given in Figure 7. The power needed for tissue excitation is reached at approximately 120 mW at a distance of 6 cm. Tissue Fluorescence Comparison. While simultaneously exciting the thyroid and parathyroid, fluorescence was observed coming from the parathyroid but not the thyroid. Figure 8 shows an image of the tissue captured under normal overhead lighting as well as an image of the fluorescing tissue with all wavelengths below 820 nm being filtered out by the 820 nm long pass filter. Viewing Fluorescing Tissue. The filter applied to the viewer blocked all wavelengths below 820 nm. Because the excitation laser used operates at a 785 nm, any light from the laser was blocked by the filter, and it cannot be seen. However, parathyroid tissue, which emits fluorescence at about 822 nm, was still visible through the device. As stated previously, parathyroid tissue fluoresces at a much greater intensity than fat or thyroid tissue. The human eye cannot differentiate the parathyroid from surrounding tissue because the parathyroid fluoresces at a wavelength outside of the visible spectrum. This system would allow a surgeon to visually differentiate between tissue types based on fluorescence within the NIR range. System Limitations and Resolution. According to the results of both the spectral and spatial resolution tests, it can be concluded that the resolution of the entire system is mostly limited by the resolution of the CCD camera. In both cases, the resolution observed with the camera attached was significantly lower when viewed with the camera than when viewed directly through the viewer. While the CCD camera can accurately locate fluorescing parathyroid tissue, the system could be improved with a better camera. The system that is not coupled to the CCD camera had better spatial and spectral resolution and ultimately this is the fashion in which the system will be used. Improving the optics of the viewer will increase the spatial resolution of the viewer. The spectral resolution for the viewer alone of 3 nW is very good, and 8 nW spectral resolution of the viewer/camera system is adequate. Overall the system can detect fluorescing parathyroid when using the viewer as well as when using the camera/viewer-coupled system. The current system does not have the sensitivity to view fluorescing thyroid. Parathyroid Location In Vivo. The average human parathyroid measures 5 x 3 x 1 mm9. Using only the viewer, the device is capable of achieving a spatial resolution as good as 0.28 mm. Even with the current camera, the observed resolution of approximately 0.71 mm would still be adequate for locating a parathyroid gland that is smaller than average. Hence, the device could provide useful complimentary information to currently employed imaging methods for locating parathyroid tissue when operating in the neck region. The spatial resolution should be improved in the next generation device however because distinguishing the boundaries of the fluorescing parathyroid can be difficult with the current system. Physical Specifications of the Device. The system's small size and mobility make it adaptable for different operating room layouts. With further work, the device could easily be integrated with existing surgical equipment. The fact that it can be moved easily from place to place makes it cost-effective, as it reduces the need for the purchase of multiple viewing systems to be used by a single hospital. Some Practical Applications. For use of the lens and laser system in surgery, in order to adequately excite the tissue, the end of the liquid light guide will need to be held within this distance of 6 cm. According to the expert advice, all non-sterile equipment must be held at least 12 inches away from the sterile field. Thus, to maintain a safe, sterile environment, the liquid light guide will require sterilization with each use, and the cord should be covered in sterile material. Thus, a system according to one embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in Example 1 is proved that by using the fluorescent properties of the thyroid and parathyroid the system is able to visually differentiate the different tissue types during thyroid and parathyroid surgeries. This system can be developed into a full surgical system that can be installed into operating rooms. Improvements including increased spatial and spectral resolution for both the viewer and any secondary camera system, as well as a fully head mountable detector, viewer and excitation system can be made under the principle of the present invention. This system will help to reduce surgical time and the need for secondary surgeries because the system will allow the surgeon to quickly and efficiently differentiate between fat, thyroid and parathyroid. This visual cue will help the surgeon quickly differentiate between tissue types and possibly remove the need for sending tissue samples to histology during surgery. This will reduce time in surgery and will ensure that the correct tissue is removed eliminating the need for secondary surgeries. Other possible improvements could include image processing to create a real time color map image of the fluorescent profile. EXAMPLE 2 This example in part illustrates a method or process, with corresponding apparatus or system, according to another embodiment of the present invention. Clinical measurements. Measurements were performed at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center under approval of the Vanderbilt Institutional Review board. A sterilized fiber probe was used to take six measurements at each tissue site at integration times of 300 ms. Background measurements were performed by recording with the fluorescent lights off before the laser was turned on. The surgeon's confidence level for each tissue type was recorded. Spectral measurements. Samples were placed on a non-reflective surface and excited with a 6 cm diameter beam. Images were taken at 200 ms acquisition time. Instruments. Tissue was excited with an Innovative Photonic Solutions 785 nm diode laser. Spectra were recorded with an Ocean Optics S2000-FL fluorescence spectrometer. Spectral images were obtained with a Princeton Instruments Photomax 512. Statistical Analyses. Data was averaged over 6 measurements. The data was then normalized to the average peak thyroid intensity. Pairs within a patient with a right-tailed t-test were compared and considered values of P ≤ 0.05 significant. Fluorescence measurements. During the operations, a sterilized optical probe was placed on various tissues in the exposed neck area of a patient and spectral measurements were acquired from each of those sites. The tissue type was noted, as well as the physician's confidence in the investigated sites' histological identity. Spectra were collected using a 300 ms signal collection time. In all cases, the overhead fluorescent lights were turned off during the measurements. Any luminescent lights left on were turned away from the measurement site as they contain spectral components which can interfere with the results. When the tissue was removed in the course of the surgery, specimens from which measurements are taken were then collected for histological identification. All specimens collected were processed and analyzed by a pathologist. Figure 9 depicts a typical spectrum from a patient. The signal from the parathyroid gland has the highest peak intensity and is prominently distinguishable from the other tissues in the neck. The thyroid gland also shows stronger fluorescence than the surrounding muscle and fat. Figure 10 shows the normalized average peak intensity of parathyroid and thyroid measurements from multiple patients. The two glands are compared within each patient. The results are significant with a p-value of 0.000287069. These results clearly illustrate that parathyroid tissue is at least two times more fluorescent than other tissue found in the neck and was as great as eleven times more fluorescent across all patients. Moreover, data was successfully obtained in vivo. It is believed that this was the first study performed in vivo showing near infrared auto-fluorescence. In vitro imaging of tissue. Collecting data in the OR provides in vivo fluorescence measurements, however, the tissue is not always easily accessible. This can lead to inconsistent experimental methods between tissue types. To examine the fluorescence of both tissues equally and gauge the potential for visually capturing the intrinsic fluorescence, spectral images were recorded of pathological samples. Samples of thyroid and parathyroid tissue were placed side by side and illuminated with the 785 nm laser. A filter was used to block all reflected light from the laser. Figure 11 shows both glands fluorescing. The parathyroid is on the right and the thyroid on the left. The parathyroid fluoresces just over twice as much as the thyroid tissue with approximate intensities of 23900 and 9999 respectively. Not only was it possible to capture the intrinsic fluorescence with a camera but the parathyroid exhibits stronger fluorescence in vitro as well as in vivo. Understanding the Results. The results set forth above show that optical spectroscopy according to the present invention can successfully detect parathyroid tissue in endocrine surgery. In each patient the parathyroid signal is greater than the thyroid signal. Moreover, the standard error and p-value show that the parathyroid can be classified with a statistically significant difference each time. This success is very significant for endocrine surgery. Not only can a system according to one embodiment of the present invention discriminate intra-bperatively parathyroid glands from the surrounding tissue but it does so with high accuracy. Whereas other intra-operative locaclization methods can be very time consuming and expensive, NIR fluorescence according to the present invention is quick and relatively cheap 7,8,11. This method is better than the current standard of care for multiple reasons. It is fast and safe way of identifying parathyroid glands during surgery. The amount of energy being delivered to the tissue by the laser is low so no damage can occur. Also, it only takes 300 ms to make a measurement and see drastic changes between thyroid and parathyroid fluorescence. The surgeon has a method of identifying parathyroid glands with high accuracy. NIR fluorescence is not typically seen in biological tissues12. However, in all patients fluorescence is seen above 800 nm, in the range of about 800 nm to 1,000nm, in the thyroid and parathyroid glands but not in the surrounding tissue. This includes fat, muscle, nerve, trachea and lymph tissue. These results raise several questions. Why is this fluorescence only seen in the parathyroid and thyroid glands? Typically fluorescence arises from conjugated bonds providing an excess of pi electrons12. Analysis of the tissue and hormone components may be needed to see if the same effect is occurring or if some other phenomenon is responsible. In vitro imaging of the tissues confirmed the fluorescence persists even outside of the body. The parathyroid fluoresced twice as strong as the thyroid sample reaffirming that the effect is some inherent property of the tissue. Additionally, there is the potential to take the camera to the OR and create a noncontact method of detecting parathyroid glands intra-operatively, which is further described below according to another embodiment of the present invention. The largest problem encountered was with the consistency of parathyroid measurements. Because the glands are not always readily accessible it is hard to maintain proper contact between the probe and tissue. In some cases the measurements had to be repeated because the signal weakened over time as indicating that the probe slipped. This introduces a slight bias in that the problem is assumed to be with the probe but the repeat measurements are at a new site and the effect is not seen in easy accessible glands or ex vivo samples. Additionally, different glands within a patient and between patients give variable measurements. Patient to patient variation is expected and corrected by normalizing the data. Differing intensity within the same patient might be explained by accessibility or different amounts of fat and blood over the tissue but because the underlying basis of the signal is not known this is another assumption. With the exception of loss of contact even the lowest parathyroid signal has been higher than the maximum thyroid signal recorded. The final question is trends in the data. There seems to be no correlation between thyroid or parathyroid signal and age, disease, gender or race. Further patients are required to examine if the signal is random or there is a trend. However, none of these questions challenges the validity and viability of the present invention. Thus, the results from Example 2 are very promising. NIR fluorescence provides an accurate detection of parathyroid tissue intra-operatively. Additional patient data can be collected to determine the underlying source of fluorescence. A larger patient database may provide more robust results as well as help develop algorithms to detect and identify parathyroid tissue. A larger population of patients may also help determine and trends in the data that would increase the accuracy of algorithms and help elucidate the basis of fluorescence. Additionally, chemical decomposition and in depth analysis of the absorption and fluorescence may help narrow down the reason that only parathyroid and thyroid have strong fluorescence in the neck. Understanding the basis of NIR fluorescence would help identify where the system might fail as well as uncover a range of biological fluorescence that was not even though to really exist. But there is no doubt that Example 2 shows validity and viability of the present invention.
