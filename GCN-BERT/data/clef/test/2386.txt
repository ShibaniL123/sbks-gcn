FLAVOR SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MAKING SHERRY WINE LIKE BEVERAGES Cross-Reference to Related Application [0001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. provisional Application No. 61/951,954, filed on March 12, 2014, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. Background [0002] Sherry wine is a fortified wine that is produced in Andalusia, south of Spain. The three major types of sherry wine, Fino, Amontillado and Oloroso, are made of white grapes but undergo different maturation processes. The light sherry wine Fino is aged under a layer of yeast while Oloroso is aged in direct contact with oxygen making it darker. Amontillado is aged under both microbial and oxidative conditions which give a color in between the two. Another particularity of sherry wine is its dynamic aging system which consists of blending wines of different ages in order to achieve uniformity over years. [0003] Currently, sherry wines produced as described above include over 400 known a Ivolatiles, only a small number of which are odorants that are detected by human odorant receptors.

Brief Description of the Drawings [0010] Figure 1 is a flow chart showing the method of making a beverage using a flavor system as described herein. [0011] Figure 2 is a graph comparing the flavor profile of a known Amontillado wine with a beverage formulated according to the methods described herein. Detailed Description [0012] Flavor perception of a consumable product is defined as the combined impression of specific aroma, taste and trigeminal compounds along with entities that evoke mouth feel impressions such as astringency, mouth coating, fullness, etc. Aroma compounds are volatiles that interact with olfactory receptors in the nose evoking a signal to the brain interpreted as smell, while the five basic tastes are elicited by interactions of tastants with specific taste receptors for salt, sweet, bitter, sour and umami tastes, respectively. [0013] In general, out of the many hundreds of chemical entities that are found in natural products, especially those of agricultural origin that may also have been subjected to additional fermentation or prolonged storage, only an order of ten may be responsible for aroma, taste and mouthfeel. State of the art separation, isolation and chemical analysis techniques have allowed the identification and quantification of key flavor compounds out of the many hundreds that may be detected in a natural product. This sophisticated approach, called "sensomics," has been used extensively for food product categories, such as teas and whiskeys. Sensomics can be used to analyze the aroma and/or flavor compounds in sherry wines. [0014] A flavor and/or aroma that mimics exactly the sensory attributes of a certain product by using the same flavor compounds of the natural product is called "nature craft identical" and the combination of chemical entities that mimic the natural product is called "recombinant." Recombinants may be altered or new compounds added to compensate for flavor compounds that cannot be used due to toxicity (not generally recognized as safe (GRAS)) or availability issues and to create new superior flavors. Omissions or additions of certain compounds in "recombinants" have revealed important interplays between aroma, flavor and mouthfeel impressions. This information was used to create the best possible nature craft identical product as outlined in the methods that follow. This approach is primarily based on chemical identification, receptor molecular biology and psychophysics and differs significantly from traditional trial and error artisan creations. [0015] As shown in Figure 1, a flavor system 10 for making a sherry wine-like beverage 14 is provided herein. As used herein, the term "flavor system" describes one or more flavor compounds from one or more of eleven different flavor compound groups having certain flavor characteristics that are in combination within certain ranges to create sherry wine-like beverages. The flavor compounds include those compounds actually found in sherry wines, which have been chemically analyzed to determine the compounds contained therein using sensomics analysis. The flavor system 10 is combined with a liquid base 12 to form the sherry wine-like beverage 14 as shown without the need for aging and fermentation processes usually associated with the making of sherry wines. [0016] As used herein, the term "flavor" refers to taste, aroma and sensation and is thus a mixture of tastants, aroma compounds and sensates. Thus, for example, the beverages formed herein which have the flavor and/or aroma of sherry wine provide a mixture of tastants, aroma compounds and sensates which mimics that found in a traditionally made sherry wine. [0017] As used herein, the term "sherry wine" describes a fortified wine that is mainly produced in Southern Spain. [0018] The flavor system 10 can be mixed with a liquid base 12, preferably water, to create a sherry-like beverage having the flavor and/or mouthfeel of sherry wine, but without the need for fermentation and/or other costly and time consuming measures associated with the production of sherry wines. The flavor system 10 can be in solid or liquid form. Moreover, the flavor system 10 can include compounds from one or more of the eleven flavor and/or aroma groups described herein along with water, ethanol, colorants, dearomatized wine solutions or powders, and combinations thereof. [0019] Dearomatized wine solutions or powders can be obtained by successive distillations of wine so that the volatile fractions containing the odorants are separated from the non-volatile fractions. The non-volatile fractions can then be dissolved in a solvent such as water and/or ethanol or dried to a powder through processes including lyophilization and added as a powder. [0020] The flavor system and beverages made using the flavor system 10 provide several advantages over conventional fermentation and other sherry wine making operations. First of all, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that compounds present in conventionally fermented beverages may be responsible for spoilage, thereby limiting the shelf-life of the conventional beverages. In contrast, the flavor system and resulting sherry wine-like beverages as described herein can be tailored to exclude compounds responsible for spoilage. Moreover, other compounds in the conventional beverages could be carcinogenic. Such compounds, which may provide little flavor, can be excluded from the flavor systems and beverages provided herein. [0021] In addition, the use of the flavor system 10 to form sherry wine-like beverages as described herein allows for quick and easy customization of the beverage as compared to conventional beverages and manufacturing systems. [0022] The flavor system 10 can be altered by substituting or adding additional flavor and/or aroma compounds to the flavor system 10, as described herein. The flavor system 10 can include at least one flavor or aroma compound from each of eleven different flavor compound groups described below. Each flavor group includes compounds which impart a particular aroma, taste or mouth feel. Thus, an adult consumer can purchase or make a flavor system, and create a sherry wine-like beverage having only the flavor notes that the consumer prefers and/or only the flavor notes associated with the preferred sherry wine. The consumer can then add additional quantities of the same flavor and/or aroma compounds or add additional flavor and/or aroma compounds to the flavor system to alter the flavor and/or aroma of the beverage, which mimics the taste and/or mouth feel of conventional sherry wines, if desired. The resulting beverages have the flavor and/or aroma of Fino, Amontillado, Oloroso, Manzanilla, Palo Cortado, Pedo Ximenez, Moscatel, Pale cream, Medium or Cream types of sheny wines. The number of compounds included can be varied based on the preferred type of sheny wine and/or on the type of flavor attributes desired. Thus, the aroma, taste, alcohol content, color and/or mouth feel of the sherry winelike beverage can be altered to suit the consumer. [0023] Various flavor systems 10 having a wide variety of flavors can be rapidly and inexpensively produced and then combined with the liquid base 12 to form the sheny wine-like beverage 14. [0024] In the preferred embodiment, the flavor system 10 includes at least one flavor compound from one or more of each of the following flavor groups: Flavor Group (1): Cheesy, Sweaty Aroma Group; Flavor Group (2): Malty, Buttery and/or Sweet Aroma Group; Flavor Group (3): Floral and/or Honey Aroma Group; Flavor Group (4): Fruity Aroma Group; Flavor Group (5): Smoky, Coconut, Woody Aroma Group; Flavor Group (6): Cooked, Seasoning, Fatty Aroma Group; Flavor Group (7): Phenolic/Medicinal Aroma Group; Flavor Group (8): Sour Taste Group; Flavor Group (9) Sweet Taste Group; Flavor Group (10): Salty and Bitter Taste Group; and/or Flavor Group (11): Astringent, Mouth Feel Group. [0025] In alternative embodiments, the flavor system 10 includes at least one flavor compound from one or more of each of the following groups: (1) Cheesy, Sweaty Aroma Group, (2) Malty, Buttery and/or Sweet Aroma Group, (3) Floral and/or Honey Aroma Group, (4) Fruity Aroma Group, (5) Smoky, Coconut, Woody Aroma Group, (6) Cooked, Seasoning, Fatty Aroma Group, and (7) Phenolic/Medicinal Aroma Group. It is noted that all of the flavor groups including (8) the sour taste group, (9) the sweet taste group, (10) the salt and bitter taste group and (11) the astringent, mouth feel group (Groups 8-11) are not required in every flavor system 10. If desired, the non- volatile flavor compounds contained therein can be replaced with dearomatized wine solutions and powders as described above. [0026] If the flavor system is to be used to form a sherry wine-like beverage which would not include flavor compounds from a particular group as shown in the tables below, none of those compounds would be included in the flavor system 10. The flavor groups can include volatile and non-volatile compounds which can impart certain aromas, tastes and sensations to the flavor system 10 and the resulting sherry wine-like beverage depending on the combination and concentration of the various aroma compounds included therein. The flavor compounds in each group are generally interchangeable with other compounds in the same group. In addition, the flavor compounds in each group can also be interchangeable with other compounds having similar flavor characteristics that are not included in the group because they were either not detected and/or present in the analyzed sherry wine or they were not selected as the most important flavor compounds in the analyzed sherry wine. [0027] Moreover, certain compounds, particularly those in the Astringent, Mouth Feel Group may elicit mouth feel impressions such as tingling, mouth-puckering, smooth, velvety, mouth-coating, etc. In addition, certain compounds may affect the perception of aromas and modulate the perceived aroma intensity. [0028] The compounds included in each flavor group along with a range of the amount of each compound that can be included in the flavor system 10 is shown in Tables 1- 11 below. The flavor system 10 can be mixed together and then combined with a quantity of aqueous solution (e.g., water or a mixture of water, ethanol and colorants) or each compound to be included in the flavor system 10 can be separately added to a quantity of aqueous solution. [0029] As shown in Table 1, flavor group 1 includes seven compounds that can impart a cheesy, sweaty aroma to a beverage formed from the flavor system. The compounds of flavor group 1 are selected from the group consisting of caprylic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, 3-methylbutyric acid, isovaleric acid, caproic acid, decanoic acid and combinations thereof. The range of each compound of flavor group 1 that can be included in a sherry wine-like beverage formed from the flavor system 10 in micrograms per liter of aqueous solution ^g/L) is shown. In addition, each of the flavor group 1 compounds can be substituted for other compounds in the same group or for other compounds having similar flavor characteristics not included in group 1 to achieve a similar aroma.

[0043] By including one or more (e.g., two or more, three or more, four or more, five or more, six or more, etc.) compounds from one or more of the aroma and/or flavor groups as described above, the flavor system 10 can be tailored to provide a flavor system 10 which mimics the flavor and/or aroma of a sherry wine. The choice of flavor compounds and the amount included in the flavor system 10 allows a user and/or manufacturer to adjust the flavor of the flavor system 10 and resulting sherry wine-like beverage 14. Moreover, a more diluted and/or less intense beverage can be formed by adding the flavor system 10 to a larger quantity of aqueous solution, while a more intense flavored beverage can be formed by adding the same flavor system 10 to a smaller quantity of aqueous solution. [0044] Preferably, a beverage having a wine taste and/or mouth feel includes at least one (e.g., at least two or at least three) compound from each of the eleven flavor groups. In some embodiments, a beverage having a sherry wine-like taste includes at least one compound from one or more (e.g., at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine or at least ten) of the eleven flavor groups. [0045] The examples provided below are exemplary and are not meant to limit any aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein. Example 1 [0046] For example, an Amontillado sheny wine-like beverage can be formed by combining the compounds in Table 12 below with water. Table 12 4-ethyl-guaicol 21 sotolone 39 From Group 6 methionol 895 methional 41 From Group 7 4-ethylphenol 69 From Group 8 acetic acid 382.000 tartaric acid 4,973,000 From Group 9 glycerol 5,240,000 glucose 54,300 Ethanol 13,397,000 water 75,597,043 [0047] To compare the beverage of Example 1 with a corresponding Amontillado type sherry wine, the wine was first analyzed using sensomics analysis. The sherry- wine like beverage was formulated as described above and compared to the analyzed wine. [0048] Twelve panelists compared the flavor and/or aroma of the analyzed wine with the beverage formed as set forth in Example 1. The panelists were asked to rate the intensity of several aroma descriptors on a scale from 0 to 7. Each panelist was then able to provide an aroma matching score between the analyzed wine and Example 1 on a scale of 0 to 7, with 0 being different and 7 being very similar. [0049] As shown in Figure 2, the wine formed in Example 1 was rated as being very similar to the analyzed wine, with an overall aroma matching score of 6.

Preferably, the kit includes at least one flavor compound from each of the flavor groups described above. The container is sized to contain the flavor system, sugar, and a predetermined quantity of aqueous solution (not shown). The kit is operable to form a beverage having the flavors and/or aromas of a sherry wine. [0051] The kit can include instructions for combining the various flavor and/or aroma compounds in different combinations and quantities to form a variety of different sherry wine-like beverages. [0052] In this specification, the word "about" is often used in connection with numerical values to indicate that mathematical precision of such values is not intended. Accordingly, it is intended that where "about" is used with a numerical value, a tolerance of ±10% is contemplated for that numerical value.
