FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to methods for treating Frac water and other emulsion wastes comprising water and/or hydrocarbons. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As a modern trend, oil and gas producers have turned to a process known as Hydraulic Fracturing, of “fracing,” in order better develop tight-gas reservoirs in deep rock formations. The fracing process is used pervasively throughout the industry (for example, the Barnett Shale, Marcellus Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation areas in North America) because it is an efficient and economically beneficial process of extracting oil and gas from deep rock formations. During the fracing process, oil and gas producers employ the use of a fracturing fluid, such as water, oil, or acid, in order to improve oil and gas production through wellbore drilling in reservoir rock formations. The fracturing fluid can be used to fracture rock layers and release oil and natural gas stored within the multiple layers of rock. To increase its effectiveness, fracturing fluid often comprises a propping agent used to hold open cracks in rock formations after hydraulic pressure dissipates. By holding open these cracks for an extended period of time, producers can realize increased natural resource yields during the fracing process. The fracing process is typically carried out by injecting large volumes of highly-pressurized fresh water into a well in order to induce structural cracks known as fractures. Prior to injection, the water is generally treated with a friction reducer, biocides, scale inhibitors, or surfactants. The injected water often contains a propping agent, such as sand, to hold open the fractures formed by the injected water to maximize the extraction of the natural resources. Once the fracing process is complete, the fracturing fluid is returned to the surface along with both the natural salt water found in the oil and gas reservoir, and the extracted oil and gas targeted by the fracing process. This combined fluid is often referred to as fracture return water or “Frac water.” Frac water can be susceptible to contamination by virtue of its exposure to bacteria and other pathogens during the fracing process. Accordingly, the Frac water returning to the surface can be potentially dangerous to the environment if it is not recovered and disposed of properly. Moreover, these bacterial and pathogenic contaminates can prohibit a well producer from reusing the Frac water after the initial fracing. This resulting waste can add significant costs to the drilling operation. For example, horizontal well fracturing can use between an average of three to five million gallons of water each time the well is fractured. Without the ability to reuse the Frac water after the initial fracing, well producers must safely dispose of the contaminated Frac water and purchase additional non-contaminated Frac water for subsequent fracing of the well. These added costs can be quite significant considering that wells are often re-fractured multiple times over a period of several years. It is therefore desirable to have a solution for properly recovering, treating, reusing, or disposing of Frac water in order to overcome the problems set forth above. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Embodiments presented herein provide, among other things, an improved method and system for treating Frac water and other emulsion wastes comprising water and/or hydrocarbons. In particular, embodiments relate to the use of Microwave Separation Technology (MST) for treating Frac water at an onsite drill operation, dockside, or at remote, centralized location. Once treated, the Frac water can be reinserted into well drilling sites thus resulting in a significant reduction in the costs associated with the fracing process. Moreover, once treated, contaminates such as bacteria and pathogens can be greatly reduced, thus mitigating the environmental risks typically associated with Frac water storage, transportation, and disposal. Described is an improved method and system for remediating Frac water and other emulsions created during hydraulic fracturing. The system can include a first collection unit adapted to store contaminated Frac water, at least one pumping unit adapted to pump a portion of the contaminated Frac water, and a second collection unit for storing remediated Frac water. The system can further include a microwave separation technology (“MST”) unit, an ultra-violet light remediation (“UVLR”) unit, and a chemical additive unit adapted to reduce contamination levels of the contaminated Frac water. The MST can work alone, or in combination with the UVLR unit, the chemical additive unit, or both, to further reduce contaminations levels of the contaminated Frac water. The system can be deployed at an onsite drilling facility or at a centralized offsite location. By reusing remediated Frac water, entities can realize significant cost savings and better environmental compliance. The disclosure also provides a microwave-enhanced treatment method for Frac water remediation that can include storing contaminated Frac water and pumping a portion of the contaminated Frac water. The disclosure also provides subjecting the contaminated Frac water to a microwave separation technology (“MST”) process to reduce contamination levels of the contaminated Frac water, and subjecting the contaminated Frac water to an ultra-violet light technology (“UVLR”) process to further reduce contamination levels of the contaminated Frac water. The MST process step and UVLR process step can either alone, or in combination, facilitate the process of producing remediated Frac water. The disclosure also provides a microwave-enhanced treatment method for Frac water remediation that can include subjecting the contaminated Frac water to a MST process to reduce contamination levels of the contaminated Frac water. The method can further include subjecting the contaminated Frac water to a UVLR process to further reduce contamination levels of the contaminated Frac water. The process can further include subjecting the contaminated Frac water to a chemical additive process. The method can further include storing remediated Frac water.

The MET system 2 can further include a fluid conduit 14 and a second collection unit 16. The second collection unit 16 can be adapted to store remediated Frac water. The MET system 2 can further include a chemical additive unit 18. In an exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the first collection unit 4 can include a high-capacity collection tank for collecting contaminated Frac water. In other embodiments, the first collection unit 4 can be any type of container of various shapes and sizes that can be adapted to store liquids, solids, or gases. For example, the first collection unit 4 can be a fixed container adapted to remain permanently on an offshore oil drilling facility. In another embodiment, the first collection unit 4 can include a mobile container, such as a storage container coupled to a tanker truck. In another embodiment, the first collection unit 4 can serve merely as a conduit to transport Frac water to another part of the MET system 2. In another embodiment, the first collection unit 4 can store or transport fully contaminated Frac water, partially contaminated Frac water, or remediated Frac water. In one embodiment, the first collection unit 4 can include more than one container. In an exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the at least one pumping unit 6 can include a pump comprising a pump motor adapted to pump Frac water to or from other components of the MET system 2. In one embodiment, the at least one pumping unit 6 can include two pumps: one for pumping Frac water to the MST unit 10, and the other for pumping Frac water from the MST unit 10 to the second collection unit 16. In another embodiment, the at least one pumping unit 6 can include more than two pumps for pumping Frac water to and from various components of the MET system 2. In one embodiment, the at least one pumping unit 6 can include any device for raising, driving, or compressing liquids, gases, or emulsions from one point of the MET system 2 to another. In one embodiment, the at least one pumping unit 6 can pump contaminated Frac water, partially contaminated Frac water, or remediated Frac water. In another embodiment, the at least one pumping unit 6 can include three pumping units: one pumping unit for pumping partially contaminated Frac water, a second for pumping contaminated Frac water, and a third for pumping remediated Frac water. In one embodiment, the fluid conduit 14 can include one or more conduits adapted to transport fluids to one or more components of the MET system 2. Fluids can include any liquids, gases, emulsions, or any viscous substance. In an exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the fluid conduit 14 can include a series of pipes or tubes coupled to one or more components of the MET system 2 to transport Frac water to and from one or more of these components. In an exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the fluid conduit 14 can include a series of pipes coupling the first collection unit 4 to at least one pumping unit 6 to a thermal unit 8. The fluid conduit 14 can further include one or more pipes to couple the at least one pumping unit 6 and the thermal unit 8 to the MST unit 10.

In another embodiment the fluid conduit 14 can include one or more pipes coupling one or more components of the MET system 2 to a chemical additive unit 18. In an exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the thermal unit 8 can include a heat exchanger adapted to heat the Frac water. For example, the thermal unit 8 can be used to heat the Frac water to a minimum temperature of 85 degrees Celsius before the Frac water is received by the MST unit 10. In another embodiment, the thermal unit can be used to either heat the Frac water to a temperature above the ambient temperature of the MST system 2, but less than 85 degrees Celsius. In another embodiment, the thermal unit 8 can be used to cool the Frac water below the ambient temperature of the MST system 2. In one embodiment, the thermal unit 8 can be omitted from the MST system 2 altogether. In one embodiment, the MST unit 10 can be adapted to employ microwave energy to facilitate the treatment of contaminated Frac water. The unique characteristics of microwave energy allow microwaves to facilitate certain physical and chemical reactions. More specifically, microwaves employ a unique establishment of rapidly oscillating electric and magnetic fields that selectively energize strongly polar and strongly charged molecules relative to non-polar and neutral, or less polar and less charged, molecules. Due to its versatility, microwave technology can be employed in a variety of applications to induce these physical and chemical reactions. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,314,157 describes a Microwave-Enhanced Process to Treat Marine Emulsion Wastes. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/340,137 describes a Microwave-Enhanced Process to Maximize Biodiesel Production Capacity. Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 5,914,014, U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,400; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,830 each describes a Method for Processing Crude Oil and Water Emulsions using Microwave Energy. This technology, however, has not been applied to remediate contaminated Frac water. As discussed in greater detail below, the straight-forward application of microwave energy to contaminated Frac water does not necessarily produce an optimized remediation system. However, contaminated Frac water can be successfully remediated by employing a MST unit 10 with optimized power settings alone or in combination with a UVLR unit 12 or a chemical additive unit 18, or both. More specifically, experimental results suggest that a MST unit 10 that emits microwaves at power ranges between approximately 20-60 kW can effectively reduce the contamination levels of contaminated Frac water. Table 1 below summarizes these findings: TABLE 1 Test Power Analyte Result RL Units DF Analylzed Method BOD 0 kW BOD, 1670 1000 mg/l 1 Jul. 27, SM 5 day 2011 5210B BOD 20 kW BOD, 1340 500 mg/l 1 Jul. 27, SM 5 day 2011 5210B BOD 30 kW BOD, 736 600 mg/l 1 Jul. 27, SM 5 day 2011 5210B COD 0 kW COD 3380 250 mg/l 5 Aug. 2, SM 2011 5220D COD 20 kW COD 2230 250 mg/l 5 Aug. 2, SM 2011 5220D COD 30 kW COD 1290 100 mg/l 5 Aug. 2, SM 2011 5220D BOD - Bacteria Oxygen Depletion, COD - Chemical Oxygen Demand More specifically, recent empirical evidence suggests that the MST unit's 10 effectiveness can be vastly improved with the aid of a UVLR unit 12 (employing an ultra-violet technology process), a chemical additive unit 18 (employing a chemical additive process), or both. For example, the result of a particular experiment indicated that the MST unit 10 can be effective to initially eliminate approximately 95% of the contamination levels of contaminated Frac water. However, further experiments suggested that the Frac water's contamination levels will increase, quite unexpectedly, to approximately 50% of its original concentrations after several days of storage at approximately 25 degrees Celsius. In order to rectify these unexpected results, further experimentation revealed that Frac water contamination levels can be reduced to approximately zero by subjecting the Frac water to a UVLR unit 12 (employing a ultra-violet light technology process), a chemical additive unit 18 (employing a chemical additive process), or both, after subjecting the contaminated Frac water to the MST unit 10. In one embodiment, the MST unit's 10 effectiveness can be further improved by employing a thermal unit 8 to heat the Frac water to a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius or greater before subjecting the Frac water to the ultra-violet technology process. In an exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the UVLR unit 12 can be located in a collection unit that is of similar design to the first collection unit 4. For example, the UVLR unit 12 can comprise a modified version of the first collection unit 4 with additional structure for remediating contaminated Frac water or partially contaminated Frac water with ultra-violet light. In one embodiment, the UVLR unit 12 can be coupled to a collection unit of similar design to the first collection unit 4. In another embodiment, the UVLR unit 12 can comprise an ultra-violet light remediation structure adapted to remediate contaminated Frac water or partially contaminated Frac water without requiring a collection unit altogether. In one embodiment, the UVLR unit 12 exposes the Frac water to ultra-violet light through an ultra-violet light technology process. For example, the UVLR unit 12 can expose Frac water to ultra-violet irradiation over a period of several seconds. Alternatively, the UVLR unit 12 can expose Frac water to ultra-violet irradiation over a period of several days. In one embodiment, the wavelength of the light emitted from the UVLR unit 12 can vary within the range of approximately 90 nm to 400 nm. In one exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the MST unit 10, employing the MST process, can first eliminate approximately 95% of the contaminates of contaminated Frac water. Once the contaminates are reduced, the UVLR unit 12, employing the ultra-violet technology process discussed above, can eliminate most or all of the remaining approximately 5% contaminates remaining in the Frac water. In one embodiment, the chemical additive unit 18 exposes the Frac water to one or more chemicals through a chemical additive process. In one exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the MST unit 10, employing the MST process, can first eliminate approximately 95% of the contaminates of contaminated Frac water. Once the contaminates are reduced, the chemical additive unit 18, employing the chemical additive process discussed above, can eliminate most or all of the approximately 5% contaminates remaining in the Frac water. In one embodiment, the chemical additive unit 18 can be used as an alternative to the UVLR unit 12. In another embodiment, the chemical additive unit 18 can be used to supplement the UVLR unit 12. In an exemplary and non-limiting illustrative embodiment, the second collection unit 16 can include a high-capacity collection tank for collecting remediated Frac water. In other embodiments, the second collection unit 16 can be any type of container of various shapes and sizes that can be adapted to store liquids, solids, or gases. For example, the second collection unit 16 can be a fixed container adapted to remain permanently on an offshore oil drilling facility. In another embodiment, the second collection unit 16 can include a mobile container, such as a storage container coupled to a tanker truck. In another embodiment, the second collection unit 16 can serve merely as a conduit to transport Frac water for disposal or reuse in a fracing process. In another embodiment, the second collection unit 16 can store or transport contaminated Frac water, partially contaminated Frac water, or remediated Frac water. In one embodiment, the second collection unit 16 can include more than one container. In one embodiment, the MET system 2 can be implemented on an onsite drilling facility. For example, the onsite drilling facility can include an offshore drilling facility. Alternatively, the onsite drilling facility can include a drilling site located on land. In another embodiment, the MET system 2 can be implemented at a centralized offsite location. For example, the centralized offsite location can include a location that is remote with respect to the drilling site. In another embodiment, the MET system 2 can be implemented across more than one location. For example, the MET system 2 can be decentralized and spread across various locations either onsite or offsite with respect to the drilling facility.

In another embodiment, remediated Frac water can include Frac water that contains 0% of contaminates originally present in the contaminated Frac water. In another embodiment, remediated Frac water can include Frac water that contains more than approximately 5% of the contaminates originally present in the contaminated Frac water.
