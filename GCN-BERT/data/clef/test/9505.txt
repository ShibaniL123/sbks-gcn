Emergency rescue system The invention relates to an emergency rescue system and a container therefore. Systems for rescue and evacuation from height or depth for use on oil rigs, wind turbines, transmission towers etc. are known. Such systems incorporate a rope, cord, tape, web or other elongate load supporting member (collectively referred to hereinafter as rope) and a lifting or lowering device acting thereupon. Such systems generally comprise all the components required to perform the rescue and are stored in a package, box, bag, barrel, drum, case or other containment means (collectively referred to hereinafter as package) which is kept at or near to the location where it will be used. These may be assembled ready to use or separate for the user to assemble as required. Typically they will allow a person to raise or lower another, or allow a user to descend from a height to a lower level. The components will normally comprise a rope, a descender device which controls the passage of the rope and may also provide a lifting function, an anchor strop for attaching the system to a secure point e.g. a roof beam or eyebolt, a harness, edge protector and other associated accessories. If the equipment is needed for evacuation, for example in case of fire, time is critical and therefore equipment which is assembled ready for use is preferable. Equipment which is packed in a bag is prone to tangle and exposed to mechanical damage as such it can be difficult to deploy which wastes time. Equipment which is packed in a box, although protected from mechanical damage may also tangle. Boxes lined with foam, with compartments for different components are known but these are larger and best suited to the storage of individual items, as such, assembled equipment is not easily stored in this way. Bags may be stored in boxes to avoid some problems but this increases the time taken to deploy the equipment. Typically, if the equipment is assembled ready for use, the first component the user needs in order to deploy the equipment is the anchor strop. This will normally need to be located amongst the other components, even if it was packed on top it will often move as the kit is transported. The invention seeks to solve these problems by providing a rescue system in a package which allows the system to be at least partly assembled whilst keeping at least one component required for use easily located and thus rapidly deployed. According to the present invention there is provided a rescue system, at least partly assembled, and stored in a package wherein at least one component is selectively configurable between a stowed configuration wherein said at least one component is spaced from, or securedly affixed to a position spaced from, the other components of said rescue system and an operative configuration wherein said at least one component is released from the stowed configuration. Preferably when in said stowed configuration said at least one component is securedly affixed to the closing means of said package such that the action of opening the package presents said at least one component to the user. Preferably said at least one component is releaseably attached to said package, said at least one component disengaging from said package when the force applied to it exceeds a predetermined threshold. ' â€ž Preferably said package may contain padding to reduce the free movement of the rescue system there within. Preferably said padding is pulled out of said package by the action of deploying the rescue system. The present invention will be described further, by way of example, and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:- Figure 1 is a side view of a typical rescue system assembled for storage. Figure 2 is a side view of a typical rescue system deployed ready for use. Figure 3 is a side view of a preferred embodiment with a substantially rigid container package in an open configuration. Figure 4 is a side view of a preferred embodiment with a substantially rigid container package in a closed configuration. Figure 5 is a side view of an alternative embodiment with a flexible bag package in an open configuration. Figure 6 is a side view of an alternative embodiment with a flexible bag package in a closed configuration. As described in the accompanying drawings a typical rescue system comprises a descender (23) fitted with a rope (24) and an anchor strop (22) with a snaphook (21). In use the anchor strop (22) is passed around a secure point such as a roof beam (26) and snaphook (21) attached back to the descender (23) to form a loop so affixing said descender to the secure point. The user can then attach to the rope (24) by connecting their harness to the rope eye (25) and subsequently descend to safety. The rescue system package comprises a substantially ridged container (1) with a lid (2). Said lid containing at least one section of hook and loop fastening (3) with at least one section of corresponding hook and loop fastening (4) attached thereto. In use the components of the rescue system (21, 22, 23, 24) are assembled and placed inside the container (1), said snaphook (22) being attached to said section of hook and loop fastening (4). When the lid is closed said section of hook and loop fastening (4) remains attached to the lid, said section of hook and loop fastening (4) being sufficiently long to allow said snaphook (22) limited movement within the container. If the system is deployed, the lid (2) is removed from container (1), the hook and loop fastening (4) lifting said snaphook (22) clear of the container and so making it clear to the user which component is required to commence deployment of the kit. The user may then pull said snaphook (21) causing said hook and loop fastening (4) to detach from said hook and loop fastening (3) separating said snaphook (21) from said lid (2) leaving it ready for use. Padding (5) may also be placed in the container to help limit the movement of the components of the rescue system. If the lid is removed and the contents put into use the action of starting to withdraw the contents from the container pushes out said padding (5) such that it is discarded. Said container may also have the lid sealed in such a way that the seal is broken if the lid is lifted, indicating that it has been opened. Additionally said container may contain a moisture indicator (6) such that it can be ascertained if moisture has entered the container without the need to open it. In an alternative embodiment the package comprises a flexible bag (10) with an opening flap (11). Said flap containing at least one section of hook and loop fastening (12) with at least one section of corresponding hook and loop fastening (13) attached thereto. Said snaphook (21) being attached to said section of hook and loop fastening (13) as previously described. 1. A rescue system, at least partly assembled, and stored in a package wherein at least one component is selectively configurable between a stowed configuration wherein said at least one component is spaced from, or securedly affixed to a position spaced from, the other components of said rescue system and an operative configuration wherein said at least one component is released from the stowed configuration. 2.
