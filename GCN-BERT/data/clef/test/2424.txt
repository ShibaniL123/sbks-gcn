BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method to measure, install and fix an object, particular a method to measure, install and fix a toilet seat. 2. Description of the Prior Art Currently, an ordinary toilet seat or a computerized toilet seat to be installed on a flush toilet should make a holder fixed at two mounting holes of the flush toilet with bolts, washers and nuts by a worker using a wrench or a screw driver in an inconvenient or time-consuming course of assembling or disassembling the toilet seat or the computerized toilet seat that may be unseparated in the case of bolts or nuts rusted. In addition, a holder of any toilet seat or computerized toilet seat being available in the market and featuring its particular specifications should be lifted gently to check secure fastening after the toilet seat or the computerized toilet seat was installed on a flush toilet. In order to provide a mounting base of the computerized toilet seat available to any flush toilet made by an unspecified manufacturer, some tolerances have to be designed on a holder's mounting holes for flexible adjustment within certain extents. However, it is possible to open more mounting holes by a user in the case of two mounting holes' positions beyond the tolerances; otherwise, the toilet seat fails to be assembled.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Refer to FIG. 2 which illustrates the present invention of a method to measure, install and fix a toilet seat, comprising a contour measurement device 1 and a toilet seat 3 with a mounting base 31 thereon. The toilet seat 3 with the mounting base 31 thereon in the present invention can be either an ordinary toilet seat 3 or a computerized toilet seat 3, which is taken as an example to present an installation process of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 8, the computerized toilet seat 3 comprises a mounting base 31, a main body 3, a lavatory seat 33 and a toilet lid 34: the mounting base 31 is located at the bottom edge of the main body 3; the main body 3 relies on the mounting base 31 to securely adhere to a fixed surface at the rear part of a flush toilet 2; the lavatory seat 33 links the leading edge of the main body 3 and is sat by a flush toilet user. The contour measurement device 1 can be a transparent medium, a translucent medium or a display unit with a video camera installed: the medium is made from plant fibers or chemical fibers (e.g., paper or cloth) or a plastic material such as plastic fiber, plastic paper, plastic cloth, plastic sheet, and plastic piece. The medium further comprises at least a toilet seat's contour line 11 and at least a mounting base's contour line 12 which are available for the present invention in an embodiment, for example, a first pattern of the present invention in FIG. 1 or a second pattern of the present invention in FIG. 4. Alternatively, the contour measurement device 1 can be a display unit with a video camera installed which refers to the following process: download an image of the toilet seat's contour line 11 by the display unit; turn on the video camera; shift the video camera along a boundary contour of the flush toilet 2; the display unit indicates how the toilet seat's contour line 11 matches the boundary contour of the flush toilet 2 to decide a location of the toilet seat 3. The mounting base 31 to be installed on the flush toilet 2 is separated from the main body at first; the mounting base 31 which is compact in volume and weight can be fixed and positioned at the flush toilet 2 by an installer. In order to measure positions of fixing the toilet seat 3 on the flush toilet 2 and the mounting base 31 of the toilet seat 3 on a fixed surface which is situated at the rear part of the flush toilet 2, an installer who performs installation and positioning may follow steps for measurement, installation and fixing as follows: Step 1: Refer to FIG. 2 which illustrates a contour measurement device 1 comprising a toilet seat's contour line 11 and a mounting base's contour line 12 within the toilet seat's contour line 11. Step 2: Shift the toilet seat's contour line 11 on the contour measurement device 1 along a boundary contour of the flush toilet 2 on which a toilet seat 3 will be installed (FIG. 3 or FIG. 5); refer to the toilet seat's contour line 11 and the boundary contour of the flush toilet 2 as a basis to decide a location of the toilet seat 3 and a fixed location of the mounting base's contour line 12 on a mounting base 31 to be installed. Step 3: Take the mounting base 31 over the fixed location of the mounting base's contour line 12; lower the mounting base 31 and align the mounting base 31 and the mounting base's contour line 12; make the mounting base 31 securely adhere to a fixed surface at the rear part of the flush toilet 2 by way of an adhesive medium 4 at the bottom of the mounting base 31 (FIG. 7). Refer to the contour measurement device 1 made of paper, cloth or a plastic sheet, each of which is based on the transparent medium or the translucent medium. The contour measurement device 1 comprises at least the toilet seat's contour line 11 and at least the mounting base's contour line 12 which are available for the present invention in an embodiment. In Step 2, an installer shifts the toilet seat's contour line 11 some distances at his (her) discretion along a boundary contour of the flush toilet 2 on which the toilet seat 3 will be installed until the toilet seat's contour line 11 locally overlaps the boundary contour (e.g., front side, left side and right side) of the flush toilet 2. If completed, an installer should check that an outline area at the fixed surface, which is situated at the rear part of the flush toilet 2 and overlapped by the mounting base's contour line 12 on the contour measurement device 1, is sufficient and securely adheres to the mounting base 31 or continuously shift the contour measurement device 1 to make sure of the outline area really matching the mounting base 31. Alternatively, the present invention comprises a display unit with a video camera installed as the contour measurement device 1 which is based on an application method as follows: download an image of the toilet seat's contour line 11 by the display unit; turn on the video camera; shift the video camera some distances at discretion along a boundary contour of the flush toilet 2 until the toilet seat's contour line 11 locally overlaps the boundary contour; if completed, check the display unit to verify that an outline area of the fixed surface situated at the rear part of the flush toilet 2 and overlapped by the mounting base's contour line 12 on the contour measurement device 1 has a sufficient size to which the mounting base 31 securely adheres; otherwise, continuously shift the display unit with a video camera installed back and forth to make sure of the outline area with a sufficient size to which the mounting base 31 really adheres. In Step 3, the adhesive medium 4 prepared at the bottom of the mounting base 31 is either an absorber or a glutinous substance. As one medium stuck on the fixed surface within the mounting base's contour line 12 on the flush toilet 2, the absorber has a sunken area centrally which develops vacuum under effect of ambient air and is not separated while adhering to the fixed surface of the flush toilet 2. The reusable glutinous substance mounted at the bottom of the mounting base 31 and developing a certain thickness can be repeatedly stuck at a proper position and prevents the mounting base 31 from damage. The glutinous substance is a thin adhesive which is made from multiple materials such as mineral oil, chemical resin, thermoplastic rubber and antioxidant and characteristic of repeatable paste like sticky notes. As shown in FIG. 9, the main body 32 along with the toilet seat 3 can be placed on the flush toilet 2 on which the mounting base 31 has been installed. Finally, the computerized toilet seat 3 is completely assembled with the main body 32 of the toilet seat 3 and the mounting base 31 properly combined and positioned to each other. Moreover, FIG. 6 is a schematic view which illustrates the ordinary toilet seat 3 installed on the flush toilet 2. Many changes and modifications in the above described embodiment of the invention can, of course, be carried out without departing from the scope thereof. Accordingly, to promote the progress in science and the useful arts, the invention is disclosed and is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. 1.
