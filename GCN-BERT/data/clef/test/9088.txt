BACKGROUND This disclosure relates generally to methods and devices for use in treating various ocular diseases. Glaucoma is caused by a number of different eye diseases which can produce increased intraocular pressure (IOP) in the eye. The increased pressure is often caused by a backup of aqueous humour within the eye. Over time, the increased pressure can cause damage to the optic nerve, which can lead to blindness. One way to treat glaucoma is to implant a drainage device, or shunt, in the eye. The drainage device functions to drain aqueous humour from the anterior chamber and thereby reduce the intraocular pressure. The drainage device is typically implanted using to an invasive surgical procedure. Pursuant to one such procedure, a flap is surgically formed in the sclera. The flap is folded back to form a small cavity and a shunt is inserted into the eye through the flap. Such a procedure can be quite traumatic for the patient. The following references describe various devices and procedures for treating glaucoma: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,827,700 to Lynch, 6,666,841 to Bergheim, 6,508,779 to Suson, 6,544,208 to Ethier, 5,601,094 to Reiss, 6,102,045 to Nordquist, U.S. Patent Application 2002/0156413 to Williams, 2002/0143284 to Tu, 2003/0236483 to Ren, 2002/0193725 to Odrich, 2002/0165478 to Gharib, 2002/0133168 to Smedley, 2005/0107734, 2004/0260228 to Lynch, 2004/0102729 to Haffner, 2004/0015140 to Sheilds, 2004/0254521 to Simon, 2004/0225250 to Yablonski. The aforementioned references are all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Current devices and procedures for treating glaucoma have disadvantages and in some cases only moderate success rates. The procedures are very traumatic to the eye and also require highly accurate surgical skills, such as to properly place the drainage device in a proper location. In addition, the devices that drain fluid from the anterior chamber to a subconjunctival bleb beneath a scleral flap, are prone to infection, and can occlude and cease working. This can require re-operation to remove the device and place another one, or can result in further surgeries. In addition, for agents delivered via direct injection, other complications result, and numerous office visits are required to keep a therapeutic dose resident in the eye. In view of the foregoing, there is a need for improved devices and methods for the treatment of a variety of ocular diseases. SUMMARY Disclosed are devices and methods for treatment of eye disease such as glaucoma. Using the devices and introduction and placement techniques of the present invention, it is possible to place a device using the suprachoroidal space as a conduit within which to place a drug delivery device. One such drug delivery device may be a tube, wicking element, bioabsorbable polymer structure, or other configuration of drug delivery substrate. The delivery device may include a port on the proximal end to assist in repeat injection, and may include a reservoir at some point along the device to either collect flow from the aqueous to concentrate it along the length of the device, or act as a repository for injected agent. In addition, the devices of the present invention may be used to augment and assist delivery of drugs to the back of the eye either through injection into a port of the device, or by directing therapeutic agents placed by drops into the eye, but direction the flow of the aqueous containing the drop, into the suprachoroidal space and beyond, to various locations toward the back of the eye. Placement of a suprachoroidal implant can also assist in delivering drugs to various locations within the eye, including to the back of the eye. Injections to the back of the eye to treat a wide variety of systemic and ocular conditions such as inflammation, infection, cancerous growth, may be prevented or treated using the drug delivery devices of the present invention. More specifically, ocular conditions such as glaucoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, dry and wet AMD, uveitis, keratitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, cystoid macular edema, herpes simplex viral and adenoviral infections can be treated or prevented. In many cases, multiple injections are required, leading to degradation of the injection site, and numerous office visits, resulting in increased cost to the healthcare system as well as issues of compliance with patients. In one aspect, there is disclosed a device for delivering an agent to the eye, comprising an elongate element adapted for at least partial placement in a suprachoroidal space of the eye, the elongate element having a proximal end and a distal end, wherein the proximal end is positioned at a first location of the eye and wherein the distal end extends to a location within a posterior segment of the eye, the elongate element adapted to deliver a drug into the eye. In another aspect, there is disclosed a method of delivering drug into the eye, comprising: implanting an elongate element in the eye such that at least a portion of the elongate member is positioned within the suprachoroidal space of the eye, the elongate member adapted to deliver a drug into the eye; and inserting a drug into the elongate member such that the drug flows along the elongate member into the suprachoroidal space. In another aspect, there is disclosed a method of delivering drug into the eye, comprising: forming an incision in the cornea of the eye; inserting an elongate member through the incision into the eye wherein the elongate member is adapted to transport a drug; passing the delivery device along a pathway through the scleral spur of the eye into the suprachoroidal space; and flowing drug along the delivery device into the suprachoroidal space. In another aspect, there is disclosed a method of delivering drug into the eye, comprising: implanting an elongate element in the eye such that at least a portion of the elongate member is positioned within the suprachoroidal space of the eye, the elongate member adapted to deliver a drug into the eye; placing a drop of a treatment medium onto the surface of the eye; permitting the treatment medium to flow into the anterior chamber of the eye; and causing the treatment medium to flow into the elongate member such that the treatment medium flows along the elongate member into the suprachoroidal space. Other features and advantages should be apparent from the following description of various embodiments, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

FIGS. 5A-5G show various exemplary regions of the eye where a proximal end of the drug delivery device can be located. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional, perspective view of a portion of the eye showing the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. A drug delivery device is positioned inside the eye such that a distal end is located in a location of the eye to which one or more drugs are to be delivered. In an exemplary embodiment, the drug delivery device is positioned in the eye such that one or more drugs can be delivered to the suprachoroidal space. Embodiments of the drug delivery device with various structural configurations are described in detail below. Using the devices and introduction and placement techniques of the present invention, it is possible to place a device that uses the suprachoroidal space as a conduit within which to place a drug delivery device such as the device described herein. One such drug delivery device may be a wicking element, bioabsorbable polymer structure, or other configuration of drug delivery substrate. FIG. 1 shows an exemplary drug delivery device 2910 extending from a point of entry at the scleral spur, and extending to the back of the eye. At least a portion of the drug delivery device 2910 is positioned within and anchored within the suprachoroidal space and can have a profile that is configured to seal within the suprachoroidal space. Another portion of the drug delivery device 2910 is positioned in a different location of the eye. One or more drug reservoir regions 2915 may be optionally formed within the suprachoroidal space for receipt of a drug. The drug reservoir region can be a space or volume within the suprachoroidal space into which a drug is inserted. A proximal end or proximal region 2918 of the drug delivery device 2910 can include a port that receives a drug for delivery into the suprachoroidal space, such as into the reservoir region 2915. With the body of the drug delivery device 2910 being anchored within the suprachoroidal space, the distal end and/or the proximal end of the device can be located at various locations relative to the eye to achieve a desired manner of drug delivery, as described below. The drug delivery device 2910 can have a variety of structures. For example, as shown in FIG. 2A, the drug delivery device 2910 can be an elongate member with an internal lumen for drug delivery. As shown in FIG. 2B, the drug delivery device 2910 can include one or more retention features, such as prongs 2925, that anchor the drug delivery device in a fixed position within the eye. In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 2C, the drug delivery device 2910 is an elongate member with an internal lumen 2927 and an anchor member, such as a flange 2930, located at the proximal end of the drug delivery device 2910. An injection port 2932 communicates with the internal lumen 2927 for injection of a drug. FIG. 2D shows another embodiment of a drug delivery device 2910 that comprises a wicking member without an internal lumen. The wicking member can be formed of a single strand of material or can be formed of a plurality of strands that are interconnected, such as in a twisted, braided, or woven fashion, and through or along which fluid can flow. The wicking member can be a tube that includes an internal lumen that is used to deliver the drug or therapeutic agent directly to the location of the distal end of the delivery device 2910. The wick member(s) do not necessarily include internal lumens, as flow through the wick member can occur via capillary action. In the case of a solid polymer wick, certain surface detents can provide flow lumens between the central body member and the tissue of the suprachoroidal space. The embodiment of FIG. 2D includes a proximal anchor member, such as a flange 2930. Any of the embodiments of the drug delivery device can include anchoring or retention members, such as fenestrations 2912 on the distal end of the device 2910 in FIG. 2D. The fenestrations 2912 can be located at any location along the length of the device. Moreover, any of the embodiments can include one or more valve members that regulate fluid flow. The valve element can cause fluid to collect in a region of the device and then release the collected fluid such as upon a certain pressure threshold. In this manner, a concentrated amount of drug can be delivered into the eye. FIG. 2E shows the drug delivery device 2910 as a wicking member without a flange. With reference to FIG. 2F, the drug delivery device 2910 can include a proximal flange 2930 having an injection port that communicates with a drug reservoir 2940. The reservoir can be filled with a drug or other therapeutic agent such that the drug wicks along the length of the drug delivery device. The reservoir can be re-filled with the drug as needed. The flange 2930 can be positioned at the scleral spur when the device is implanted. The reservoir 2940 is positioned adjacent a leaching body 2940 for drug delivery. A reservoir 2940 can also be located at or near the distal end of the device 2910. In an embodiment, the drug delivery device 2910 is adapted to deliver drops placed on the surface of the eye to suprachoroidal space. This is described further detail below with reference to FIG. 5E. The drug may be delivered to the back regions of the eye, such as regions rearward of the eye equator. One or more drops of a drug or therapeutic agent are placed on the surface of the eye where the drug mixes with the tear film. The tear film directs the drug into an entry port of the drug delivery device 2910. The entry port may be positioned, for example, within the anterior chamber. The drug then flow via the drug delivery device 2910 into the suprachoroidal space and potentially to the back regions of the eye. The drug may mix with aqueous humor as it flows into and along the drug delivery device 2910. In this manner, the drug delivery device 2910 is used to direct drops placed on the eye surface to the back of the eye such as to treat any of a variety of eye diseases. In another embodiment, a punctal plug is used to deliver a drug to the tear film and into the anterior chamber where the drug intermingles with the aqueous humor. The drug delivery device 29210 then delivers the drug into the suprachoroidal space and possibly to back regions of the eye. Pursuant to such an embodiment, one or more punctal plugs are placed in the eye, such as in the corners of the eye. The punctal plugs can be placed in various regions of the eye, such as in the lower two puncta and/or in the upper puncta. One or more drops of a drug or therapeutic agent are then placed onto the eye such that the drug flows into the anterior chamber via the punctal plugs. The drug then flows into an entry port in the drug delivery device 2910 and flows into the suprachoroidal space via the drug delivery device 2910. International Patent Publication WO 06/014434 to Lazar describes exemplary devices and methods for drug delivery through punctal plugs. That publication is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A wide variety of systemic and ocular conditions such as inflammation, infection, cancerous growth, may be prevented or treated using the drug delivery devices of the present invention. More specifically, ocular conditions such as glaucoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, keratitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, cystoid macular edema, herpes simplex viral and adenoviral infections can be treated or prevented. Depending on the dose required, and the delivery profile of the agent delivered, it may be advantageous for the drug delivery device to extend from the initial dissection plane at the point of the scleral spur, within the suprachoroidal space to the posterior segment of the eye, or any location therebetween. The geometry of the drug delivery device may assist in the ability to prolong or control various dosing regimes. For example, a longer delivery device may equate to a longer dosing potential, and similarly a larger diameter device may assist with this also. Because the drug delivery device of the present invention completely fills the suprachoroidal space, a “washout” effect may be minimized, thereby also assisting in the dosing. In addition, it may be advantageous to employ a sealant, to seal any communication between the anterior chamber and the newly dissected suprachoroidal space once the drug delivery device is placed. Products such as Tisseal® (Baxter Healthcare, Irvine, Calif.), fibrin glues, or small amounts of cyanoacrylate may be used for this purpose. Alternatively, if delivery of a therapeutic agent of the present invention is desired in the anterior chamber, or within the sclera, trabecular meshwork, choroid or other structures in proximity to the suprachoroidal space, the entry point at which the delivery device accesses the suprachoroidal space may be varied, such that the distal end of the drug delivery device may be placed in the suprachoroidal space as a means for anchoring the device, and the proximal end (end nearest the outside of the eye) may be placed at the desired delivery location. With reference to FIG. 3, the drug delivery device 2910 can be mounted on an elongate delivery member 525 and can enter the suprachoroidal space at or near the scleral spur. In general, the drug delivery device is implanted using a delivery system by accessing the scleral spur to create a low profile dissection in the tissue plane between the choroid and the sclera. An incision can be formed in the cornea and the drug delivery device is inserted through the incision. The drug delivery device can pass along a pathway through the scleral spur of the eye into the suprachoroidal space. The drug delivery device is then secured in the eye so that it provides communication between a drug delivery inlet and the suprachoroidal space. The drug delivery device 2910 can be positioned within the suprachoroidal space or can have a length such that the distal end of the drug delivery device is positioned at any of a variety of points along the length of the suprachoroidal space, such as any point from the scleral spur to the back regions of the eye. FIG. 4 shows various regions, D1-D6 where the distal end of the drug delivery device can be located. It should be appreciated that the regions are for purpose of example and do not limit where the distal end can be positioned. The proximal end of the drug delivery device 2910 can be positioned at various locations relative to the eye, as shown in FIGS. 5A-5F. In FIG. 5A, the proximal end of the drug delivery device 2910 is positioned at a location P1, which is within the cornea C. In FIG. 5B, the proximal end is positioned at a location P2, which is within the sclera S. In FIG. 5C, the proximal end is positioned at a location P3, which is within the conjunctiva C. In FIG. 5D, the proximal end is positioned at a location P4, which is within posterior chamber PC. In FIG. 5E, the proximal end is positioned at a location P5, which is within the anterior chamber AC. In FIG. 5F, the proximal end is positioned at a location P6, which is outside of the eye. Other locations for the proximal end of the drug delivery device are also possible. Moreover, the locations P1-P4 are merely exemplary and are intended to represent regions of the eye rather than exact locations. The drug delivery device can be removed from the eye after drug delivery is complete. The drug delivery device can also be bioabsorbable so that it does not need to be removed. With reference to FIG. 5G, a container, such as a drop bottle 2970, is adapted to deliver one or more drops 2972 of a drug or therapeutic agent onto the surface of the eye. The tear film directs the drug into the anterior chamber, as represented schematically by the arrows 2976 in FIG. 5G. The drug then flows into the entry port 2960 of the drug delivery device 2910, which guides the drug into the suprachoroidal space. With respect to any of the embodiments of FIG. 5A-5G, the proximal end of the drug delivery device 2910 can include a port 2960 that is adapted to receive a drug. The port 2960 can have various structural configurations and shapes. For example, the port 2960 can be funnel-shaped, flanged, or widened to facilitate entry of the drug into the delivery device. The port 2960 can also be made of a material that is adapted to absorb or otherwise attract the drug.
