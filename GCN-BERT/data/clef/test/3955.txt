Step 4 Synthesis of Compound 125
Compound 124 (1.5 g, 2.74 mmol) and cesium carbonate (2.68 g, 8.22 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (7.5 mL) at room temperature, 1, 2-dibromoethane (0.354 mL, 4.11 mmol) was added dropwise thereto, and the mixture was stirred for 21 hours. Water (50 mL) was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (50 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (50 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was washed with hexane to obtain Compound 125 (1.39 g, 88% yield).
