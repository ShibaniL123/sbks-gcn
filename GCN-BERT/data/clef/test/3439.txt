Step 2. Synthesis of Methyl 6-((2-Methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)methyl)nicotinate (IE8)
To a solution of methyl 6-(bromomethyl)nicotinate (IE7, 200 mg, 0.88 mmol) and 2-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol (IA15, 170 mg, 0.97 mmol) in DMF (20 mL) was added Cs2CO3 (573 mg, 1.76 mmol) and the mixture was allowed to stir at rt for 12 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH4Cl (50 mL) and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with water and brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography (0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford IE8 as a colorless oil (180 mg, 63%).
