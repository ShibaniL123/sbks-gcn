BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to dental implant technology and more particularly, to a sinus implant that can synchronously push the selected amount of bone growth powder/biomedical filler into the crevice between the sinus floor and the upper gum without damaging or piercing the sinus floor. 2. Description of the Related Art In a typically dental implant procedure, prior to installation of the dental implant, the dentist will check the conditions of the gum. If the thickness of cortical bone is insufficient, a bone growth powder/biomedical filler must be supplemented to lift the thickness of the cortical bone. The bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling amount is determined subject to the condition of the patient's dental implant bone area. Thus, a proper implant bone growth powder/biomedical filler thickness can be provided. As illustrated in FIG. 1, if the thickness of the cortical bone (for example, upper gum) 101 in the implant area around the sinus floor 100 is insufficient and must be lifted, the existing method is to make a drill hole 102 in the cortical bone 101 by osteotomy, and then, as shown in FIG. 2, to separate a part of the sinus floor 100 from the cortical bone 101, and then to fill a bone growth powder/biomedical filler 103 into the crevice between the sinus floor 100 and the cortical bone 101 so as to increase the thickness of the cortical bone 101 and to facilitate the follow-up implant installation procedure. During this bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling procedure, the amount of the applied bone growth powder/biomedical filler is determined subject to the condition of the patient's dental implant bone area. When separating the sinus floor 100 from the cortical bone 101, the dentist must carefully perform the procedure not to pierce the sinus floor, avoiding serious sequelae. An early bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling tool for dental implant comprises a push pin 104 at the end of a handle for pushing the applied bone growth powder/biomedical filler 103 from the drill hole 102 in the cortical bone 101 into the crevice between the cortical bone 101 and the sinus floor 100. However, this bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling tool is not convenient to operate. It takes much time to fill the applied bone growth powder/biomedical filler into the crevice between the cortical bone and the sinus floor with this design of bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling tool. Operating this bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling tool is a big burden to the dentist and can make the patient feel uncomfortable. Taiwan Patent M440763 discloses an improved design of bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling tool. This design of bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling tool comprises a bone growth powder/biomedical filler propelling bit that has opposing top end portion and bottom end portion, bone growth powder/biomedical filler transferring grooves spirally extending around the periphery thereof from the top end portion to the bottom end portion, and bone growth powder/biomedical filler propelling threads extending around the periphery thereof at different elevations for rapidly and uniformly propelling bone growth powder/biomedical filler into the space between the sinus floor and the cortical bone to increase the thickness of the cortical bone in favor of the process of the subsequent tooth implanting, helping the doctor in charge of the operation save operating time and physical strength. This design of bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling tool can help the dentist reduce fatigue and shorten the period the patients feel uncomfortable. However, this design of bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling tool is just a simple tool for filling bone growth powder/biomedical filler prior to the implant installation procedure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been accomplished under the circumstances in view. It is one object of the present invention to provide a sinus implant that simultaneously pushes the applied bone growth powder/biomedical filler into place without damaging or piercing the sinus floor during installation. To achieve this and other objects of the present invention, a sinus implant in accordance with the present invention comprises a mounting hole axially defined therein, a plurality of positioning threads spirally upwardly extended around the periphery thereof and gradually reducing in width in direction from a bottom side toward an opposing top side thereof, at least one spiral groove extending around the periphery thereof across the positioning threads, and a pushing tip of reduced diameter located at respective top ends of the positioning threads. The tip comprises a flat end face, and a recess space defined in the flat end face in communication with each spiral groove. Preferably, the pushing tip further comprises a smoothly arched outer guide edge extending around the border of the flat end face, and a smoothly arched inner guide edge extending around the recess space within the flat end face. Preferably, the recess space is shaped like a hemisphere. Further, the positioning threads and each spiral groove can be designed to extend spirally upwardly in the same direction. Alternatively, the positioning threads and each spiral groove can be designed to extend spirally in reversed directions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to FIGS. 3-6, a sinus implant 10 in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is shown. The sinus implant 10 is prepared from zirconium dioxide, comprising an implant root 13 at a bottom side thereof, a mounting hole 12 axially defined therein and upwardly extended from a bottom edge of the implant root 13 to a predetermined height (see FIG. 5), a plurality of positioning threads 11 spirally upwardly extended around the periphery thereof and gradually reducing in width in direction from the implant root 13 toward an opposing top side thereof to form a gum-drilling structure. In this embodiment, the positioning threads 11 extend upwardly in clockwise direction at a fixed pitch. However, this thread extending direction is simply an example but not intended to limit the present invention. Alternatively, the positioning threads 11 can be designed to extend upwardly in counter-clockwise direction. The sinus implant 10 further comprises at least one, for example, three spiral grooves 14 upwardly extending around the periphery thereof across the positioning threads 11 and equally spaced from one another, and a pushing tip 15 of reduced diameter located at the ends of the positioning threads 11 (i.e. at the top side of the sinus implant 10) in axial alignment with the mounting hole 12. The pushing tip 15 defines a flat end face 151, and a recess space 152 in the flat end face 151 in communication with the spiral grooves 14. In order to facilitate pushing and bone pile and delivery in a save manner, the border area of the flat end face 151 is preferably smoothened. In this embodiment, the flat end face 151 has a smoothly arched outer guide edge 153 around the border thereof, and a smoothly arched inner guide edge 154 in the recess space 152. Further, in this embodiment, the recess space 152 is shaped like a hemisphere. However, this hemispherical shape is simply an example. The recess space 152 can also be made in any other geometrical shape for accommodation a bone growth powder/biomedical filler. Referring to FIG. 7, in an upper gum 20 implant surgery, the sinus implant 10 must be driven into the upper gum 20 to push the sinus floor (mucosa) 22 of the sinus 21 for filling a bone growth powder/biomedical filler. During the implant surgery, the dentist fills a bone growth powder/biomedical filler 30 into the drill hole that was made by osteotomy, and then drives the sinus implant 10 into the drill hole. At this time, the design of the spiral grooves 14 of the sinus implant 10 and the design of the recessed space 152 in the flat end face 151 of the pushing tip 15 enable the applied bone growth powder/biomedical filler 30 to be pushed forwards by the sinus implant 10. As the pushing tip 15 gradually pushes open the sinus floor 22, the bone growth powder/biomedical filler 30 is forced to enter the crevice between the sinus floor 22 and the upper gum 20, and thus, the bone growth powder/biomedical filler filling operation is synchronously done when the installation of the sinus implant 10 is completed (see FIG. 8). Referring to FIG. 9, the spiral grooves 14 and positioning threads 11 of the sinus implant 10 in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention extend spirally in the same direction. Therefore, when driving the sinus implant 10 into the upper gum 20, each spiral groove 14 works as a chip discharging channel for expelling upper gum chips or excessive bone growth powder/biomedical filler. This embodiment is practical for a patient who needs a less amount of bone growth powder/biomedical filler to be filled in the sinus floor. FIG. 10 illustrates a sinus implant 10a in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. This second embodiment is substantially similar to the aforesaid first embodiment with the exception that the spiral grooves 140 and positioning threads 110 of the sinus implant 10a of this second embodiment extend spirally in reversed directions, i.e., the positioning threads 110 extend spirally and upwardly in clockwise direction, and the spiral grooves 140 extend spirally and downwardly in counter-clockwise direction. Thus, when driving the sinus implant 10a into the patient's upper gum in clockwise direction, as shown in FIG. 11, the bone growth powder/biomedical filler and cut chips will be wholly forced by the positioning threads 110 into the crevice between the sinus floor and the upper gum. Thus, this embodiment is practical for a patient who needs a large amount of bone growth powder/biomedical filler to be filled in the sinus floor. In conclusion, the invention provides a sinus implant that is not only effective to prevent from piercing the sinus floor in the sinus implant surgery but also capable of synchronously pushing a selected amount of bone growth powder/biomedical filler into the sinus floor when it is driven into position. Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
