BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a draw bar of a luggage case, and more particularly to a handle structure for a draw bar of a luggage case. 2. Description of the Prior Art Luggage cases are mostly provided with a draw bar to be pulled by a user, and the draw bar is usually retractile. As shown in FIG. 1, a conventional luggage case 10 comprises a draw bar 11. The draw bar 11 includes a rod portion 12 which and a handle 13 disposed at the end of the rod portion 12. On the handle 13 is provided a press button 14. The luggage case needs to be put away when not in use, so the rod portion 12 of the draw bar 11 can be pushed into the luggage case 10 and locked therein, which not only saves storage space, but also prevent rupture of the draw bar 11 caused by unexpected collision. The draw bar 11 can also be automatically extended out of the luggage case 10 by pressing the press button 14, so that the user can tow the luggage case. It is to be noted that the draw bar should be pushed back into the luggage case for luggage check in.
