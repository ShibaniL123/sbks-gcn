A solution of [4-chloro-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidin-5-yl]methanol (CAS#1044145-59-6) (2 g, 10.5 mmol), 3-amino-2-methylcyclohexan-1-ol hydrochloride (23c 1.5 g, 11.7 mmol, mixture of diastereomers) and DIPEA (4.5 g, 35.1 mmol) in DMSO (20.0 mL) was heated to 50° C. for 20 h, then poured over ice/water and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×100 mL). The organics were washed with sat. aq. NaCl (3×50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, concentrated, and purified by silica gel chromatography, eluting with 0-100% ethyl acetate in heptane. This method was adequate to separate the desired diastereomer, (±)-(1 S*,2R*,3S*)-3-((5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(methylthio)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-2-methylcyclohexan-1-ol (Intermediate 23, 169 mg, 5.7%, the least polar of the product peaks) as a white solid. The relative stereochemistry was determined by 2-D NMR.
