TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention provides improvement on the solar reflectivity of a black pigment, and more specifically a black pigment comprising a (Cr,Fe)2O3 solid solution. BACKGROUND ART Due to their poor solar light reflectivity, conventional black pigments used on the surface of architectural materials and the like raise temperatures of those architectural materials. Hence, there have been made researches on a pigment (heat-reflective pigment) which can selectively reflect so-called heat rays (infrared light) while maintaining black color by suppressing the reflectance of visible light. The present applicant proposes, in Patent Document 1, that a spinel-type crystalline structure affects selective reflectivity of infrared light, and that a non-spinel type crystalline structure improves to better reflect infrared light selectively. Patent Document 2 proposes a non-spinel type (hematite type) pigment comprising Cr2O3 and Fe2O3 as main components. This pigment has high degree of selective reflectivity in the mid-infrared ray (wavelength: 2500 nm). See also Non-Patent Document 1, concerning the selective infrared light reflectivity (hereinafter sometimes referred to merely as “infrared reflectivity”) of conventional pigments. Non-Patent Document 1 provides a figure showing the characteristics of high-solar-reflectance paints (see FIG. 1 attached to this application), and this document which is relevant to the characteristics of high-solar-reflectance paints is referred to herein by reference. The present inventor has announced excellent infrared reflectance performance of a black pigment comprising a (Cr,Fe)2O3 solid solution, more specifically a black pigment comprising Cr and Fe at a ratio (molar ratio) of (80:20) and forming a non-spinel structure. The characteristics of the black pigment is shown as Comparative Example 2 in FIG. 2. FIG. 1 shows the light reflectance characteristics of both high solar reflectance paints and generic paints in relation to the lightness. In general, the lightness degree of 30 or less exhibits a black color. PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS Patent Documents Patent Document 1: JP 2011-184278 A Patent Document 2: U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,360 (Example 16 and FIG. 4) Non-Patent Documents Non-Patent Document 1: Kogyo Zairyo (Industrial Material), Vol. 60, No. 5, pp. 18-22, FIG. 1 Non-Patent Document 2: Proceedings of Academic Research Society in 2011 in Tokai Branch of the Ceramic Society of Japan, p. 38 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problem to be Solved by the Invention The present inventor has made earnest studies to further improve the selective reflectivity on infrared light, namely a solar reflective black pigment. The applicant has adjusted the molar ratio between Cr and Fe in a black pigment comprising a (Cr,Fe)2O3 solid solution with a non-spinel structure, more specifically, the molar ratio of Cr has been raised. As a result, it has been found that the Cr ratio reaches a saturated infrared reflectance at about 80 mol %; and that a further higher molar ratio of Cr does not increase infrared reflectance, but also decrease while the Cr ratio is between 80 mol % and 85 mol %. Means for Solving the Problem However, as a result of the present inventor's additional studies, it has been elucidated that the infrared light reflectivity improves significantly when the Cr content exceeds 90 mol %. Hence, the black pigment as defined in the first aspect of the present invention comprising a (Cr,Fe)2O3 solid solution, has a ratio between Cr and Fe of (90 to 97):(10 to 3) and having a non-spinel structure. The other aspect of the present invention relates to a pigment having an L* value of 30 or less, the pigment having a ratio between Cr and Fe (molar ratio; the same applies to the entire present specification) of (90 to 97):(10 to 3) and also having a non-spinel structure. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a chart showing the relationship between the lightness and the near-infrared light wavelength solar reflectance in paints. FIG. 2 is a graph exhibiting the relationship between the wavelength and the reflectance in pigments of the Examples and pigments of the Comparative Examples. FIG. 3 shows the relationship between the compound ratio of Cr and the light reflectance. FIG. 3(A) shows the relationship between the combination ratio of Cr and the solar reflectance in an infrared wavelength region; FIG. 3(B) shows the relationship between the blending ratio of Cr and the solar reflectance in a visible ray wavelength region; and FIG. 3(C) shows the relationship between the composition ratio of Cr and solar reflectance in full spectrum. FIG. 4 shows the relationship between the blending ratio of Cr and the reflectance ratio (infrared rays/visible rays). FIG. 5 shows the relationship between the blending proportion of Cr (wide range) and the infrared wavelength reflectance. MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION FIG. 2 presents the relationship between the wavelength and the reflectance when the Cr/Fe ratio is changed in pigments comprising (Cr,Fe)2O3 solid solutions. All of the samples have a non-spinel structure. The Cr/Fe ratio is 50:50 as a Comparative Example (Comparative 1), 80:20 as a Comparative Example 2 (Comparative 2), and 93:7 as an Example 1, 94:6 as an Example 2, and 95:5 as an Example 3. It can be understood, especially from the results of Examples 1 to 3 in FIG. 2, that, when the Cr/Fe ratio is determined to be (90 to 97):(10 to 3), the resultants reflect infrared light (wavelength: 850 to 1000 nm) very efficiently in an area very close to visible light (namely, having high energy). Amore preferable Cr content ratio is a range between 93 mol % and 95 mol %. FIG. 3(A) shows the combination ratio of Cr and the solar reflectance in an infrared light wavelength region; FIG. 3(B) shows the combination ratio of Cr and the solar reflectance in a visible ray wavelength region; and FIG. 3(C) shows the combination ratio of Cr and the solar reflectance in full solar spectrum. FIG. 4 shows the combination ratio of Cr and the reflectance ratio between infrared light and visible light. From FIG. 3(A), it can be understood that the reflectance in the infrared wavelength region remarkably improves in a range of the Cr content ratio above 90 mol %. With the Cr content beyond 97 mol %, the reflectance in the infrared wavelength region improves further (See FIG. 3(A), whereas the visible light reflectance also increases (See FIG. 3(B), so that a black color cannot be maintained. The White circle, “∘” in FIG. 1 represents data on Examples 1 to 3 from FIG. 2 when visible light reflectance is converted in terms of the lightness (L*). From the results shown in FIGS. 2 and 5, it can be understood that the reflectance rate peak near visible light (between 850 nm and 900 nm) contribute to the efficiency of infrared reflectance and that the infrared reflectivity near visible light (wavelength: 850 nm to 900 nm) is saturated when the percentage of Cr content is near 80%. When the content of Cr exceeds 80%, the reflectance peak between 850 nm and 900 nm tends to decrease. Furthermore the infrared reflection efficiency remarkably improves when the Cr content ratio is increased to be above 90%. EXAMPLES The (Cr,Fe)2O3 solid solution used in this invention was obtained by pulverizing and mixing a reagent Cr2O3 and a reagent Fe2O3 in predetermined proportions in a wet manner for 24 hours by means of a bead mill. Those mixtures were dry-disintegrated, and then heat-treated at different temperatures ranging from 800° C. to 1400° C. under the air atmosphere. The heat treated samples were again disintegrated. Constituting crystals were examined on the resultants with an X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) system to confirm that the samples had a non-spinel structure (hematite structure). This X-ray diffraction measurement was carried out in accordance with the method described in Patent Document 1, specifically, using Model RINT2500V/PC manufactured by Rigaku Corporation under the following conditions: target: Cu; voltage: 40 kV; current: 100 mA; and a scan axis: 2θ/θ. Both the visible light reflectance and infrared light reflectance were measured with a spectrophotometer (Model No. Solidspec-3700 manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). In detail, a flat sample was produced by pressing the powders together, and the resultant sample and a standard white plate (reflectance: 990; Labsphere®) were irradiated with a halogen lamp to measure the reflected light with the above-described spectrophotometer. Additional information is that chlorides, nitrates and sulfates of Cr and Fe can be used as starting raw materials. Furthermore, the pigment can be obtained not only from those regents but also from compounds and minerals commonly used for a pigment production. In FIG. 2, Examples 1 to 3 employ a reagent of Cr2O3 and a reagent of Fe2O3 as starting raw materials. The incorporating ratios shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 are based on the ingredient ratios (molar ratios) between the starting raw materials. The molar ratios of Cr and Fe used in the solid solutions are approximately equal to the mixing molar ratios of the starting raw materials. In the above-described example, the solid solution can contain any impurities within a range which does not impair black color and also does not suppress the high selective reflectance to infrared light. Such impurities can include aluminum, antimony, bismuth, boron, lithium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, neodymium, nickel, niobium, silicon, tin, titanium, vanadium, zinc and cobalt. The black pigment of the present invention not only can be used in a paint and a glaze, but also can be dispersed in a base material itself for architectural materials and the like by controlling their grain size. Also, the black pigment can also be applied onto the surfaces of automobiles, ships, airplanes, rockets, various industrial instruments and office supplies or dispersed in fibers. The present invention is not limited to the above-explained embodiment and Example of the invention. Various modified embodiments are also fallen within the present invention within the scope which would be obvious to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of claims. 1.
