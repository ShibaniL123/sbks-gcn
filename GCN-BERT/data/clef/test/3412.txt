Example 94A
1,3-Diethyl-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
Analogously to the method described in Ex. 54A, 500 mg (2.10 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 48A and 252 μl (3.15 mmol) of iodoethane were used to obtain 476 mg (85% of theory) of the title compound The reaction in the microwave was effected here at 60° C. for 60 min, and the MPLC purification was conducted with a Biotage cartridge containing 50 g of silica gel and cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 5:1 as eluent.
