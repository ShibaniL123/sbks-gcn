Synthesis Example 3: Production of Aromatic Amine Derivative (PH3)
In the same manner as in Synthesis Example 2 except for using 4.1 g of the intermediate 10 in place of the intermediate 4 and using 4.6 g of the intermediate 11 in place of the intermediate 5, 3.8 g (yield: 57%) of a white solid was obtained, which was identified as the following compound (PH3) by FD-MS analysis: m/z=664 (theoretical value: 664 for C18H28N2O2).
