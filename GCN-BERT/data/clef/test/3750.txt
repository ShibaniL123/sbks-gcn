Example 40: Synthesis of 4-(4-(4-((1-acetylazetidin-3-yl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-N-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanamide
Step 1: Synthesis of methyl 4-(4-(4-((1-acetylazetidin-3-yl)ethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate
To a solution of methyl 4-(4-(4-(azetidin-3-ylethynyl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate dihydrochloride (Intermediate 4) (800 mg, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (15 ml) was added with Et3N (0.89 ml, 4 eq) and acetyl chloride (0.17 ml, 1.5 eq). The mixture was stirred for 2 hr at 0Â° C., and extracted with dichloromethane and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (560 mg, 75%).
