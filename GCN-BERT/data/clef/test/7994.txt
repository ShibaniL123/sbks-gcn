WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 MICROBIAL PROCESS AND COMPOSITION FOR AGRICULTURAL USE This application claims the benefit under 35 U.SC. i19 of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/355,447, filed June 16, 2010. i0 FIELD OF THE INVENTION Microbial processes and microbial compositions are disclosed that enhance crop production, increase plant defensive processes, decrease the level of plant pathogens and reduce the amount of fertilizer used. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Microbes have previously been used in agriculture. Examples include those disclosed in US Patents 4,952,229; 6,232,270 and 5,266,096. Chitin has also been used in agriculture either as a protein complex (US Patent 4,536,207) or in combination with various microbes (US Patents 6,524,998 and 6,060,429) Chitosan in combination with other components has been used in agricultural applications. See e.g. US Patents 6,649,566; 4,812,159; 6,407,040; 5,374,627 and 5,733,851. It has also been used to treat cereal crop seeds. See US Patent 4,978,381. US Patent 6,524,998 also discloses that chitosan can be used in combination with specific microbes for agricultural use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there is a need to provide improved microbial compositions and processes that improve crop yield and reduce the amount of conventional fungicides and insecticides used in agricultural and horticultural applications. WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Microbial compositions comprising at least two components are disclosed. The first component comprises HYTa which is a consortium of microbes derived from fertile soils and commercial sources. The second component comprises at least one of chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids. The various microbes in HYTa are capable of fixing nitrogen, digesting proteins and other biopolymers such as chitin and chitosan, providing protection against plant pathogens and supplementing the microbial flora of soil. Also disclosed are processes where the aforementioned microbial compositions or their components are used to treat soil, seeds, seedlings and/or plant foliage. In preferred embodiments HYTa is activated in an aqueous solution for 24-168 hours to allow the microbes to grow and reproduce before being used in the process. The conditions of the incubation influence the overall initial properties of HYTa. In a preferred embodiment, HYTa is activated in the presence of chitin. Chitin responsive microbes in HYTa proliferate in this environment. This results in HYTa that has all of the properties of HYTa. However, it has enhanced capability against chitin containing plant pathogens. In a preferred embodiment, the HYTa is activated in the presence of chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids. In this embodiment, after growth, the HYTa may contain residual chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and/or amino acids. Under such circumstances, the culture constitutes the disclosed microbial composition and can be applied directly to soil, seed, seedlings or plant foliage. Alternatively, one or more second components can be added to supplement the second components already in the composition or to change i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 the components present in the thus formed microbial composition. In some embodiments, the activated HYTa is combined with one or more second components and applied to the soil, seed, seedlings or plant foliage or the HYTa and the second component(s) are applied separately. Such second components include chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids. The application of the disclosed microbial formulations allows for the elimination or significant reduction in the amount of fertilizer, fungicide and insecticide used in agricultural applications. In some embodiments, the use of the microbial formulations results in a decrease in the amount of green house gas emissions. Also disclosed is treated soil composition comprising soil treated with HYTa. Also disclosed is treated plant comprising plant treated with HYTa. Also disclosed are treated seeds, seedlings and plants comprising seed, seedling or plant treated with HYTa.

Figure 2 is the same diagram as Figure 3 and shows zones that were compromised and suffered impairment by external factors during the trial. Figure 3 graphically depicts the results from treating the soil and foliage of durum wheat with HYTa and HYTb. Figure 4 shows the yield of melons as a function of size for soil and foliage that was either not treated or treated with HYTa and HYTb. WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 Figure 5 shows the yield of potatoes having diameters greater than 42 mm that were treated with HYTa, HYTb and HYTc as compared to untreated potatoes. i0 DETAILED DESCRIPTION Microbial compositions comprising HYTa and a second component are disclosed. HYTa is a consortium of microbes derived from further soils and commercial sources. The second component comprises at least one of chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids. The various microbes in HYTa are capable of fixing nitrogen, digesting proteins and other biopolymers such as chitin and chitosan, providing protection against plant pathogens and supplementing the microbial flora of soil. The microbial compositions or their components are used to treat soil, seeds, seedlings and/or plant foliage. HYTa As used herein, the term "HYTa" refers to a consortium of microbes derived from fertile soil samples and commercial sources. HYTa was deposited with the American Tissue Type Culture (ATTC), Rockville, Maryland, on May 19, 2010 with an assigned deposit designation of PTA-10973. Table 1 identifies some of the microbes in HYTa that are believed to be responsible for the beneficial effects observed when it is used to treat soil and/or foliage. i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 Bacteria Table 1 I.

These are Azotobacter vinelandii and Clostridium pasteurianum. Bacillus subtilis provides enzymes for breaking down plant residue. Bacillus cereus provides additional enzymes to break down plant residue and penicillinase to decease unwanted bacteria. Bacillus megaterium degrades complex sugars after crop residue breakdown. Lactobacillus provides food for the microbes in HYTa and controls the pH of the environment. The Nitrobacter organisms oxidize ammonia to nitrite (NO2 ) while the Nitrosomonas microbes oxidize nitrite to nitrate (NO3 ). An important property of HYTa is the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. The nitrogen fixing capability of the microbes in HYTa is enhanced by the assistance of other organisms in HYTa. Nitrogen fixation requires that phosphorous (P), potassium (K) and carbon (C) be available. HYTa contains microbes that are able to decompose P, K, and C within the soil. In addition, the nitrogen fixing bacteria provide a source of nitrogen for the other microbes in HYTa. Nitrogen fixation may occur in a non-symbiotic manner by the bacteria Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter, Azotobacter vinelandii, and Clostridium pasteurinum present in HYTa or in a symbiotic manner as occurs in root nodules by way of the Rhyzobium bacteria. The carbon required by the nitrogen fixing microbes in HYTa is provided by the C decomposers which convert the complex organic compounds in soil into simple compounds such as sugars, alcohols, and organic acids. The C decomposers include many of the above identified microbes. Phosphorus is necessary for the nitrogen fixing microbes to proliferate and is obtained from the metabolic activity of the P decomposers which convert immobilized i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 phosphorus in the soil into a bio-available phosphorus nutrient. P decomposers in HYTa include Azotobacter, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Micrococcus luteus. The potassium required by the nitrogen fixers is provided by the K decomposer microbes present in HYTa which activate the potassium from the soil. K decomposers in HYTa include Pseudomonas fluorescens. Three important microbes in HYTa are Bacillus subtilis (SILoSiI® BS) Bacillus thuringiensis strains HD-I and HD-73 (SILoSiI® BT), and Trichoderma harzianum (TRICHOSIL). These organisms are present ATTC deposit PTA10973. They were originally obtained from Biotecnologia Agroindustrial S.A. DE C.V., Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico. Bacillus subtilis ( (SILoSil® BS)is a Gram positive bacterium which is mesophilic and grows at an optimum temperature between 25 and 35°C. It is aerobic and can grow in anaerobic conditions and utilizes a wide variety of carbon sources. It contains two nitrate reductases, one of which is utilized for nitrogen assimilation. It is capable of secreting amylase, proteases, pullulanases, chitinases, xilanases and lipases. Bacillus thuringiensis (Strains HD-I and HD-73 (SILoSil® BT)) are Gram Positive anaerobic facultative bacteria, in the form of a peritrichous flagella. Strains HD-I and HD-73 synthetizes crystals with diverse geometric forms of proteic and insecticide activity during the spore period. Strains HD-I and HD-73 secret exochitanases when in a chitin containing medium and can be utilized for the degradation of the crustacean residues during the production of chitooligosaccharides. Trichoderma harzianum (TRICHOSIL) is a saprophyte fungus. It exhibits antibiotic action and biological i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 competition and for this reason has biological control properties. It produces enzymes that degrade cell walls or a combination of such activities. It produces glucanases, chitinases, lipases, and extracellular proteases when it interacts with some pathogenic fungi, such as Fusarium. As shown above the metabolism of each group of bacteria are closely interdependent and live in a close symbiotic association for the proper performance of HYTa. Besides carbon, hydrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur and various trace elements, a mix of special growth factors, such as B complex, free L-amino acids, and ultra soluble trace elements are important for optimal bacterial growth. Fermenting yeasts are incorporated into HYTa to provide these components. The N2 fixing process requires large amounts of ATP. The amount of ATP naturally present is not enough to fuel biological N2 fixation. The fermentation of the yeast in HYTa compensates for the large energy deficit. During fermentation, organic acids are formed in the respiratory process and together with the phosphorous released by the P decomposers, form ATP. The ATP is used in the biological nitrogen fixation process. HYTa contains enzymes and beneficial soil microorganisms that replace those that have been depleted due to the excessive use of chemicals which results in diminishing crop yields. By increasing the microbial activity in the soil with HYTa, the bacteria causes the nutrients and micro-elements to be absorbed (mineralized) more efficiently and effectively by plants. Humus is transformed by some of the microorganisms in HYTa that impregnate both the soil and the radical apparatus of the plant. This process provides increased nutrition to the plant. This increases the nutrients and the essential i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 i0 PCT/EP2011/059936 elements available in the soil that can be absorbed by plants. The use of HYTa alone or in combination with chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and/or amino acids (i) provides nutrients and elements in the soil that increase crop yields by 25-55%, (2) reduces green house gas emissions, (3) increases the efficiency of mineral fertilizers (3) reduces the use of conventional fungicides and other pesticides, (4) increases the production of plant growth regulators, (5) improves soil structure, tilth, and water penetration and retention, (6) cleans up chemical residues and (7) shifts soil pH toward neutral pH. MICROBIAL COMPOSITIONS HYTa can be used, alone or in combination, with one or more components selected from the group of one or more amino acids, chitin, chitosan and/or glucosamine. In some cases, Acetyl-D-glucosamine can be included in the microbial composition. The microbial composition includes any and all combinations of the aforementioned components. Particularly preferred combinations include: (i) HYTa and chitin; (2) HYTa and chitosan; (3) HYTa and glucosamine; (4) HYTa and amino acids; (5) HYTa, chitin and amino acids; (6) HYTa, chitin, chitosan and amino acids; (7) HYTa, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids; (8) HYTa, chitosan and glucosamine and (9) HYTa, chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids, the latter being particularly preferred. When HYTa is grown in the presence of chitin, chitosan and/or amino acids it may contain residual chitin, chitosan and/or amino acids. Under such circumstances, the HYTa culture constitutes the disclosed microbial composition and can be applied directly to soil, seed, seedlings or plant foliage. Alternatively, one or more of the second WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 il PCT/EP2011/059936 components can be added to supplement the second components in the composition or to change its composition. As used herein, the term "amino acids" refers to a composition containing two or more amino acids. Amino acids include tryptophan, histidine, threonine, tyrosine, valine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, lysine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, serine, glycine, alanine, proline, asparagine and arginine. In preferred embodiments, amino acids are provided by use of HYTb (See below). As used herein, the term "chitin" refers to a biopolymer consisting predominantly of repeating units of beta-l-4-1inked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Chitin is found in the natural environment as a primary structural material of the exoskeleton of animals such as Arthropoda, e.g., crustaceans, insects, spiders, etc., Mollusca, e.g., snails, squid, etc., Coelentara, e.g., organisms such as hydoids and jellyfish, and Nematoda, such as unsegmented worms. Chitin is also found in various fungi including members of the genus Fusarium. Chitin can be extracted from these natural sources by treatment with alkali, or by a biodegradation process. The molecular weight of chitin varies depending on its source and method of isolation. In preferred embodiments, the chitin is derived as a solid from the biodegradation of chitin containing Arthropods as described in the Bioderpac applications. It is preferred that the chitin have a diameter of about 50 to 75 microns to facilitate its application via drip and spray irrigation systems. As used herein, the term "chitosan" is a polysaccharide consisting predominantly of repeating units of D-glucosamine. Chitosan is obtained by deacetylation of chitin. The degree of deacetylation as compared to chitin i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 is preferably greater than 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%. It is preferred that the level of deacetylation be sufficient to render the chitosan water soluble at acidic pH. The molecular weight of chitosan varies depending on its source and method of isolation. Chitosan includes chitosan oligomers. In preferred embodiments, chitosan is precipitated at pH 9.0 from the aqueous fraction obtained from the biodegradation of chitin containing Arthropods such as described in the Bioderpac applications. As used herein, the term "chitosan oligomer" refers to chitosan having 2 or more repeating units of Dglucosamine and, in the case of incomplete deacetylation of chitin, one or more units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. In preferred embodiments, the chitosan oligomers are derived from the aqueous fraction generated in the biodegradation of chitin containing Arthropods such as described in the Bioderpac applications. In some embodiments chitosan oligomers are used as the second component of the microbial composition. As used herein, the term "glucosamine" refers to an amino monosaccharide. In preferred embodiments it is the sugar residue that forms the backbone of the biopolymers chitin and chitosan. Glucosamine is present in the aqueous fraction generated during the biodegradation of chitin containing Arthropods such as described in the Bioderpac applications. Glucosamine induces plants to make chitinase as a defense to chitin containing pathogens. HYTb and HYTc As used herein, the term "HYTb" refers to the aqueous fraction and "HYTc" refers to the solid fraction obtained from the biodegradation of Arthropods such as shrimp waste. derived from the biodegradation or chitin containing i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 Arthropods such as described in US Patent Application Serial No. 61/289,706, filed 12/23/09 entitled "Biodegradation of Crustacean By-products", US Patent Application Serial No. 61/299,869, filed 1/29/10 entitled "Biodegradation Process and Microbial Composition" and US Patent Application Serial No. 61/355,365 filed June 16, 2010 entitled "Biodegradation Process and Composition" each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Briefly, in the arthropod biodegradation process a microbial composition is used to degrade the arthropod or waste components of the arthropod. It is a lactic acid fermentation process. The microbial composition contains microbes that produce enzymes that can degrade the chitin containing components of the arthropod to chitin, chitosan, N-acetyl glucosamine and glucosamine. It also contains microbes that produce enzymes that can degrade proteins and fats to produce amino acids and lipids. A preferred microbial composition for arthropod degradation is referred to as HQE. HQE was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Manassas, VA, USA on April 27, 2010 and given Patent Deposit Designation PTA-10861. In a preferred embodiment, the marine arthropod is a crustacean and the preferred crustacean is shrimp. Shrimp by-product comprises shrimp cephalothorax and/or exoskeleton. In the biodegradation process, it is preferred that the fermentation be facultative aerobic fermentation. It is also preferred that the fermentation is carried out at a temperature of about 30°C to 40°C. The pH is preferably less than about 6, more preferably less than about 5.5. However, the pH should be maintained above about 4.3. The fermentation is carried out for about 24-96 hours. In some embodiments, the fermentation is carried out for about 24-48 i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 hours and more preferably 24-36 hours. These fermentation times are far shorter than the typical prior art fermentation times of i0 to 15 days to achieve substantially the same amount of digestion, albeit without detectable formation of chitosan and glucosamine. The separation of the mixture is preferably by centrifugation. (e.g. about 920 g). Gravity separation can also be used but is not preferred because of the time required to achieve separation. The mixture separates in to three fractions: solid, aqueous and lipid. The solid fraction comprises chitin and is designated HYTc. The aqueous fraction comprises protein hydroysate, amino acids, chitosan and glucosamine and is designated HYTb. The lipid fraction comprises sterols, vitamin A and E and carotenoid pigments such as astaxanthine. It is preferred that HQE be used in the biodegradation process. In other embodiments, it is preferred that previously prepared HYTb be added to HQE or the fermentation broth. As described above, HYTb contains amino acids, chitosan, glucosamine and trace elements including calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron and manganese. HYTb also contains enzymes such as lactic enzymes, proteases, lipases, chitinases, lactic acid, polypeptides and other carbohydrates. HYTb can also contain dormant microorganisms from a prior biodegradation process. Such microorganisms can become reactivated and, in combination with HQE, contribute to a more robust biodegradation process as compared to when HQE is used by itself as otherwise described herein i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 steps : s. b . C • d. e . f . g. h. i. j. More particularly, the process includes the following Activation of the microbial cells in a sugar base solution to enhance its growth and the biomass formation. Milling of the shrimp by-products (cephalthorax and exosqueleton) to make a homogeneous paste. Homogeneous mixing of the shrimp by-product paste with at least 10% of the activated inoculum. Adjustment of the pH values to less than 6.0 in the mixture using a citric acid solution to inhibit the growth of micro organisms and to promote the development of microbial cells that constitute the inoculum. Fermentation of the mixture in a non continuous agitated system at temperatures within a range of to 40°C at least for at least 96 hours maintaining pH at less than 5.0. The pH is monitored periodically. If the pH rises above 5.0, a citric acid buffer is added in an amount to maintain the pH below 5.0. Centrifugation of the ferment to separate the three principal fractions: chitin, liquid hydrolysate and pigmented paste. Rinsing of the crude chitin and recollection of the rinse water to recuperate fine solids or minerals. Drying of the chitin and storage. Drying and storage of the liquid hydrolysate. The pigmented paste (lipid fraction) is stored in closed recipients for conservation. i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 The process and operational fundamentals are better understood with reference to the following detailed description. Activation of microbial cells A microbial composition as disclosed herein is used as inoculum. The inoculum of HQE has a concentration of microbes of about 2.5 to 3.0% (w/v). HQE is activated by dilution to 5% in sugar cane solution (3.75% final concentration of sugar cane), and incubated at 37 °C for days. HYTb (i0 ml per liter of culture) is preferably added to provide a source of minerals and naturally derived amino acids. The cellular growth of the microorganisms was estimated by optical density measured at 540 nm. The activation is complete at an optical density of about 1.7. The concentration of microbes after activation is about 1.9 to 3.0% (w/v). Preparation of samples The shrimp by-products samples are obtained from shrimp processing plants. Slightly thawed and minced residue (1500 g by batch) is mixed with 99 grams of sugar cane (final concentration 6.6% wt%) and 85.5 ml of activated HQE 5% (v/w) (optical density of cell = 1.7). Then the pH is adjusted to 5.5 using 2 M citric acid. Fermentation control The mixture is incubated at 36 °C with a non continuous agitation for 96 h. During the fermentation process, the pH is monitored by using a potentiometer, and the total titratable acidity (TTA, %) was determined by titration with 0.i N NaOH until a pH of 8.5 is obtained. The TTA is expressed as a percentage of lactic acid. Conditions of separation The fermentation product is a viscous silage which has an intense orange color, due to the astaxanthine WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 presence. The ensilage is centrifuged (5 °C) at 1250 rpm (930g) for 15 min to obtain the chitin, the liquid hydrolysates, and the pigment paste. The upper phase (pigment paste) is separated manually. The liquid hydrolysates are separated by decantation, and the sediment that constitutes the raw chitin is washed with distilled water to separate fine solids. The resulting liquid is collected and dried. The raw chitin, liquid hydrolysates and fine solids are dried at 60 °C. All the fractions are stored to protect them from light. Other microbial compositions for the production of HYTb and HYTc are set forth in the following Table 2.

Each of these organisms can be readily isolated from HQE and recombined to form the disclosed i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 microbial composition to degrade arthropods to make HYTb and HYTc. HYTb contains amino acids (about 12 wt%), chitosan (about 1.2 wt%), glucosamine (about 1 wt%) and trace elements (about 6 wt%) including calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron and manganese. It also contains enzymes such as lactic enzymes, proteases, lipases, chitinases among others, lactic acid, polypeptides and other carbohydrates. The specific gravity of HYTb is typically about 1.050-1.054. The average amino acid content in HYTb for certain amino acids is set forth in Table 2. Table 3 Amino acid profile dry powder hydrolysates (mg per g dry weight) Aspartic acid Glutamic acid Serine Histidine Glycine Threonine Alanine Proline Tyrosine Arginine Valine Methionine Isoleucine Tryptophan Leucine Phenylalanine Lysine 36.1 25.8 22.2 16.4 18.3 3.1 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 In some embodiments, HYTb can constitute a second component that is either combined with HYTa or used separately as a soil amendment and/or as a foliage spray. The primary component of HYTc is chitin. It has an average molecular weight of about 2300 daltons and constitutes about 64 wt% of the composition. About 6 % of HYTc contains minerals including calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron and manganese, about 24 wt% protein and 6% water. It has a specific gravity of about 272 Kg/m3. In some embodiments, HYTc can constitute a second component that is either combined with HYTa or used separately as a soil amendment and/or as a foliage spray. HYTa is preferably used with HYTb and HYTc either in combination or separately as a soil amendment or foliage spray. The microbes in HYTa require the trace elements calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, manganese, zinc, molybdenum, iron, copper, sodium, and silicon. These important trace elements can be often obtained from toxic chemical reactions which are not suitable for organic certified products. Accordingly, it is preferred that these trace elements be obtained from an organic source such as HYTb and/or HYTc. Activation of HYTa The aforementioned microbial compositions can be used to treat soil, seeds, seedlings and/or plant foliage. However, HYTa is first activated before use. i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 In preferred embodiments, HYTa is activated by incubating an inoculum of HYTa in an aqueous solution for 24-168 hours to allow the microbes to grow and reproduce before being used in the process of treating soil, seeds, seedlings and/or plant foliage. The conditions of the incubation influence the overall initial properties of HYTa. In one embodiment, an inoculum of HYTa is diluted with water in a ratio of i/i00 and allowed to incubate at a temperature of approximately 36°C at a pH of 6.8-7.1 for about 24 to about 168 hours (7 days). HYTb can optionally be used during this activation. The nitrogen fixing microbes Azotobacter vinelandii and Clostridium pasteurianum proliferate under reduced nitrogen growth conditions. In addition, as the oxygen concentration decreases, Lactobacilli, including Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei, proliferate. The colony forming units (CFUs) for some of the bacteria in activated HYTa are set forth in Table 3: Table 4 Azotobactervinelandii 101,050,000 Clostridium pasteurianum Bacillus subtilis Bacillus cereus Bacillus megaterium Lactobacillus Nitrobacter Nitrosomonas Total Cru/mL i04,275,000 Cru/mL i,i00,000 Cru/mL 25,000 Cru/mL i0,000 Cru/mL 500,000 Cru/mL 5,000 Cru/mL 2,500 Cru/mL 206,967, O00Cfu/mL i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 The HYTa obtained after this incubation retains the beneficial properties of HYTa but is particularly suited as a soil amendment for treatment of nitrogen-depleted soils given the nitrogen-fixation capabilities of Azotobacter vinelandii and Clostridium pasteurianum. If soil pathogens such as filamentous fungi from the genus Fusarium or nematodes are present, or believed to be present, HYTa can be activated under substantially the same conditions but in the presence of chitin. The chitin stimulates the expansion of the chitin responsive microbes such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus thuringiensis, Streptomyces sp., Nitrobacter sp., Micrococcus sp., and Bacillus subtilis. HYTa obtained under these conditions has an antifungal, fungicidal, antinematode, nematodicidal and insecticidal properties to the extent such pathogens contain chitin. Such microbial compositions can be applied directly to the soil or to seed, seedlings and/or plant foliage. Such microbial compositions also have the ability to fix nitrogen as in the aforementioned incubation in the absence of chitin. In addition to incubating with chitin, HYTa can be activated with chitin and amino acids. A preferred source of chitin is HYTc. When HYTc is used the protein and minerals in HYTc are also present during the activation. Further, HYTa can be activated in the presence of amino acids and chitosan. A preferred source of amino acids and chitosan is HYTb. When HYTb is used glucosaime and the other components of HYTb are also present during the activation. Optionally, HYTa can be incubated with chitin, amino acids and chitosan. A preferred source of chitin is HYTc. A preferred source for amino acids and chitosan is HYTb. When WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 HYTb and HYTc are used the other components in these formulations are also present during activation. i0 Use of Activated HYTa Activated HYTa can be used alone or in combination with other components such as chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids to treat soil, seed, seedlings or foliage. In some embodiments, combinations of these components can be applied as a mixture. In other embodiments, they can be applied separately. In still other embodiments, the components can be applied at different times. In one embodiment, activated HYTa can be applied to soil, seeds or seedlings, or used in foliar applications by direct application to foliage. However, when plant pathogens are present, it is preferred that microbial composition comprises activated HYTa, chitin and/or chitosan. Alternatively, the HYTa can be activated in the presence of chitin. Chitosan is known to have bactericidal, fungicidal, and antiviral properties, as well as its ability to stimulate plant growth and to induce plant resistance to pathogens. In other embodiments, glucosamine is a part of the microbial composition In a preferred embodiment, the activated HYTa alone or in combination with chitin (preferably HYTc) and/ or chitin, chitosan, and amino acids (preferably HYTb and HYTc), is applied to soil, seeds, seedlings and/or foliage. It is preferred that HYTa be used in combination with chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids. HYTc is the preferred source of chitin while HYTb is the preferred source of chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids However, the components of the microbial composition namely HYTa, chitin, chitosan, glucosamine and amino acids can be applied separately or in any combination or sub-combination. They i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 can be applied at the same time or sequentially, in any given order. However, the preferred mode of application is to initially apply all at the same time. The application of the foregoing components provide for the direct treatment of plant pathogens, the induction of plant pathogen resistance pathways, and the nourishment of the HYTa microbes, the indigenous nonpathogenic soil flora, and the plant. When soil is initially treated with a microbial composition comprising activated HYTa alone, the microbes present in the composition have an opportunity to populate the soil and to alter its taxonomic composition. In some situations, the initial colonization by HYTa provides little or no nutrients to the plant. In such instances, it is important to maintain a nutrient reserve to sustain both the growth of the microbes while colonizing the rizosphere and the growth of the plants in the soil. It may be necessary to repeat the application of HYTa, depending on the plant's growth cycle and nutritional regime. In other cases, it may be sufficient to provide additional applications of amino acids, chitin and/or chitosan, eg. HYTb and HYTc, to the previously treated soil. When HYTa is used in combination with, for example, HYTb and HYTc, addition nutrients are available to the HYTa microbes and the plants present in the treated soil. Table 5 sets forth a typical fourteen week program for the application of HYTa, HYTb and HYTc to drip irrigated crops cultivated in soil. The values are per hectare. For HYTa and HYTb, the values represent liters per week. For HYTc, the values represent kilograms per week.

For maximum performance of HYTc, it should be applied at the same time as a mixture with HYTa. The protocol should be continued as long as the plant continues in production. This protocol covers all plant stages including germination, root formation, plant growth, flowering, fruit setting, fruit formation harvesting and re-harvest. This protocol is designed for maximum yield potential covering nutritional aspects, biostimulation aspects and protection against diseases such as nematoes and fungi. The process can be carried out by contacting soil to form a treated soil. In some cases the process is repeated. In some cases, plants, seedlings or seeds are already present in the soil prior to treatment with the microbial composition. In other cases, plants, seedlings or seeds are transplanted to the soil after treatment with the microbial composition. In general, before application the number of hectares or acres to be treated is determined. Then the recommended amount of activated HYTa per hectare or acre is multiplied by the area to be treated and diluted in sufficient water to irrigate or spray the soil or crop on the area to be treated. The same procedure can be followed for liquid HYTb. HYTc, being a solid, can be applied directly as a solid or as a suspension in water. HYTc is preferably ground to micron size particles prior to use. WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 The process can be carried out with infertile soil. Such soils generally are those were at least one of low cation exchange capacity, low water holding capacity, low organic matter content and low levels of available nutrients is present. In general, infertile soil does not support vigorous plant growth and/or produces low crop yields. For non-soil systems such as hydroponics, the same protocol applies but with a daily distribution following the ferti-irrigation program. The microbial compositions can be used in connection with any plant including but not limited to alfalfa, banana, barley, broccoli, carrots, corn, cucumber, garlic, grapes, leek, melon, onion, potato, raspberry, rice, soybean, squash, strawberry, sugarcane, tomato and watermelon. When applied as a soil amendment, the microbial composition containing HYTa, chitin, amino acids and chitosan enhances crop production on average about 25%-55% as compared to the 15-25% increase in crop production observed for E2001. From Karl Co. SA de CV, Navojoa, Sonora, Mexico. The microbial composites can also result in a decrease in the amount of chitin used. For example, chitin has been used as a soil amendment in the prior art. Typically, about 600 kg of chitin were used per hectare. However, beneficial effects of such use were not observed for up to six months. When HYTa was activated in the presence of chitin and then combined with chitin and applied as a soil amendment, beneficial effects were observed after seven days with the use of only 4-6 kg of chitin per hectare. Although the disclosure is directed primarily to the use of the disclosed microbial compositions for agricultural applications, such compositions or their components and i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 processes can also be used in horticultural applications to improve the production of foliage and flowers and decrease the use of conventional insecticides and fungicides. When activated HYTa is applied to soil, seed seedling or foliage it forms treated soil, treated seed, treated seedling, treated foliage and treated plants. HYTa is a novel microbial composition. Therefore the soil, seed, seedling, foliage and plants treated with HYTa are also novel. Treated soil is defined as soil that contains one or more microbes that are unique to HYTa dispersed within the treated soil. Such microbes can be detected in the treated soil genetically by using a BioChip that detects microbial populations based on DNA. See e.g. US Patent Publication 2007/0015175, incorporated herein by reference. Other methods, such as PCR, which know to those skilled in the art can also be used. Microbes in HYTa that are particularly preferred are Bacillus subtilis (SILoSiI® BS), Bacillus thuringiensis strain HD-I, Bacillus thuringiensis strain HD-73 (SILoSiI® BT) and Trichoderma harzianum (TRICHOSIL) each of which can be isolated from the HYTa deposit or obtained from Biotecnologia Agroindustrial S.A. DE C.V., Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico. Trichoderma harzianum (TRICHOSIL) is most preferred as it is important during the activation of HYTa in that it causes inter-component synergies among the other microbes in HYTa. Identification of one or more of these microorganisms can be further combined with the identification of other microbes in HYTa, if necessary, to confirm the presence of HYTa or that HYTa was present. Each of Bacillus subtilis (SILoSiI® BS), Bacillus thuringiensis strains HD-I and HD-73 (SILoSiI® BT) and Trichoderma harzianum (TRICHOSIL) were deposited with i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 the ATCC on and given Patent Deposit Designations , and , respectively. Treated seed, seedlings, foliage and plants are similarly defined. In these cases, the microbes of HYTa are found on the surfaces of the treated seed, seedlings, foliage and plants. As used herein, the term "consisting essentially of " in connection with HYTa, HYTb and HYTc means any of HYTa, HYTb and/or HYTc alone or in combination without additional microbes. Example I The following example compares the growth of Persian cucumber plants using HYTa, HYTb and chitosan as compared to a control which was not treated with HYTa, HYTb and chitosan. During the development of seedlings of Persian cucumber, seeds were incubated for three hours in a mixture of 1 liter of water and 250 grams of HYTc. A bag of peat moss and 250 grams of micronized 200 mesh (approximately micron diameter) chitin (HYTc) per bag of peat moss were blended. The seeds were planted in the peat moss/chitin mixture at 18-24°C. The plant development after five days following treatment with HYTc was comparable to 9 days of development without the treatment. The treated and control seedlings were transplanted into 1 hectare of soil in a green house. The HYTa and control soil were treated as set forth in Table WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 Table 6 i iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii i iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii [ iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii i i iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii agricultural soap made from palm and olive oil Nitrogen 150 Kg 280 Kg fertilizer Potash 160 Kg 250 Kg Calcium 80 Kg 130 Kg Phosphorous 200 Kg 320 Kg Magnesium 20 Kg 45 Kg Trace elements i0 liters 22 liters Fungicides 0 20 liters Insecticides 0 16 liters i0 inters 0 i0 The soil containing the HYTa treated seedlings was treated with 2 liters HYTa and 7 liters of HYTb over time. HYTa was diluted in 200 liters of water and activated without the presence of HYTb or HYTc. At week two, one liter of HYTa and three liters of HYTb were applied to the soil and two liters of HYTb were applied to the foliage of the HYT treated plants. There was a significant increase in the yield of cucumbers over the control. The control plants produced 3,000 twenty five pound boxes while the HYT treated plants produced 4,300 boxes. Accordingly, this example demonstrates a significant increase in yield using HYT and a decrease in WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 the amount of fertilizer, insecticides, fungicides and other components otherwise needed. Example 2 Septoria leaf and early blight as well as infection of Roma and beefsteak tomatoes with Phytophthorainfestans can be treated by the protocol set forth in Table 7.

The crop yield was 46 tons of tomatoes per acre as compared to 31 tons per acre for the control. This is a 36% increase in yield. Example 4 Root-Knot nematode Meloidogyne spp. and white mold disease caused by Sclerotiniasclerotiorum were identified as problematic for the growth of carrots. Figure 2A shows the foliage and carrots obtained from such soil. The following protocol was used to treat a hectare. One Kg of HYTc was applied to the soil at the time of transplantation. Two weeks later 1 Kg of HYTc and 1.5 liters of HYTa was applied. Two weeks later 2 Kg of HYTc and 1 liter of HYTb was applied. Thirty days later 1.5 Kg of HYTc, 1 liter of HYTb and 1 liter of HYTa were applied. The root galls caused by the nematode infection was no longer present on the carrots after the treatment. The cottony soft rot caused by white mold was also absent from the carrots after treatment. WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 Example HYTa, HYTb and HYTc can be used to eradicate and control ROYA (Puccinia dracunculina) on Tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus L.). A total of 6 liters of HYTa, 15 liters of HYTb and 900 grams of HYTc were applied to each hectare.

Example 6 This example discloses a summary of tests carried in cooperation with and under the supervision of the Centre International of Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (known and referred to herein as the "CIMMYT") // _ hR 2 : / / www° cimmyt, orgi. This example presents the final data from the harvest of the different treatments. CIMMYT staff performed the collection of samples in accordance with its scientific methodologies and information. These tests were designed to demonstrate the following key benefits of using HYTa alone or in combination with HYTb: (i) the ability to maintain high-performance growth with different regimes of fertilizer and minerals, i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 (2) improving the performance of the system through the use of HYTa or HYTa in combination with HYTb, and (3) the ability to restore soil health soil and increased the levels of fertility through the repeated use of HYT programs. The objective of the test was to determine the effect of the levels of tillage and the handling of straw in two different environments of soils (neighborhood and alluvium), investigate the efficiency of the different forms, types and doses of mineral fertilizers in combination with HYT of Agrinos to make more efficient use of these inputs in order to increase the profitability of the cultivation of wheat to the producer. Areas of test These trials were performed in an agricultural field associated with the assignee which has been used widely for the development of soil remediation products, as well as for the production of cash crops. This agricultural field was treated over the last eleven years with E2001 and related products from Karl Co. SA de CV, Navojoa, Sonora, Mexico and more recently with HYTa and HYTb This area of trials is identified by CIMMYT under the coupon code Z 702 Module Agirnos-CIMMYT and is in the District of irrigation Nf. 38, module 4, section 15, rolls of irrigation 1049-0 and 1115-0. One of the main attributes of HYT TM products is its ability to improve (instead of degrade) agricultural soils with continuous use. In order to demonstrate this attribute of the HYTTM product, the trials have included a test area which was not treated with mineral inputs, E 2001 or any HYT product. The performance of plants of the crop in this area depends entirely on the state of the soil prior to planting.

The designated test was as follows: TRT 5: Biological treatment HYT more 100% traditional mineral fertilization programme: initial application: 1 litre of HYT + 103-52-0 (NPK), second application 1 litre of HYT + 1 litre of HYT B + 61-0-0 (NPK), third implementation 1 liter of HYT B. This further treatment was recommended by CIMMYT in order to observe the behavior of the traditional program of more complete mineral nitrogen program HYT a + b in the performance of the grain of wheat. Only an area of 4 rows was dedicated to this treatment and the information was collected only by CIMMYT staff. A diagram of the test area is shown in Figure 1 where "TRT" refers to the above identified treatment. External factors in the test area Some areas of the test zone were compromised and suffered impairment by external factors. The results of these areas have been excluded from the final results of the harvest to allow a reliable comparison. Reference is made to Figure 2. These external factors were as follows: Area highlighted 1 (Zone i): The wheat variety used is very susceptible to "Chahuistle". Due to the proximity of areas 1 and 5 to high voltage electric lines, the plane could not apply the product on these areas and consequently these areas suffered a higher incidence of the pathogen, causing a significant loss of performance potential. i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 Highlighted areas i and 2 (Zone 2) suffered flooding due to problems of irrigation in the surrounding plots, delaying the planting in 20 days and being affected by the "chahuistle" Highlighted areas 9 and i0 (Zone 3) suffered from irregular irrigation due to the topography of the ground which makes erratic performance of the crop having low and high areas causing non-uniform irrigation that affects the average of the performance.

See Figure 3. This happened without adding any additional element of NPK or HYT during this agricultural cycle given that previous E 2001 and HYT applications had already restored the activity and biodiversity of colonies of benign soil microbes creating high levels of organic matter and nutrients available in the soil. Adding the HYTa and HYTb to the soil-plant cycle system continues the improvement of the capacity of the soil to provide nutrients to plants, increasing the capacity of biological nitrogen fixation. See Figure 3. Various combinations of standard fertilization regimes, alone or in combination with HYTa and HYTb do not seem to improve the results as compared to the use of HYTa i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 and HYTb. This may be due to the existence of sufficient stored nutrients as biomass in the soil from previous years. When the soil and ecosystem have sufficient available nutrients, either through FBN and/or high levels of biomass in the soil, the addition of more (NPK) fertilizer destabilized the biological balance and interfered with the patterns of absorption of nutrients from the plants, possibly changing the capacity of the cultivation of guiding their own nutritional program given the resources available in the soil and active biomass in its roots.

When HYTa was combined with HYTc the yield increase was 5.9 kilo per hectare which is greater than the sum of the results when used separatly. The use of HYTb and i0 WO 2011/157747 CA 02802632 2012-12-13 PCT/EP2011/059936 HYTc resulted in an increase of 2.8 kilo per hectare ahile the use of HYTa, HYTb and HYTc caused an increase of 3.8 kilo per hectare. The greatest increase in grain yield was observed for HYTa, HYTb and HYTc used at the higher doses indicated. This resulted in an increase of over 25% in grain yield over the control, i.e. an 8.3 kilo per hectare increase. Example 8 This example sets forth results of the growth of squash in infertile soil.
