(Step 2: Synthesis of N,N'-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-amino-p-terphenyl)
Into a 2-L conical flask were put 12 g (30 mmol) of 4-(4-biphenylyl)triphenylamine and 1.5 L of ethyl acetate. The mixture was heated and stirred to well dissolve 4-(4-biphenylyl)triphenylamine. After dissolution was visually checked, 11 g (60 mmol) of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) was added and then this solution was stirred at room temperature for two days. After the stirring, the obtained solution was washed with water and saturated saline and then magnesium sulfate was added to perform drying. This mixture was gravity-filtered, and the obtained filtrate was concentrated to give 12 g of a target white solid in a yield of 73%. Synthesis Scheme of Step 2 is shown in (A-2) below.
