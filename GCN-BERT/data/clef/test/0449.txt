Example 34A
cyclobutylchloroformate
Cyclobutanol (1.02 g, 14.15 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) and pyridine (1.2 mL, 14.84 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0° C. with an ice bath. Triphosgene (2.06 g, 6.94 mmol) was added in portions to the well stirred reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 hour and was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stir for an additional 3 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into 1 M aqueous HCl (50 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (3×50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to provide the title compound (1.3 g, 68%), which was used without additional purification.
