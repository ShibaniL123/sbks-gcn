AN OSTOMY POUCH FOR DIRECTING STOMA OUTPUTS AND MEANS THEREOF FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to an ostomy collecting pouch comprising a flexible sleeve for directing patient's stoma output stool and further securing and providing a fluid-tight seal with ostomy skin barrier. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In connection with surgery for a number of diseases in the gastro-intestinal tract a consequence is, in many cases, that the patient is left with an ostomy such as a colostomy, an ileostomy or an ostomy in the abdominal wall for the discharge of the effluents or waste products of the body, which are conveyed through the colon, the ileum or the ureter. The discharge of visceral contents including intestinal gases cannot be regulated at will, and for that purpose the opening may be closed with a closure means, e.g. a tampon or a magnetic closure, or the patient will have to rely on an appliance to collect the material emerging from such opening in the form of a receiving pouch which is later emptied and/or discarded at suitable times. Ostomy appliances are well known. Such appliances may be two-piece or one- piece appliances. In both types of appliances, an adhesive wafer is attached to the wearer's skin. In case of a one-piece appliance, a receiving member or pouch is attached directly to the patient's skin adhesively. In case of a two-piece appliance, the adhesive wafer or barrier forms part of a body side member and a receiving bag is attached releasable to the body side ostomy member for receiving output from the stoma. A stoma is a permanent surgically-made opening that protrudes through a user's skin from the inside of an organ to the outside, generally through the abdominal wall to the exterior, through which the waste material is discharged. A stoma operation is performed to treat serious, often life threatening, diseases and medical conditions such as bowel or bladder cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's Disease), diverticulitis, congenital abnormalities or injury. One consequence thereof is that the patient will lack the ability to control the discharge of urine, fecal material, liquid and/or gases. An opening in one of the sidewalls is adapted to receive a stoma of a patient, from which waste material exits a patient and is collected in the pouch. Ostomy appliances, such as ostomy pouches, are used to receive body waste material by people who have had such surgeries. Conventional collection units include a one-piece or two-piece system. Both kinds consist from a skin barrier and a collection pouch. One-piece units consist of a skin barrier and a pouch joined together. Two-piece systems allow the individual to change pouches while leaving the barrier attached to the skin. These do not require changing the entire unit, including skin barrier, when only the collection pouch is changed while the skin barrier stays intact. When using one-piece appliances, the whole appliance, including the adhesive skin barrier securing the appliance to the skin is normally removed and replaced by a fresh appliance. When using two-piece appliances, the skin barrier is left in place up to several days, and only the collection pouch is replaced. In the treatment of some diseases, a permanent ostomy is made, and the downstream part of the intestines is removed, but where the prognosis is in favor, a temporary ostomy is made and the downstream part is kept intact. In a number of these cases loop-ostomies are made, with an afferent leg carrying visceral content to the ostomy and an efferent leg leading into the downstream part of the intestines from the site of the ostomy, in the same place on the abdominal wall, and thus- the visceral content's normal flow is interrupted at this point - often corresponding to the small intestine - but with further anal continuity via the efferent leg of the ostomy. In other patients a double-ostomy is made which is analogue to the loop-ostomy, but the two parts of the intestine end in stomas placed on the abdominal wall separated with a distance between them. In the process of changing a conventional pouch in a two-piece system the patient has to clean the accumulation of bowel contents on the surface of the skin barrier. Thus arises the need to invent an appliance which eases the changing process and provides a sanitary and convenient solution. There is therefore, a long-felt and unmet need to provide an ostomy pouch which will accelerate the pouch- replacement process in a convenient and secured manner, and further easier and non-repulsive manner.

In another embodiment of the present invention, the sleeve is configured as an integrated connector to the pouch rim thereby, fixedly securing the pouch to the skin barrier and further overlapping the stoma in a fluid occlusive, tight-fit manner preventing accumulation of the ostomy stool in-between the surface of the skin barrier and the pouch. The term "sleeve" refers herein to an elastic and flexible extension having an arcing spring diaphragm-like structure, comprising a first opening portion having a first diameter for connecting to the ostomy skin barrier, a second opening portion having a second diameter; and a middle arcuate flexible elastic portion connecting the first and second opening portions. The sleeve may have a structure selected from the group consisting of conical shape, arcing shape, convex shape, domed shape, rounded shape, curved shape, spherical base shape, cylindrical elastically deformable shape and a combination thereof. The sleeve is with a first opening interconnected to an internal surface of a pouch rimby means of shape and size to seamlessly overlap a stoma, whilst the second opening receives a user's stoma such that the ostomy pouch comprising the sleeve guides and directs the stoma stool and further prevents accumulation into the area between a skin barrier and the collection mounting pouch. In accordance of the present invention, the second opening is with a diameter greater than patient stoma's diameter by about 2 to about 4mm, therefore, the pouch comprising the sleeve does not come in touch with the stoma. The sleeve may be composed from the same material of the pouch, the skin barrier or from another semi-rigid or flexible material, which is biocompatible. As used herein the term "about X" or "approximately X" or "substantially X" usually refers to a range 25% less than to 25% more than of X (X + 25%), at times X + 20%, X + 15% and preferably X + 10. Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which illustrates a sleeve configured by means of shape and size to seamlessly interconnect a pouch thereby forming a one unit collecting pouch. The sleeve demonstrated, is an elastic and flexible sleeve having an arcing spring diaphragm-like structure, comprising: a first opening portion (1) having a first diameter Dl for connecting to the ostomy skin barrier, a second opening (2) portion having a second diameter D2 and a middle arcuate flexible elastic body (4) connecting the first and second opening portions. At least a portion of the middle arcuate flexible elastic body, in proximity to the first opening, is introduced into an ostomy skin barrier. Furthermore, at least the first opening portion is characterized by a stretchable elastic annular sealing film-like region configured to contact and seal the skin barrier in an occlusive and elastic fit and second opening portion is contiguous with the pouch. The conical sleeve comprises a first opening (1) and a second opening (2) for seamlessly overlapping a pouch (3) forming a one integrated unit. The sleeve is elastic and thin in thickness such that easy to be applied upon a subject's stoma without force or creating pressure around the stoma. Furthermore, Dl is greater than said ED-S such that the portion of the middle arcuate flexible elastic body is fixedly secured to said ostomy skin barrier in a tight-fit fluid-occlusive manner. In another embodiment of the present invention, the sleeve further comprises an annulus portion which is a ring-shaped portion bounded by two concentric circles. The flexible elastic area of the annulus is the difference in the areas of the larger circle of radius R and the smaller one of radius r: — ¾ i , ?! T ™ ?j I, h. ■■■■■■■ T I . The annulus portion of the sleeve provides a surface area allowing the sleeve to be affixed to the skin barrier and further providing sealing in a tight- fit manner.
