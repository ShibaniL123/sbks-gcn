(2) The preparation of 1-[(4,5-difluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-t-butyloxycarbon ylamino-piperidine-1-yl]-xanthine
Adding 1-[(4,5-difluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-bromoxanthine (2.3 g, 5.1 mmol), potassium carbonate (1.4 g, 10.4 mmol) and 3-(R)-t-butyloxycarbonyl-aminopiperidine (1.1 g, 5.5 mmol) into a 50ml round-bottom flask, adding 25 mL of N,N-dimethylformamides in, heating to 80Â°C and stirring for 5 hours; after the reaction was completed, cooling to room temperature, pouring the reaction liquid into ice water to precipitate solid, filtrating by air pump and vacuum drying to obtain 2.2 g of yellowish solid, with a yield of 76%. ES-API(m/z):[M+H]+ 568.2.
