Step 2: preparation of intermediate 6-hydroxy-3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (14b)
Under inert atmosphere, phenylsilane (32 ÂµL, 0.308 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (7 mg, 0.006 mmol) were added to a solution of 6-allyloxy-3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (14a) (51 mg, 0.154 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (2 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h and filtered. The precipitate was washed with DCM (2 mL) to give 6-hydroxy-3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (14b) (26 mg, 0.125 mmol, 81%) which was used without further purification.
