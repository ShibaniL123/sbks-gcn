Process Q
SOCl2 (1.5 ml) was added to 2-chloro-4-hydroxy-benzoic acid (5 g, 0.03 mmol) in methanol (10 ml). The mixture was slowly warmed from room temperature to reflux temperature and the reaction solution was refluxed for 12 hours and concentrated under reduced pressure to give compound 132A (red solid, 5.4 g, the yield was 100%).
