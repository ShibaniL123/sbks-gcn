BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An ionic liquid is a class of salt comprising a cation and an anion that is in liquid at a temperature of 100° C. or less and commonly have melting points below room temperature. While not wishing to be bound by theory, ionic liquids generally have much lower symmetry than conventional salts and the charge of cation and anion is distributed over a larger volume of the molecule by resonance in ionic liquids which is thought to contribute to their liquid state at much lower temperatures than conventional salts (e.g. NaCl, mp 801° C.). Ionic liquids are often composed of a cation comprising a heterocyclic ring and a counter anion, often inorganic in nature. The nature of the cation and anion will determine the hydrophobicity, viscosity, density and other physical parameters and properties of the ionic liquid. Ionic liquids have been evaluated as environmentally-friendly or ‘green’ alternatives to conventional organic solvents for a wide range of organic synthetic applications. Ionic liquids have unique characteristics that distinguish them from conventional organic solvents. For example, ionic liquids are non-volatile (i.e. they do not evaporate readily into the atmosphere), they have a high polarity and charge density, they may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, and they have unique solvating properties. As such, ionic liquids are known to be used in cleaning compositions (for example, as disclosed in US 2006/0090777 A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,939,485 B2). A range of ionic liquids are commercially available, or they may be readily synthesized by simple ion-exchange reactions. A biofilm is a structured group of microorganisms encapsulated within a self-developed polymeric extracellular matrix. Biofilms are typically adhered to a living or inert surface. In the human or animal body biofilms can form on any internal or external surface. Biofilms have been found to be involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body and cause a number of conditions including urinary tract infections, middle-ear infections, and in particular, diseases of the oral cavity. Dental plaque is formed from a biofilm precursor, and is present to some degree on virtually all dental surfaces whether in the oral cavity or on dental instruments used by dental professionals. It comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. Plaque may form on any part of the tooth surface, and is found particularly at the gingival margin, and in cracks in the enamel. The danger associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually produce gingivitis, periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease, as well as dental caries and dental calculus. Dental plaque formation is also related to the feeling of a fuzzy tongue in an unclean oral cavity and as such addressing dental plaque formation can address cleaning the tongue. Plaque itself adheres very firmly to dental surfaces and rapidly reforms on the tooth surface after it is removed. Current plaque removal methods rely primarily on the mechanical removal of plaque. These methods, which include brushing, brushing with an abrasive toothpaste, flossing, using interdental cleaners, scraping, using sonic energy (e.g. Sonicare toothbrushes) and ultrasound (e.g. Ultreo toothbrushes), in part, rely on a good brushing or flossing technique which may consumers simply do not possess. Moreover, these methods are particularly inefficient in removing stubborn plaque, or plaque hidden deep within cavities and fissures of teeth, or within gum pockets. It is also known in the art to incorporate antimicrobial agents in oral compositions which destroy or retard the growth of bacteria. However, bacteria present in a biofilm or plaque deposit exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobial agents because the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the bacteria found in the interior of the deposit from the effects of the antimicrobial agents. There is therefore the need to provide improved methods and compositions for removing plaque which mitigate some of the inefficiencies resulting from a poor brushing/flossing technique and which effectively remove plaque hidden between teeth, within cavities and fissures of teeth, and in gum pockets.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It should be understood that the detailed description, and specific examples, while indicating embodiments of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range. As used herein, the words “preferred” and “preferably” refer to embodiments of the invention that afford certain benefits, under certain circumstances. However, other embodiments may also be preferred, under the same or other circumstances. Furthermore, the recitation of one or more preferred embodiments does not imply that other embodiments are not useful, and is not intended to exclude other embodiments from the scope of the invention. As used herein, the term “about,” when applied to the value for a parameter of a composition or method of this invention, indicates that the calculation or the measurement of the value allows some slight imprecision without having a substantial effect on the chemical or physical attributes of the composition or method. If, for some reason, the imprecision provided by “about” is not otherwise understood in the art with this ordinary meaning, then “about” as used herein indicates a possible variation of up to 5% in the value. As referred to herein, all compositional percentages are by weight of the total composition, unless otherwise specified. The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. Ionic liquids are a class of organic salts consisting of cation and anion components with melting points below 100° C. Ionic liquids typically contain an organic cation, such as 1-alkyl-3-methyl-imidazolium or N-alkylpyridinium, together with an anion component that could either be inorganic or organic, for example halides (chloride, bromide), or (trifluoromethyl)sulfonylamide. The physicochemical properties of ionic liquids can be tuned by varying the combinations of ions and by sidechain modifications to the cation component. Ionic liquids are considered “green solvents” due to the fact that they are not flammable, have very low vapor pressures and are recyclable. Certain important characteristics of ionic liquids, such as dipolarity or polarizability, are correlated with their dissolution ability (Lungwitz et. al, New J. Chem, 2010, 34, 1135-1140). In addition to chemical diversity and novelty of potential ionic liquids, their safety and toxicity profile are of great importance. In general, toxicity of ionic liquids is influenced by the length of the cation alkyl side chain and the nature of the anion combination. Aquatic toxicity data for ionic liquids belonging to the 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium (MIM) class towards the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri is well documented in the literature (Ventura et. al., Exotoxicology and Environmental Safety 76, 2012, pp 162-168). A quantitative structure-function relationship (QSFR) model that correlates the activity of ionic liquids with their chemical structures has been developed. Molecular similarity searches using ionic liquids with plaque dissolution properties as input queries have been performed and public domain databases of compounds with a known safety profiles interrogated. A quantitative structure-function relationship (QSFR) model has now been developed to seek correlations between compound properties and their ability to dissolve biofilm. The compound properties considered are a combination of physicochemical properties, including molecular interaction, stereo-chemical and reactivity descriptors. Based on the results of the QSFR model, the property range for ionic liquids with biofilm removal data, encompassing atomic polarizability, kierflex and SMR descriptors, has been used as a benchmark for structure-function characterization comparisons. Four ionic liquids have been used as “first tier” ionic liquids for input to molecular similarity search methodology RAMS (Rapid Assessment of Molecular Similarity). These four compounds are MMMPz MeSO4 (trimethylpyrazolium methylsulphate), EMIM EtSO4 (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulphate), choline salicylate and TMIM MeSO4 (trimethylimidazolium methylsulphate). By using this RAMS approach, it has been possible to identify compounds that are similar to the query molecules in terms of shape, electrostatic potential and lipophilicity but with a different molecular skeleton. Quantitative Structure Function Relationships (QSFR) models are used to build numerical models for molecules with experimental data for prediction and interpretation purposes. In order to build numerical models, it is necessary to represent molecular properties in the form of descriptors. A descriptor can be any quantity that depends on or describes the molecule, such as molecular weight, dipole moment or number of carbon or nitrogen or oxygen atoms. The QSFR model is an equation constructed from a set of molecules (generally referred to as the training set) where a subset (or vector) of the molecular descriptors is used to correlate with experimental results. In general, a linear regression or binary classification method is used to represent the models. The quality of the model can be reported in statistical terms, for example a correlation coefficient or percent accurate term. It is an underlying assumption of the model-building process that the training set is representative of a large sample of molecules, which can be modelled with independent and identically distributed uncorrelated variables. Model quality can be assessed in terms of its predictive ability, usually indicated by its ability to reproduce known experimental results of a test set of compounds (not used in model construction). When data is limited, cross-validation, a procedure by which portions of the training set are left out of the model building and subsequently used to simulate new molecules, is an alternative approach. The process of QSFR model building involves assembling a dataset with experimental results and molecular structures, descriptor calculation and contingency analysis followed by model generation and validations. Ionic liquids with biofilm removal data served as a data set for model generation. The details of the dataset are shown in Table 1 (ID and biofilm removal data for ionic liquids selected for model generation (training set). For MMPZ MeSO4 and EMIM Tosylate, where two values are available for biofilm removal, the value obtained at the higher pH value was considered for modelling work. TABLE 1 ID % removal of biofilm EMIM Cl 44.3 BMIM Cl 43.8 AMIM Cl 44.8 DMIM CL 57.3 EMIM Br 48.6 BMIM MeSO4 53.9 TMIM MeSO4 51.8 BMIMOAc 55.9 EMIM OAc 52.1 MTEOA MeSO4 52.8 BMIM Br 48.0 MMMPz MeSO4 57.8 EMIM Ethyl SO4 48.1 BMIM Octyl SO4 58.6 EMIM diethyl PO4 52.7 EMIM Tosylate 59.5 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (EMIM) chloride (Cl), EMIM bromide (Br), EMIM ethyl sulfate, EMIM diethyl phosphate, EMIM acetate (OAc), EMIM tosylate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (BMIM) chloride (Cl), BMIM bromide (Br), BMIM methyl sulfate, BMIM octyl sulfate, BMIM acetate (OAc), 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium (AMIM) chloride, 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium (DMIM) chloride, 1,2,3-trimethylimidazolium methyl sulfate, 1,2,4-trimethylpyrazolium (MMMPZ) methyl sulfate, and tris (2-hydroxyethyl)methylammonium methylsulfate (MTEOA) methyl sulfate. A number of descriptors representing molecular interaction, stereochemical and reactivity properties were calculated for the dataset of molecules. The descriptor calculation considered both cationic and anionic components of the ionic liquid. The descriptors apol, weight, SMR, kierflex and PMI (atomic polarizability, molecular weight, molar refractivity, Kier flexibility index and principle moment of inertia) were found to correlate with biofilm removal data and were selected for model generation and validation. (The Kier flexibility index for a compound can be calculated from the Kier shape indices (1κα—which encodes information about the count of atoms and relative cyclicity of molecules and 2κα—which encodes information about branching or relative spatial density of molecules and the number of non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule (NSA) using the formula: [in-line-formulae]Φ=(1κα2↓α)NSA [/in-line-formulae] see L. B. Kier, Computational Chemical Graph Theory, D. H. Rouvray (Ed.), Nova Science Publishers, New York (1990)); Todeschini et al., Handbook of Molecular Descriptors, John Wiley & Sons, pgs 177-178, 248-250 (2008). The QSFR model was generated by the partial least squares regression vector method to seek correlations between biofilm removal data for 16 ionic liquids and the four descriptors apol, weight, SMR, kierflex and PMI selected from the contingency analysis. For model validation purposes root mean square errors (RMSE) values and r2 (the correlation coefficient, which lies between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to an ideal fit) were considered. The selected QSFR model is: [in-line-formulae]Activity=31.95+0.32(apol)+0.06(weight)−0.80(KierFlex)+0.22(SMR)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]Correlation coefficient,r2=0.65[/in-line-formulae] The biofilm removal capability is positively correlated to atomic polarizability, molecular refractivity and molecular weight. Conformational flexibility, as represented by the kierflex descriptor, is negatively correlated to biofilm removal capability. Thus we would predict that more conformationally flexible compounds would be less active. In addition to the correlation coefficient r2, measure, the QSFR model was evaluated for its ability to predict the activities of the molecules in the training set. The actual and predicted activity correlated within 5% of each other. Because of the limited size of the dataset, the “leave one out” (LOO) cross validation procedure was used for model evaluation. The correlation coefficient for cross validated predicted activity r2 is 0.35. Three descriptors (apol, SMR, kierflex) were identified from the QSFR model. Their property range for the 16 ionic liquids with biofilm removal data in the training set and the four ‘first tier’ ionic liquids as being 1-ethyl-3-imidazolidium (EMIM), 1,2,4-trimethylpyrazolium (MMMPz), tris(2-hydroxyethyl)methylammonium (Tris-HMAM) and choline. As can be seen, the bulk of the ionic liquids have properties within relatively narrow ranges (30-40 for apol, 5-15 for kierflex and 5-7 for SMR). Comparison of the descriptors apol, SMR, kierflex identified from the QSFR model property profile in known active ionic liquids with the property profile of potential ionic liquids has allowed alternative active compounds to be identified. RAMS-ES (Rapid Assessment of Molecular Similarity-ElectroShape method (InhibOx) was used for molecular similarity search and selections. ElectroShape represents the shape and electrostatics of a molecule as a descriptor that is a compact string of 15 numbers generated from an analysis of interatomic distances and atomic partial charges. Molecules that are similar to a query molecule can be identified by comparison of their ElectroShape descriptors. ElectroShape was used to perform searches across Scopius-CSpace, a database of commercially available small molecule compounds (InhibOx). First, conformational models for reference compounds were generated. Electroshape descriptors for selected conformations were then generated and CSPACE searched for the most similar structures. A visual selection of interesting matches was then made. The input queries were based on low energy conformation for each of the four “first tier” ionic liquids and these were used to provide the input geometries. These ionic liquids were 1-ethyl-3-imidazolidium (EMIM), 1,2,4-trimethylpyrazolium (MMMPz), tris(2-hydroxyethyl)methylammonium (Tris-HMAM) and choline. The cationic component were then enumerated with different anion combinations for subsequent structure function characterization. Chloride, bromide, acetate and methylsulphate anions were selected. In addition, functional groups that increase polarity of the ionic liquids into the sidechain of the cationic component were also proposed. A sidechain length limited to 4 carbon atoms was chosen to avoid possible toxicity due to an increase in hydrophibicity of the ionic liquid. This has allowed new compounds for use in oral care compositions to be identified. The cations identified may be combined with different anions including chloride, bromide, acetate and sulphate. The hits identified from molecular similarity searches were evaluated. Briefly, the highly similar cations (using the RAMS-ES similarity measure) were enumerated with four different anion combinations—chloride, bromide, acetate and sulphate. In the cases of imidazolium, pyrazolium and TRIS ammonium cations, compounds with sidechain modifications were also considered for enumeration with the four anions.

Delivery The oral care composition of the present invention preferably comprises an orally acceptable carrier for use in a product such as a mouth rinse (including dual phase mouthwash), toothpaste, actives in beads/strips, irrigation fluids, plaque removal fluids, Wisp® formulas, formulations to be delivered through devices such as pens, back of a toothbrush and front of a toothbrush, formulations to be delivered through porous wicking materials, interdental brushes, fluid encased dental strips, floss impregnated or coated with the formulations or dried formulations, portables, oral trays, hard or soft candy, lozenge with a soft plaque dissolving liquid inside, lollipops with the plaque dissolving formulation imbedded into the lickable “candy” that can also help control tongue bacteria, peelable gels, patches, formulations for pop-rocks that upon popping, spread a fine mist of the formulation around oral cavity, tongue cleaners with plaque dissolving strips and dental strips. Accordingly, opportunities exist for professional use of the compositions of the present invention (e.g. during cleanings, irrigations, or aggressive periodontal procedures, such as root planning & scaling). The composition of the invention may be provided in any of the products defined herein. If used in animals or pets, veterinary pastes, chewables or treats may also be used as the orally acceptable carrier. In one embodiment, the composition of the invention can be dried into powder and utilized in a portable sachet. For example, upon mixing such a powder with a suitable solvent such as water, a rinse may be created to remove plaque, proteins and other debris in the mouth. In another embodiment, the composition of the invention can be dried with abrasives such as silica, calcium carbonate or soft capsules that upon addition of small amount of water, creates a paste to brush away the plaque. Formulations that increase the substantivity of compounds onto a surface could be expected to increase the efficacy of biofilm, and hence plaque removal. For example, Tween 20 while also functioning as a surfactant, is also a wetting agent. Therefore, incorporation of such an agent could be expected to increase the wettability and spreading of a mouth rinse formulation according to the present invention, over the soft and hard tissue, increasing the formulation's propensity for plaque dissolution and removal.
