4-({[6-(Difluoromethyl)-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
50 mg (0.10 mmol) of the compound from Example 59A were dissolved in 3.0 ml of a THF/methanol mixture (5:1), 0.1 ml (0.52 mmol) of a 5 M lithium hydroxide solution was added and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 3 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was adjusted to pH 1-2 by addition of 4 M hydrochloric acid and purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 31 mg (62% of theory, purity 98%) of the title compound
