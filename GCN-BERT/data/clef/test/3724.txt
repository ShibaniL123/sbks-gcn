Step 5: Preparation of (S)-1-(4-((1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)-2-(methylmercapto)pyrimidine-5-yl)ethane-1-one
376 mg of (S)-1-(4-((1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)-2-(methylmercapto)pyrimidine-5-yl)ethane-1-one was prepared as a colorless oil by using 338 mg (1.0 mmol) of 1-(4-chloro-2-methylmercapto-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)ethane-1-one prepared in step 4 and 267 mg (1.0 mmol) of (S)-1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)ethane-1-amine according to the same manner as described in step 1 of Example 5 (0.66 mmol, yield: 66%).
