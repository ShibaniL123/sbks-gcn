CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/710,844, filed Oct. 8, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT The claimed subject matter was developed with Government support under NIH Grant # GM47969, awarded by the National Institute of Health. Accordingly, the Government has certain rights in the claimed subject matter. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure is generally directed to novel compounds having utility as an anesthetic and/or in the treatment of disorders relating to GABA function and activity. More specifically, the present disclosure is directed to steroids having a 19-alkoxy-17(20)-Z-vinylcyano-substituted tetracyclic structure that are neuroactive and suitable for use as an anesthetic, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. GABA activates two types of receptors, the inotropic GABAA and the metabotropic GABAB receptor. Activation of the GABAB receptor by GABA causes hyperpolarization and a resultant inhibition of neurotransmitter release. The GABAA receptor subtype regulates neuronal excitability and rapid mood changes, such as anxiety, panic, and stress response. GABAA receptors are chloride ion channels; as a result, activation of the receptor induces increased inward chloride ion flux, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition. Drugs that stimulate GABAA receptors, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, have anticonvulsive effects (by reducing neuronal excitability and raising the seizure threshold), as well as anxiolytic and anesthetic effects. The effect of certain steroids on GABAA receptors has been well-established. As a result, researchers continue to pursue the discovery and synthesis of neuroactive steroids that may act as anesthetics and/or that may serve to provide treatment for disorders related to GABA function. For example, it is now widely accepted that the intravenous anesthetic alphaxalone (Compound A, below) causes general anesthesia in humans because it allosterically increases chloride currents mediated by GABA acting at GABAA receptors in the brain. However, the various structural features that enable this compound to function in the way it does have, to-date, not been fully understood. For example, in contrast to alphaxalone, Δ16-alphaxalone (Compound B, below), has been observed to have greatly diminished allosteric activity at GABAA receptors and is not used as an intravenous general anesthetic in humans. The difference in performance of these two compounds, which some have attributed to the presence of the carbon-carbon double bond in the D-ring, has attracted the attention of many researchers. In fact, recently, it was determined that the effect this double bond has on anesthetic activity may depend on the group attached at C-17 on the D-ring. (See Bandyopadhyaya, A. K., et al., “Neurosteroid analogues. 15. A comparative study of the anesthetic and GABAergic actions of alphaxalone, Δ16-alphaxalone and their corresponding 17-carbonitrile analogues. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 20: 6680-4 (2010).) In addition to anesthetic properties, neuroactive steroids may be used to treat disorders related to GABA function. For example, neuroactive steroids, such as progesterone, may be used as sedative-hypnotics, exhibiting benzodiazepine-like actions, inducing reduced sleep latency and increased non-REM sleep with only small changes in slow wave and REM sleep. Further, drugs that enhance GABA responses are often used to treat anxiety in humans. Thus, it might be expected that GABA-potentiating steroids would exhibit anxiolytic effects. Neuroactive steroids may also be used to treat depression, given that accumulating evidence suggests that patients with major depression have decreased levels of GABAergic neurosteroids and that certain treatments for depression alter levels of these steroids. Although GABA is not typically thought to play a critical role in the biology of depression, there is evidence that low GABAergic activity may predispose one to mood disorders. Finally, inhibition of NMDA receptors and enhancement of GABAA receptors appear to play important roles in mediating the acute effects of ethanol in the nervous system, while related studies suggest that GABAergic neurosteroids may be involved in some of the pharmacological effects of ethanol and that neuroactive steroids may be useful in treating ethanol withdrawal. In view of the foregoing, it is clear that there are a number of potentially advantageous uses for neurosteroids. As a result, there is a continuing need for the further synthesis and understanding of new neuroactive steroids, particularly those having utility as an anesthetic and/or in the treatment of a disorder relating to GABA function and activity.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the present disclosure, it has been discovered that compounds having a 17(20)-Z-vinylcyano-substituted steroid structure, more specifically a 19-alkoxy-17(20)-Z-vinylcyano-substituted steroid structure, and even more specifically a 19-methoxy-17(20)-Z-vinylcyano-substituted steroid structure, are neuroactive and are also suitable for use as anesthetics and in the treatment of disorders associated with GABA function, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof. The compounds may be used, for example, as an effective continuous infusion sedative for non-surgical procedures (e.g., colonoscopy). The compounds also offer advantages over anesthetics known in the art, such as a lower likelihood for bacterial contamination, as well as an improved relationship with solubilizing agents. 1. STEROID STRUCTURE Generally speaking, the steroid of the present disclosure has a tetracyclic, fused ring structure, such as a cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene ring system (an embodiment of which is illustrated and discussed in greater detail below), wherein the C3-position of the A ring has a hydroxyl substituent in the α-position, and the C17-position of the D ring has a vinyl-cyano (e.g., ═CH(CN)) group, preferably in the Z-configuration, attached thereto. Notably, and as further detailed herein below, it has surprisingly been discovered that the activity of the steroids of the present disclosure are at least in part a function of the orientation or configuration of the carbon-carbon double bond of which C17 is a part. More specifically, and as further illustrated below, it has been discovered that when this carbon-carbon double bond is in the Z-configuration (or cis-configuration), and further when the CN group is on the C13 side of the molecule, the activity of the compound is notably higher, as compared to the alternative configuration (i.e., when the CN group is on the C16 side of the molecule). For example, comparison of the IC50 values of the Compound 6a (the Z isomer) with Compound 6b (the E isomer) indicates that interchanging the relative positions of the C-20 substituents (H, CN) has a large effect on [35S]-TBPS displacement potency. Compound 6a was about 17-fold more potent at displacing [35S]-TBPS than Compound 6b. A comparison of the IC50 values for Compounds 6a, 6b and 5c shows the effect that hydrogenation of the Δ17(20) double bond present in Compound 6a and 6b has on binding potency. The change in conformation of the D-ring and the loss of the steric restraint imposed by the Δ17(20) double bond increased the IC50 value of Compound 5c about eight-fold relative to Compound 6a, and decreased the IC50 value about twofold relative to Compound 6b. This disparity in displacement potency between Z and E isomers has also been observed in other 17-vinylcyano compounds studied, the Z isomer being about 10- to 20-fold more potent than the E isomer.

Dosage from administration by these routes may be continuous or intermittent, depending, for example, upon the patient's physiological condition, whether the purpose of the administration is therapeutic or prophylactic, and other factors known to and assessable by a skilled practitioner. Those with ordinary skill in administering anesthetics can readily determine dosage and regimens for the administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure or titrating to an effective dosage for use in treating insomnia, mood disorders, convulsive disorders, anxiety or symptoms of ethanol withdrawal. It is understood that the dosage of the compounds will be dependent upon the age, sex, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired. For any mode of administration, the actual amount of compound delivered, as well as the dosing schedule necessary to achieve the advantageous effects described herein, will also depend, in part, on such factors as the bioavailability of the compound, the disorder being treated, the desired therapeutic dose, and other factors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art. The dose administered to an animal, particularly a human, in the context of the present disclosure should be sufficient to affect the desired therapeutic response in the animal over a reasonable period of time. Preferably, an effective amount of the compound, whether administered orally or by another route, is any amount that would result in a desired therapeutic response when administered by that route. The dosage may vary depending on the dosing schedule, which can be adjusted as necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. The most preferred dosage will be tailored to the individual subject, as is understood and determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation. In one embodiment, solutions for oral administration are prepared by dissolving the compound in any pharmaceutically acceptable solvent capable of dissolving a compound (e.g., ethanol or methylene chloride) to form a solution. An appropriate volume of a carrier which is a solution, such as beta-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin, is added to the solution while stirring to form a pharmaceutically acceptable solution for oral administration to a patient. If desired, such solutions can be formulated to contain a minimal amount of, or to be free of, ethanol, which is known in the art to cause adverse physiological effects when administered at certain concentrations in oral formulations. In another embodiment, powders or tablets for oral administration are prepared by dissolving a compound in any pharmaceutically acceptable solvent capable of dissolving the compound (e.g., ethanol or methylene chloride) to form a solution. The solvent can optionally be capable of evaporating when the solution is dried under vacuum. An additional carrier can be added to the solution prior to drying, such as beta-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin. The resulting solution is dried under vacuum to form a glass. The glass is then mixed with a binder to form a powder. The powder can be mixed with fillers or other conventional tabletting agents and processed to form a tablet for oral administration to a patient. The powder can also be added to any liquid carrier as described above to form a solution, emulsion, suspension or the like for oral administration. Emulsions for parenteral administration can be prepared by dissolving a compound in any pharmaceutically acceptable solvent capable of dissolving the compound (e.g., ethanol or methylene chloride) to form a solution. An appropriate volume of a carrier which is an emulsion, such as Liposyn® II or Liposyn® III emulsions, is added to the solution while stirring to form a pharmaceutically acceptable emulsion for parenteral administration to a patient. Solutions for parenteral administration can be prepared by dissolving a compound in any pharmaceutically acceptable solvent capable of dissolving the compound (e.g., ethanol or methylene chloride) to form a solution. An appropriate volume of a carrier which is a solution, such as beta-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin, is added to the solution while stirring to form a pharmaceutically acceptable solution for parenteral administration to a patient. If desired, the emulsions or solutions described above for oral or parenteral administration can be packaged in IV bags, vials or other conventional containers in concentrated form and diluted with any pharmaceutically acceptable liquid, such as saline, to form an acceptable concentration prior to use as is known in the art.

DEFINITIONS The term “steroid” as used herein describes an organic compound containing in its chemical nucleus the cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene ring system. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, Berge et al., describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66, 1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and N+(C1-4alkyl)4 salts. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, lower alkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate. The term “prodrug” as used herein describes a pharmacological substance that is administered in a less active or inactive form. After administration, a prodrug is metabolized in vivo e.g., via hydrolysis, oxidation, or reaction under biological conditions (in vitro or in vivo), to provide an active metabolite. See, e.g., Wu, Pharmaceuticals (2009) 2:77-81. In certain embodiments, a prodrug has improved physical and/or delivery properties over the parent compound. Prodrugs are typically designed to enhance pharmaceutically and/or pharmacokinetically based properties associated with the parent compound. The advantage of a prodrug can lie in its physical properties, such as enhanced water solubility for parenteral administration at physiological pH compared to the parent compound, or it enhances absorption from the digestive tract or the skin, or it may enhance drug stability for long-term storage. As used herein, a “subject” to which administration is contemplated includes, but is not limited to, mammals, e.g., humans (i.e., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric subject (e.g., child, adolescent) or adult subject (e.g., young adult, middle-aged adult or senior adult)), other primates (e.g., cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys) and commercially relevant mammals such as cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, cats, and/or dogs. In any aspect and/or embodiment of the invention, the subject is a human. As used herein, a “therapeutically effective amount” “an amount sufficient” or “sufficient amount” of a compound means the level, amount or concentration of the compound required for a desired biological response, e.g., analgesia. The term “saturated” as used herein describes the state in which all available valence bonds of an atom (especially carbon) are attached to other atoms. The term “unsaturated” as used herein describes the state in which not all available valence bonds along the alkyl chain are satisfied; in such compounds the extra bonds usually form double or triple bonds (chiefly with carbon).

General Methods The compounds discussed in the present disclosure were produced as discussed elsewhere throughout this disclosure and by the following methods. Solvents were either used as purchased or dried and purified by standard methodology. Extraction solvents were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and after filtration, removed on a rotary evaporator. Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel (32-63 μm) purchased from Scientific Adsorbents (Atlanta, Ga.). Melting points were determined on a Kofler micro hot stage and are uncorrected. FT-IR spectra were recorded as films on a NaCl plate. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 at ambient temperature at 300 MHz (1H) or 74 MHz (13C).
