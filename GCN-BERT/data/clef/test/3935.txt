CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application is a Divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 12/539,730, filed Aug. 12, 2009, which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/092,794, filed Aug. 29, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to surgical clip appliers and, more particularly, to a novel endoscopic surgical clip applier. 2. Background of Related Art Endoscopic staplers and clip appliers are known in the art and are used for a number of distinct and useful surgical procedures. In the case of a laparoscopic surgical procedure, access to the interior of an abdomen is achieved through narrow tubes or cannulas inserted through a small entrance incision in the skin. Minimally invasive procedures performed elsewhere in the body are often generally referred to as endoscopic procedures. Typically, a tube or cannula device is extended into the patient's body through the entrance incision to provide an access port. The port allows the surgeon to insert a number of different surgical instruments therethrough using a trocar and for performing surgical procedures far removed from the incision. During a majority of these procedures, the surgeon must often terminate the flow of blood or another fluid through one or more vessels. The surgeon will often apply a surgical clip to a blood vessel or another duct to prevent the flow of body fluids therethrough during the procedure. An endoscopic clip applier is known in the art for applying a single clip during an entry to the body cavity. Such single clip appliers are typically fabricated from a biocompatible material and are usually compressed over a vessel. Once applied to the vessel, the compressed clip terminates the flow of fluid therethrough. Endoscopic clip appliers that are able to apply multiple clips in endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures during a single entry into the body cavity are described in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,084,057 and 5,100,420 to Green et al., which are both incorporated by reference in their entirety. Another multiple endoscopic clip applier is disclosed in commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 5,607,436 to Pratt et al., the contents of which is also hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. These devices are typically, though not necessarily, used during a single surgical procedure. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/515,341 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,502 to Pier et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, discloses a resterilizable surgical clip applier. The clip applier advances and forms multiple clips during a single insertion into the body cavity. This resterilizable clip applier is configured to receive and cooperate with an interchangeable clip magazine so as to advance and form multiple clips during a single entry into a body cavity. One significant design goal is that the surgical clip be loaded between the jaws without any compression of the clip from the loading procedure. Such bending or torque of the clip during loading often has a number of unintended consequences. Such compression during loading may alter slightly the alignment of the clip between the jaws. This will cause the surgeon to remove the clip from between the jaws for discarding the clip. Additionally such preloading compression may slight compress parts of the clip and change a geometry of the clip. This will cause the surgeon to remove the compressed clip from between the jaws for discarding the clip. Endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures are often performed remotely from the incision. Consequently, application of clips may be complicated by a reduced field of view or reduced tactile feedback for the user at the proximal end of the device. It is therefore desirable to improve the operation of the instrument by providing indication to the user of a firing of an individual clip, the depletion of the clips contained in the loading unit, or any other surgical event. It is also desirable to provide a surgical clip applier that promotes a successful loading of the clip and that wedges the jaws of the surgical clip applier open, then loads the clip between the jaws in order to prevent any damage or excessive compression of the clip and prevents compression of the jaws on the clip before firing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Embodiments of surgical clip appliers in accordance with the present disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the drawing figures wherein like reference numerals identify similar or identical structural elements. As shown in the drawings and described throughout the following description, as is traditional when referring to relative positioning on a surgical instrument, the term “proximal” refers to the end of the apparatus which is closer to the user and the term “distal” refers to the end of the apparatus which is further away from the user. Referring now to FIGS. 1-5, a surgical clip applier in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is generally designated as 100. Clip applier 100 includes a handle assembly 102 and an endoscopic portion including a shaft assembly 104 extending distally from handle assembly 102. Shaft assembly 104 has an outer diameter of about 10 mm. Shaft assembly 104 may have various elongated or shortened lengths depending on intended use, such as, for example, in bariatric surgery. As seen in FIGS. 1-5, surgical clip applier 100 includes a pair of jaws 106 mounted on a distal end of shaft assembly 104 and actuatable by a trigger 108 of handle assembly 102. Jaws 106 are formed of a suitable biocompatible material such as, for example, stainless steel or titanium and define a channel 106a therebetween for receipt of a surgical clip “C” therein. When jaws 106 are in an open or un-approximated condition relative to each other, a width of jaws 106 measures greater than an outer diameter of shaft assembly 104. Jaws 106 are mounted in the distal end of shaft assembly 104 such that they are longitudinally stationary relative thereto. A knob 110 may be rotatably mounted on a distal end of handle assembly 102 and affixed to shaft assembly 104 to transmit and/or provide 360° rotation to shaft assembly 104 and jaws 106 about a longitudinal axis thereof (see FIG. 2). Referring now to FIGS. 1-8, handle assembly 102 of surgical clip applier 100 is shown. Handle assembly 102 includes a housing 103 having a first or right side half-section 103a and a second or left side half-section 103b. Handle assembly 102 includes a trigger 108 pivotably supported between right side half-section 103a and left side half-section 103b. Handle assembly 102 defines a window 103c formed in housing 103 for supporting and displaying a counter mechanism, as will be discussed in greater detail below. Housing 103 of handle assembly 102 may be formed of a suitable plastic material. Housing 103 supports a drive assembly 120 between right side half-section 103a and left side half-section 103b. Drive assembly 120 includes a wishbone link 122 having a first end pivotally connected to trigger 108, and a second end pivotally connected to a crank plate 124. As seen in FIGS. 6-9, drive assembly 120 further includes a drive connector 134 rotatably connected to crank plate 124, a plunger 135 interconnected to drive connector 134, and a spring 136 supported on drive connector 134. Plunger 135 defines a longitudinal slot 135a configured and adapted to receive a proximal end of a drive bar 140 therein. Drive bar 140 is connected to plunger 135 via an integral pin 135b (see FIG. 9). A cap 144 is provided through which plunger 135 extends. A seal (not shown) is provided to create an air-tight seal between plunger 135 and an outer tube 150. As seen in FIGS. 6-8, handle assembly 102 further includes a rack 124a formed in/on crank plate 124 such that rack 124a is movable therewith. Rack 124a includes a plurality of teeth interposed between a distal recess 124b and a proximal recess 124c defined in crank plate 124. Recesses 124b and 124c are provided to allow pawl 224 to reverse and advance back over the teeth of rack 124a when crank plate 124 changes between proximal and distal movement. Handle assembly 102 further includes a pawl 224 pivotally connected to housing 103 by a pawl pin 226 at a location wherein pawl 224 is in substantial operative engagement with rack 124a of crank plate 124. Pawl 224 includes a pawl tooth 224a which is selectively engageable with the teeth of rack 124a of crank plate 124. Pawl tooth 224a is engageable with the rack teeth to restrict longitudinal movement of rack 124a and, in turn, crank plate 124 within handle assembly 102. A pawl spring 228 is provided to bias pawl 224 into operative engagement with rack 124a of crank plate 124. As seen in FIGS. 6-8, crank plate 124 is pivotably connected to wishbone link 122 via a pin 123. Crank plate 124 defines a series of ratchet teeth 124a formed therein for selective engagement with pawl 224. As seen in FIGS. 8, 8A and SB, handle assembly 102 further includes an audible/tactile feedback member 126 operatively associated with trigger 108 so as to rotate together with and about a common axis as trigger 108 is actuated. Feedback member 126 defines a race 126a defining a plurality of ratchets or steps 126b. A deflectable arm 127 is provided and includes a first end operative connected or disposed in race 126a, in contact with steps 126b, of feedback member 126 and a second end connected to housing 103. In operation, as trigger 108 is actuated, arm 127 rides through and/or along race 126a formed in feedback member 126. As will be discussed in greater detail below, as arm 127 moves over steps 126b of feedback member 126, arm 127 snaps over steps 126b and creates an audible sound/click and/or a tactile vibration. Audible/tactile feedback member 126 includes sufficient steps 126b so as to create an audible/tactile indication after a clip has been fully loaded into the jaws of surgical clip applier 100, after the loaded clip has been formed by the jaws of surgical clip applier 100, and when surgical clip applier 100 is reset to the home position and ready to fire/form another clip. As seen in FIGS. 6, 7, 8 and 8A, handle assembly 102 of surgical clip applier 100 further includes a counter mechanism 132 supported in housing 103 and visible through window 103c defined in housing 103. Counter mechanism 132 includes a display 132a, a processor 132b, and an energy source (not shown) in the form of a battery or the like. Display 132a may be any device known in the art to provide an indication of an event. The event may be related to the procedure or the operation of the clip applier 100. Display 132a is a liquid crystal display (LCD). Display 132a displays one or more operating parameters of clip applier 100 to the surgeon. The operating parameter displayed by display 132a includes an amount or number of clips remaining, a number of clips that have been used, a position parameter, a surgical time of usage, or any other parameter of the procedure. A Mylar or another polymeric insulating material is disposed between battery or energy source and a contact of processor 132b which prevents the battery or energy source from becoming drained during storage. The tab extends out of housing 103 of surgical clip applier 100 in order to allow for easy removal of the tab therefrom. Once the tab is removed, battery or energy source comes into electrical contact with the contact of processor 132b and in turn energizes display 132a. As seen in FIGS. 6, 7, 8 and 8A, handle assembly 102 of surgical clip applier 100 further includes a counter actuation mechanism including a counter actuation lever 130 having a first arm 130a configured and adapted to operatively, selectively engage processor 132b of counter mechanism 132. Counter actuation lever 130 further includes a second arm 130b configured and adapted to operatively, slidably engage a slot 128a formed in an actuator plate 128 slidably supported in housing 103. In operation, as will be described in greater detail below, as trigger 108 is squeezed, trigger 108 causes wishbone link 122 to be advanced distally, causing crank plate 124 to be advanced distally. When arm 124d of crank plate 124 is advanced a predetermined distance, arm 124d engages or contacts finger 128b of actuator plate 128. As crank plate 124 is further advanced distally, crank plate 124 forces or pulls actuator plate 128 in a distal direction thereby actuating counter actuation lever 130 to activate counter mechanism 132. In particular, when actuator plate 128 is moved distally a sufficient distance, second arm 130b of counter actuation lever 130 is cammed within slot 128b thereof and rotates counter actuation lever 130 resulting in first arm 130a. When actuator plate 128 is moved proximally a sufficient distance, second arm 130b of counter actuation lever 130 is returned to a home position resulting in first arm 130a of counter actuation lever 130 disengaging counter mechanism 132. Turning now to FIGS. 9-31A, shaft assembly 104 of surgical clip applier 100 is shown and described hereinbelow. Shaft assembly 104 and the components thereof may be formed of suitable biocompatible materials, such as, for example, stainless steel, titanium, plastics and the like. Shaft assembly 104 includes an outer tube 150 having a proximal end 150a supported within housing 103, a distal end 150b, and a lumen 150c extending therethrough. Outer tube 150 is secured within housing 103 by a flange projecting from an outer surface thereof. Shaft assembly 104 further includes an upper housing 152a and a lower housing 152b, each disposed within lumen 150c of outer tube 150. A rear upper housing 154 is disposed within outer tube 150 and proximal of upper housing 152a. As seen in FIGS. 9, 12 and 13, shaft assembly 104 further includes a pusher bar 156 slidably disposed within upper housing 152a and a rear upper housing 154. Pusher bar 156 includes a distal end 156a defining a narrow-profile pusher 156c configured and adapted to selectively engage/move (i.e., distally advance) a distal-most clip “C1” of a stack of clips “C” and to remain in contact with the distal-most clip “C1” during an initial formation thereof. Pusher bar 156 further includes a proximal end 156b. Pusher bar 156 defines a distal window 156d having a catch 156e, a pair of recesses 156f located proximal of distal window 156d and formed in each side edge thereof, an elongate slot 156g located proximal of side recesses 156f, and a proximal-most window 156h located proximal of slot 156g. As seen in FIGS. 9 and 14, pusher bar 156 supports a first snap clip 157a along an upper surface thereof at a location distal of side recesses 156f of pusher bar 156. First snap clip 157a is configured in such a manner that the tines thereof project or are spaced an amount from an upper surface of pusher bar 156. As seen in FIGS. 9 and 15, pusher bar 156 supports a second snap clip 157b along a lower surface thereof at a location proximal of a proximal-most window 156h of pusher bar 156. Second snap clip 157b is oriented in such a manner that the tines thereof project an amount sufficient to overlie proximal-most window 156h of pusher bar 156. The tines of second snap clip 157b are spaced from one another by an amount that is less than a width of proximal-most window 156h of pusher bar 156. As seen in FIGS. 9 and 16-20, shaft assembly 104 further includes an advancer plate 162 reciprocally supported beneath pusher bar 156. As seen in FIGS. 16 and 17, a fourth snap clip 157d is supported at a proximal end of advancer plate 162. Snap clip 157d includes a pair of tines that are detachably connected in proximal retaining grooves 152m and distal retaining grooves 152n formed in upper housing 152a. In this manner, in use, snap clip 157d detachably engage retaining grooves 152m and distal retaining grooves 152n to maintain advancer plate 162 in a proximal or a distal position. Upon distal advancement of advancer plate 162, the tines of snap clip 157d cam inward and allow advancer plate 162 to continue to move distally. As seen in FIGS. 18-20, advancer plate 162 includes a series of windows 162a formed therein and extending along a length thereof. As seen in FIG. 19, each window 162a defines a proximal edge that extends below a surface of advancer plate 162 so as to define a lip or ledge 162c. Advancer plate 162 further includes a pair of side fin 162b extending from a side edge thereof, in a direction toward upper housing 152a. As seen in FIG. 15, a pair of side fins 162b are slidably disposed within side recesses 156f of pusher bar 156. As seen in FIGS. 9 and 21-22, shaft assembly 104 further includes a clip carrier 164 disposed within upper housing 152a, and beneath advancer plate 162. Clip carrier 164 is generally a box-like structure having an upper wall, a pair of side walls and a lower wall defining a channel therethrough. Clip carrier 164 includes a plurality of spaced apart windows 164a (see FIG. 9) formed in the lower wall and extending longitudinally along a length thereof. Clip carrier 164 includes an elongate window formed in the upper wall and extending longitudinally along a length thereof. As seen in FIGS. 9 and 21, a stack of surgical clips “C” is loaded and/or retained within the channel of clip carrier 164 in a manner so as to slide therewithin and/or therealong. The channel of clip carrier 164 is configured and dimensioned to slidably retain a stack or plurality of surgical clips “C” in tip-to-tail fashion therewithin. As seen in FIG. 19, a distal end of clip carrier 164 includes a pair of spaced apart, resilient tangs 164b. Tangs 164b are configured and adapted to detachably engage a backspan of a distal-most surgical clip “C1” of the stack of surgical clips “C” retained within clip carrier 164. As seen in FIGS. 9 and 21-24, shaft assembly 104 of clip applier 100 further includes a clip follower 166 slidably disposed within the channel of clip carrier 164. As will be described in greater detail below, clip follower 166 is positioned behind the stack of surgical clips “C” and is provided to urge the stack of clips “C” forward during an actuation of clip applier 100. As will be described in greater detail below, clip follower 166 is actuated by the reciprocating forward and backward motion of advancer plate 162. As seen in FIGS. 23, 23A and 24, clip follower 166 includes body portion 166a, a distal tab 166b extending substantially upwardly and rearwardly from body portion 166a, and a proximal tab 166c extending substantially downwardly and rearwardly from body portion 166a. Distal tab 166b of clip follower 166 is configured and dimensioned to selectively engage ledges 162e of windows 162a of advancer plate 162. In use, engagement of distal tab 166b of clip follower 166 against ledges 162c of windows 162a of advancer plate 162 causes clip follower 166 to incrementally advance or travel distally as advancer plate 162 is advanced or moved in a distal direction. Proximal tab 166c is configured and dimensioned to selectively engage windows 164a formed in clip carrier 164. In use, engagement of proximal tab 166c of clip follower 166 in a window 164a formed clip carrier 164 prevents clip follower 166 from traveling or moving in a proximal direction. Clip follower 166 includes a lock-out plate 165 supported thereon or alternatively, integrally formed therewith. Lock-out plate 165 includes a resilient tail 165a, defining a window 165b, extending therefrom, in a direction upwardly and rearwardly from body portion 166a of clip follower 166. As seen in FIGS. 9, 25 and 38, shaft assembly 104 further includes a drive channel 168 reciprocally supported in channel assembly 104 at a location below clip carrier 164. Drive channel 168 is a substantially U-shaped channel including a pair of spaced apart side walls 168b extending from a backspan 168c thereof, in a direction away from clip carrier 164 and towards lower housing 152b. Drive channel 168 further includes a tab 168d projecting from backspan 168c, at a location proximal of slot 168a, and extending in the direction of side walls 168b. As seen in FIG. 41, drive channel 168 defines a slot or window 168e formed in one of side walls 168b for selectively receiving a tooth 194c of wedge plate release 194. As seen in FIGS. 9 and 25, shaft assembly 104 of clip applier 100 includes a drive channel strap 167 secured to drive channel 168. Strap 167 is secured to side walls 168b of drive channel 168 so as to extend transversely thereacross. Strap 167 is secured to drive channel 168 at a location distal of elongate slot 168a. Strap 167 is secured to drive channel 168 such that wedge plate 172 extends between backspan 168c of drive channel 168 and jaws 106. As seen in FIGS. 9, 26 and 27, clip applier 100 includes a pair of jaws 106 mounted on or at a distal end of shaft assembly 104 and actuatable by trigger 108. Jaws 106 are formed of a suitable biocompatible material such as, for example, stainless steel or titanium. Jaws 106 are mounted adjacent a distal end of drive channel 168, via bosses formed in lower housing 152b that engage receiving slots formed in jaws 106, such that jaws 106 are held stationary relative to drive channel 168. As seen in FIG. 25, jaws 106 define a channel 106a therebetween for receipt of a surgical clip “C” therein. As seen in FIGS. 9, 25 and 26, shaft assembly 104 of clip applier 100 further includes a wedge plate 172 having a distal end interposed between drive channel 168 and jaws 106 and a proximal end extending through shaft assembly 104. Wedge plate 172 includes a substantially tapered distal end 172a for selective operative interposition between jaws 106. As seen in FIG. 26, wedge plate 172 defines a fin or tab 172b projecting from a lower surface thereof. As seen in FIG. 22, wedge plate 172 defines a proximal-most slot 172c formed therein for slidably receiving a second stem 174c of a connector plate 174 therein. As seen in FIG. 22, a third snap clip 157c is supported at a proximal end of wedge plate 172. Third snap clip 157c is oriented in such a manner that the tines thereof project an amount sufficient to overlie proximal-most window 172c formed in wedge plate 172. The tines of third snap clip 157c are spaced from one another by an amount that is less than a width of proximal-most window 172c of wedge plate 172. As seen in FIGS. 9, 18, 20 and 36, shaft assembly 104 of clip applier 100 further includes a connector plate 174 slidably interposed between pusher bar 156 and wedge plate 172 and detachably connectable to each of pusher bar 156 and wedge plate 172. Connector plate 174 includes a tapered distal end 174a, a first stem 174b extending from an upper surface thereof and a second stem 174c extending from a bottom surface thereof. Each stem 174b, 174c has a substantially tear-drop shaped profile wherein a distal end of each stem 174b, 174c is larger than a proximal end thereof. In operation, first stem 174b of connector plate 174 is configured and dimensioned for detachable connection with second snap clip 157b that is secured to pusher bar 156, and second stem 174c of connector plate 174 is configured and dimensioned for detachable connection with third snap clip 157c that is secured to wedge plate 172. As seen in FIGS. 22, 36 and 37, second stem 174c of connector plate 174 extends into a window 140b defined in drive bar 140. In this manner, as drive bar 140 is also reciprocated, connector plate 174 is reciprocated therewith. As seen in FIG. 31A, a guard 198 is supported in lower housing 152b at a location so as to maintain the relative distance between the tines of the third snap-clip 157c during an initial distal advancement thereof. In this manner, second stem 174b of connector plate 174 can not prematurely disengage from third snap clip 157c until third snap clip 157c has surpassed guard 198. As seen in FIGS. 9, 27, 29 and 41, shaft assembly 104 of clip applier 100 further includes a slider joint 180 slidably supported within a channel of lower housing 152b. Slider joint 180 includes a body portion 182 and a rod 184 extending therefrom. When properly positioned within the channel of lower housing 152b, rod 184 of slider joint 180 extends in a substantially distal direction. Rod 184 of slider joint 180 slidably passes through a stub 152d formed in and extending from the channel of lower housing 152b (see FIG. 29). Shaft assembly 104 further includes a biasing member 186, in the form of a compression spring, supported on rod 184 and interposed between stub 152d of lower housing 152b and body portion 182 of slider joint 180. Body portion 182 of slider joint 180 includes a boss 182a formed near a proximal end thereof, and configured and adapted for slidable engagement in elongate slot 140a of drive bar 140 (see FIG. 29). Body portion 182 of slider joint 180 further includes a pocket 182b formed near a distal end thereof, and configured and adapted for receiving tab 168d of drive channel 168 therein (see FIGS. 38 and 39). As seen in FIGS. 9, 27 and 28, shaft assembly 104 of clip applier 100 further includes a wedge plate lock 190 slidably supported in the channel of lower housing 152b and in drive channel 168. Wedge plate lock 190 includes a body portion 190a, a rod 190b extending distally from body portion 190a, a tail 190c extending proximally from body portion 190a, a pocket 190d formed in an upper surface of body portion 190a, and a stem or tooth 190e extending from tail 190c. Shaft assembly 104 further includes a biasing member 192, in the form of a compression spring, supported on rod 190h and interposed between lower housing 152b of and body portion 190a of wedge plate lock 190. Shaft assembly 104 of clip applier 100 further includes a wedge plate release 194 rotatably supported in the channel of lower housing 152b. Wedge plate release 194 includes a stem 194a configured for engagement with tooth 190e extending from tail 190c of wedge lock plate 190, a hammer 194b extending outwardly from stem 194a in a direction toward tail 190c of wedge plate lock 190, and a tooth 194c extending outwardly from stem 194a in a direction away from tail 190c of wedge plate lock 190. The operation of surgical clip applier 100, to form or crimp a surgical clip around a target tissue, such as, for example, a vessel, will now be described. With reference to FIGS. 32-43, surgical clip applier 100 is shown prior to any operation or use thereof. As seen in FIGS. 32 and 33, prior to use or firing of clip applier 100, trigger 108 is generally in an uncompressed or unactuated state. As such, crank plate 124 of drive assembly 120 is at a retracted or proximal-most position and thus, plunger 135 and drive bar 140 are also at a retracted position. When crank plate 124 is in the retracted position, pawl 224 is disposed within distal recess 124b defined in crank plate 124. When drive assembly 120 and drive bar 140 are in the retracted position, as seen in FIGS. 35-37, connector plate 174 is located at a retracted or proximal-most position. With connector plate 174 at a retracted or proximal-most position, pusher bar 156 is also at a retracted or proximal-most position and first tear-drop stem 174b of connector plate 174 is disposed at a proximal end of proximal-most window 156h of pusher bar 156 and retained in snap-fit engagement in the tines of second snap clip 157b. Also, with connector plate 174 at a retracted or proximal-most position, wedge plate 172 is also at a retracted or proximal-most position and second tear-drop stem 174c of connector plate 174 is disposed at a proximal end of proximal-most window 172c of wedge plate 172 and retained in snap-fit engagement in the tines of third snap clip 157c. As seen in FIGS. 36 and 37, when drive assembly 120 and drive bar 140 are in the retracted position, tab 182a of slider joint 182 is located at a distal-most position in elongate slot 140a of drive bar 140. As seen in FIGS. 38 and 39, when drive assembly 120 and drive bar 140 are in the retracted position, clip follower 166 is located at a proximal-most end of the channel of clip carrier 164, wherein distal tab 166b of clip follower 166 is operatively disposed within a proximal-most window 162a of advancer plate 162 and proximal tab 166c is operatively disposed within a proximal-most window 164a of clip carrier 164. With continued reference to FIGS. 38 and 39, when drive assembly 120 and drive bar 140 are in the retracted position, slider joint 180 is located at a proximal-most position and since tab 168d of drive channel 168 is disposed within pocket 182b of slider joint 180, drive channel 168 is also located at a proximal-most position. As seen in FIGS. 38 and 39, slider joint 180 abuts against a physical stop 152e (see FIG. 30) projecting from lower housing 152b. As seen in FIGS. 40 and 41, when drive assembly 120 and drive bar 140 are in the retracted position, wedge plate lock 190 is located at a proximal-most position such that tooth 190e extending from tail 190c thereof is disposed proximal of a ramped ledge 152f formed in lower housing 152b (see FIGS. 30 and 31). As seen in FIG. 41, wedge plate lock 190 abuts against a physical stop 152g projecting from lower housing 152b. Also as seen in FIG. 41, wedge plate release 194 is disposed in a first position such that tooth 194c thereof projects into window 168e formed in side wall 168b of drive channel 168. As seen in FIGS. 42 and 43, when drive assembly 120 and drive bar 140 are in the retracted position, pusher 156c of pusher bar 156 is disposed proximal of a backspan of a distal-most clip “C” retained in clip carrier 164. Distal-most clip “C” is retained within the channel of clip carrier 164 by tangs 164b thereof. Also, in this position, as described above, wedge plate 172 is located at a proximal-most position such that distal end 172a thereof is positioned proximal of jaws 106. As seen in FIG. 43, with drive channel 168 at a proximal-most position, a distal end thereof is disengaged from proximal camming surfaces 106b of jaws 106. Turning now to FIGS. 44-54, as trigger 108 is squeezed or actuated from the initial position, during a first stage of an initial stroke, trigger 108 causes wishbone link 122 to move crank plate 124 in a distal direction which, in turn, causes drive connector 134 and plunger 135 to move distally and to move drive bar 140 distally. As plunger 135 is moved distally, spring 136 is compressed an initial amount. Simultaneously therewith, as crank plate 124 is moved distally the teeth of rack 124a engage tooth 224a of pawl 224 as pawl 224 is moved out or rotated of distal recess 124a of crank plate 124. In this manner, crank plate 124 can not return to a proximal-most position without completing a full distal stroke. As seen in FIG. 44, as trigger 108 is squeezed an initial amount, arm 127 begins to translate through race 126a of feedback member 126. As seen in FIG. 46, as drive bar 140 is moved in a distal direction, drive bar 140 pushes connector plate 174 in a distal direction. Since pusher bar 156 is selectively connected to connector plate 174 via second snap clip 157b, pusher bar 156 is advanced or pulled in a distal direction. Also, since wedge plate 172 is selectively connected to connector plate 174 via third snap clip 157c, wedge plate 172 is also advanced or dragged in a distal direction. As drive bar 140 is moved in the distal direction, elongate slot 140a thereof is also moved in a distal direction such that tab 182a of slider joint 182 is translated in a proximal direction relative thereto. As seen in FIG. 47-49, as wedge plate 172 is moved in a distal direction, since tab 172b of wedge plate 172 is retained in pocket 190d of wedge plate lock 190, wedge plate lock 190 is moved or dragged in a distal direction causing tooth 190e of tail 190c thereof to cam over ramped ledge 152f formed in lower housing 152b, thereby moving from a position proximal of ramped ledge 152f to a position distal of ramped ledge 152f. As wedge plate lock 190 is moved in a distal direction, biasing member 192 is compressed an initial amount. As seen in FIG. 49, wedge plate lock 190 is moved in a distal direction until wedge plate lock 190 abuts against a physical stop formed in lower housing 152b. As seen in FIG. 47A, as pusher bar 156 is moved in a distal direction, fins 162b of advancer plate 162 translate, a predetermined distance, within side recesses 156f of pusher bar 156 until fins 162b contact or engage a proximal end of side recesses 156f of pusher bar 156. As seen in FIGS. 47B and 47C, as wedge plate 172 is moved in the distal direction, due to the connection of second stem 174c of connector plate 174 with third snap clip 157c, second stem 174c of connector plate 174 is prevented from prematurely disconnecting from third snap clip 157c by guard 198. In particular, guard 198 acts on the tips of the tines of third snap clip 157c to prevent the tines from splaying outward due to the forces acting thereon by the distal forces generated by second stem 174c as connector plate 174 is moved in the distal direction. As seen in FIG. 50, as pusher bar 156 is moved in a distal direction pusher 156c thereof engages a backspan of a distal-most clip “C” and begins to urge distal-most clip “C” in a distal direction. As pusher bar 156 moves distal-most clip “C” in a distal direction, distal-most clip “C” snaps out from behind tangs 164b of clip carrier 164 and begins to enter into channels 106a of jaws 106. As seen in FIG. 51, as wedge plate 172 is moved in a distal direction, distal end 172a thereof enters between jaws 106 causing jaws 106 to splay outwardly. Wedge plate 172 is prevented from further movement in the distal direction, as seen in FIGS. 52-54, once wedge plate lock 190 abuts against the physical stop formed in lower housing 152b. However, drive bar 140 continues to move connector plate 174 in a distal direction. Since connector plate 174 is continued to be forced distally, once the tips of the tines of third snap clip 157c move distally beyond guard 198, the forces acting on second stem 174c are sufficient to cause the tines of third snap clip 157c to splay outward and allow second stem 174c to snap out from therebetween thereby allowing for connector plate 174 to continue to move in a distal direction. Turning now to FIGS. 55-69, as trigger 108 is further squeezed or actuated from the first stage of the initial stroke through a second stage of the initial stroke, trigger 108 causes wishbone link 122 to further move crank plate 124 in a distal direction which, in turn, causes drive connector 134 and subsequently plunger 135 to further move distally and to further move drive bar 140 distally. As plunger 135 is moved distally, spring 136 is compressed a further amount. Simultaneously therewith, as crank plate 124 is moved distally the teeth of rack 124a thereof move further proximally with respect to tooth 224a of pawl 224. As such, crank plate 124 still can not return to a proximal-most position without completing a full distal stroke. As seen in FIG. 55, as crank plate 124 is moved distally, after a predetermine distance, arm 124d thereof engages or contacts finger 128b of actuator plate 128. As crank plate 124 is further advanced distally, crank plate 124 forces or pulls actuator plate 128 in a distal direction thereby actuating counter actuation lever 130 to activate counter mechanism 132. In particular, when actuator plate 128 is moved distally a sufficient distance, second arm 130b of counter actuation lever 130 is cammed within slot 128b thereof and is urged to rotate resulting in first arm 130a of counter actuation lever 130 engaging counter mechanism 132 and thereby effectuating a change in the display thereof. In particular, the display, which displays the number of clips remaining in surgical clip applier 100, will reduce by one. Alternatively, the clip counter mechanism will increment by one or produce some other change. As trigger 108 is squeezed further, arm 127 continues to translate through race 126a of feedback member 126. At this point in the squeezing of trigger 108, a surgical clip is loaded into the jaws 106. Accordingly, arm 127 will interact with a step 126b formed in race 126a of feedback member 126 and create an audible/tactile indication advising the user that a clip has been loaded into the jaws. As seen in FIG. 57, as drive bar 140 is moved further in a distal direction, drive bar 140 continues to push connector plate 174 in a distal direction. Since pusher bar 156 is still selectively connected to connector plate 174 via second snap clip 157b, pusher bar 156 is further advanced or dragged in the distal direction. However, since third snap clip 157c of wedge plate 172 is disconnected from second stem 174c of connector plate 174, wedge plate 172 is not further advanced or dragged in the distal direction. As seen in FIGS. 56A to 56C, as pusher bar 156 is continued to be moved in a distal direction, with the pair of fins 162b of advancer plate 162 engaged by the proximal end of side recesses 156f of pusher bar 156, pusher bar 156 advances or drags advancer plate 162 in a distal direction. As seen in FIGS. 56B and 56C, as advancer plate 162 is advanced distally, snap clip 157d disengages proximal retaining grooves 152m and engages distal retaining grooves 152n formed in upper housing 152a. As seen in FIG. 57, drive bar 140 is moved in the distal direction until tab 182a of slider joint 182 is relatively translated to a proximal-most position in elongate slot 140a of drive bar 140. As pusher bar 156 continues to move in a distal direction, pusher bar 156 continues to urge advancer plate 162 in a distal direction via fins 162b. As seen in FIG. 58, as advancer plate 162 is moved in a distal direction, distal tab 166b of clip follower 166 is engaged by a proximal edge of a window 162a receiving distal tab 166b of clip follower 166 in order to urge clip follower 166 in a distal direction, relative to clip carrier 164, and thereby advance the stack of clips “C” by an incremental amount. As clip follower 166 is moved in a distal direction, proximal tab 166c thereof is caused to be advanced distally, one window 164a, from a relatively proximal window 164a of clip carrier 164 to a relatively distal window 164a of clip carrier 164. As seen in FIGS. 58-60, as pusher bar 156 is moved in a distal direction, first snap clip 157a, supported on pusher bar 156, snaps onto boss 152h of upper housing 152a, thus maintaining pusher bar 156 in a forward position. Additionally, as seen in FIG. 61, as pusher bar 156 continues to move in a distal direction, the stack of clips “C” is caused to move in a distal direction. As seen in FIG. 62, as pusher bar 156 is moved in a distal direction pusher 156c thereof continues to move a distal-most clip “C1” in a distal direction until distal-most clip “C1” completely enters into channels 106a of jaws 106. In operation, pusher 156c of pusher bar 156 remains in contact with the backspan of the loaded clip “C” during the formation of said clip “C” in order to provide stability thereto and to maintain the proper position thereof. As seen in FIG. 63, as drive bar 140 is moved further in the distal direction, shoulders 140c thereof contact a proximal-most end of drive channel 168. In this manner, as drive bar 140 is moved further in the distal direction, drive bar 140 moves or urges drive channel 168 in the distal direction. As seen in FIG. 64, as drive channel 168 is moved in a distal direction, a proximal edge of window 168e formed in side wall 168b of drive channel 168 contacts against tooth 194c of wedge plate release 194 causing wedge plate release 194 to rotate. As wedge plate release 194 rotates, hammer 194b thereof, presses against tooth 190e of wedge plate lock 190 to urge or kick tooth 190e out from behind ramped ledge 152f. In so doing, as seen in FIG. 65, biasing member 192 is permitted to decompress thus moving wedge plate lock 190 in a proximal direction. As seen in FIG. 66, as wedge plate lock 190 is moved in a proximal direction, and since wedge plate 172 is connected thereto, wedge plate 172 is moved in a proximal direction to withdraw distal end 172a thereof out of engagement from jaws 106. As seen in FIGS. 58 and 67-69, since pusher bar 156 is maintained in the distal position by the connection of first snap clip 157a with boss 152h, as drive bar 140 is moved further in a distal direction, the forces acting on connector plate 174 cause second snap clip 157b to disengage from first stem 174b of connector plate 174 thereby allowing for connector plate 174 to continue to move in a distal direction. As seen in FIGS. 67A-69A, in an embodiment, the tips of the tines of second snap clip 157b may be configured to project outwardly so as to engage a surface of rear upper housing 154 (see FIG. 9), thereby preventing premature disengagement of second snap clip 157b from first stem 174b of connector plate 174. In this embodiment, recesses may be formed in the surfaces of rear upper housing 154 coinciding with locations at which the tines of second snap clip 157b may splay outward thus allowing first stem 174b of connector plate 174 to disengage an to continue to move in a distal direction. As seen in FIGS. 70-75, as trigger 108 is actuated through a final stage of the initial stroke, trigger 108 causes wishbone link 122 to further move crank plate 124 in a distal direction which, in turn, causes drive connector 134 and plunger 135 to further move distally and to further move drive bar 140 distally. As drive connector 134 is moved distally, spring 136 is compressed a further amount. Simultaneously therewith, as crank plate 124 is moved distally the teeth of rack 124a thereof move further proximally with respect to tooth 224a of pawl 224 to a position where the teeth of rack 124a disengage from tooth 224a of pawl 224 as tooth 224a of pawl 224 enters proximal recess 124c of crank plate 124 and thus resets itself. As such, crank plate 124 may return to a proximal-most position upon a release of trigger 108. As seen in FIGS. 72-74, during the final stage of the initial stroke of trigger 108, drive channel 168 and strap 167 are moved in a distal direction relative to jaws 106 such that a distal edge of drive channel 168 engages against camming surfaces 106b of jaws 106 causing jaws 106 to close and form the clip “C1” positioned therebetween. As seen in FIG. 74, pusher 156c of pusher bar 156 remains at a distal position, in contact with a backspan of said clip “C” during the formation thereof. As seen in FIG. 55, as trigger 108 is squeezed a final amount, arm 127 continues to translate through race 126a of feedback member 126. At this point in the squeezing of trigger 108, surgical clip “C1” has been fully formed by jaws 106. Accordingly, arm 127 will interact with another step 126b formed in race 126a of feedback member 126 and create an audible/tactile indication advising the user that surgical clip “C1” has been formed by jaws 106. As seen in FIG. 75, surgical clip “C1” may be formed or crimped onto a vessel “V” or any other biological tissue. Turning now to FIGS. 76-84, the operation of clip applier 100 as trigger 108 is returned to an un-squeezed or unactuated position, is shown. As seen in FIG. 76, as the trigger is returned to the un-squeezed position, the spring is permitted to uncompress, thus urging crank plate 124 to move in a proximal direction which, in turn, causes the plunger to move proximally and to move the drive bar proximally. Since pawl 224 has been reset, crank plate 124 is now permitted to move proximally until tooth 224a of pawl 224 re-enters the distal recess of crank plate 124. As seen in FIG. 76A, as crank plate 124 is moved proximally, arm 124d thereof disengages finger 128b of actuator plate 128 allowing actuator plate 128 to move in a proximal direction. As actuator plate 128 is moved proximally, second arm 130b of counter actuation lever 130 is cammed within slot 128b thereof and is urged to rotate resulting in first arm 130a of counter actuation lever 130 disengaging from counter mechanism 132. As seen in FIG. 77, as drive bar 140 is moved in a proximal direction, drive bar 140 pulls on connector plate 174, via first stem 174b. As connector plate 174 is moved in a proximal direction, first stem 174b engages the tines of second snap clip 157b and urges pusher bar 156 in a proximal direction via second snap clip 157b. As seen in FIG. 78, as forces act on pusher bar 156 to move pusher bar 156 in a proximal direction, said forces overcome the retention force of first snap clip 157a with boss 152h of upper housing 152a, thus releasing first snap clip 157a from boss 152h and allowing pusher bar 156 to move in the proximal direction. As seen in FIG. 79, as pusher bar 156 continues to move in the proximal direction, a distal end of side recesses 156f thereof engage fins 162b of advancer plate 162 and cause advancer plate 162 to move in a proximal direction. As pusher bar 156 moves in the proximal direction, pusher bar nose 156c snaps behind a distal-most clip of the remaining stack of clips “C” and thus becomes the new distal-most clip “C1.” As seen in FIG. 80, as advancer plate 162 is moved in a proximal direction, proximal tab 166c of clip follower 166 engages a proximal edge of a window 164a of clip carrier 164 in order to maintain the relative position of clip follower 166 in clip carrier 164. As advancer plate 162 is moved in a proximal direction, distal tab 166b thereof is caused to be advanced distally, one window 162a, from a relatively proximal window 162a of advancer plate 162 to a relatively distal window 162a of advancer plate 162. As seen in FIG. 81, when pusher bar 156 stops its proximal movement, upon engagement thereof with a boss protruding from an inner surface of upper housing half 152a, continued proximal movement of connector plate 174 will cause first stem 174b to re-engage with second snap clip 157b. With proximal movement of pusher bar 156 stopped, continued proximal movement of connector plate 174 will cause first stem 174b to re-engage with second snap clip 157b. As seen in FIGS. 82 and 83, as connector plate 174 is moved in a proximal direction, as a result of the proximal movement of drive bar 140, second stem 174c engages the tines of third snap clip 157c and urges wedge plate 172 in a proximal direction via third snap clip 157c. As wedge plate 172 is moved in a proximal direction, wedge plate lock 190 is moved in a proximal direction until wedge plate lock 190 contacts a physical stop in lower housing half 152b, thereby stopping proximal movement of wedge plate 172. Once the tips of the tines of third snap clip 157c move proximally past guard 198, when wedge plate 172 stops its proximal movement, continued proximal movement of connector plate 174 will cause second first stem 174c to re-engage with third snap clip 157c. When trigger 108 is returned to the unactuated position, arm 127 will translate through race 126a of feedback member 126 and interact with another step 126b formed in race 126a of feedback member 126 and create an audible/tactile indication advising the user that surgical clip applier 100 has been reset and is ready to fire again. Turning now to FIGS. 84-85, the configuration of surgical clip applier 100, following application of the last surgical clip “C”, is shown. As seen in FIGS. 84 and 85, when the last surgical clip has been advanced and formed, with pusher bar 156 still in an advanced or distal position, clip follower 166 has been incrementally advanced, by indexer plate 158, an amount sufficient that lock-out plate 165 thereof biases upwardly through a window 162a of advancer plate 162 and into distal window 156d of pusher bar 156. Positioning of lock-out plate 165 in distal window 156d of pusher bar 156 allows for the catch 156e thereof to enter and engage in window 165b of lock-out plate 165. In this manner, since clip follower 166 is maintained in the distal position by proximal tab 166c thereof engaging in distal window 164a of clip carrier 164, lock-out plate 165 engages catch 156e of pusher bar 156 and prevents pusher bar 156 from returning to a proximal-most position to reset pawl 224. Since pusher bar 156 can not or is prevented from moving to its fully proximal position, as seen in FIG. 86, pawl 224 remains engaged with rack 124a of crank plate 124 and is not permitted to enter proximal recess 124c and thus reset itself. Since pawl 224 can not reset itself, crank plate 124 is locked or stopped from distal or proximal movement.
