TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to a method for preparing an optically active amino acid using cosubstrate shuttling of transaminase, more particularly to a method for preparing an optically active amino acid with high conversion rate and high purity by coupling transamination by ω-transaminase with high equilibrium constant and a reaction by α-transaminase with low equilibrium constant using an amino acid cosubstrate and its keto acid that shuttle between the two reactions. BACKGROUND ART Optically active amino acids are important compounds used, for example, as intermediates of various pharmaceuticals. Especially, since unnatural amino acids which are highly valued as optically active intermediates are not metabolites producible by microorganisms, they cannot be produced by the production method of natural amino acids, such as fermentation. Although methods using metal catalysts are developed, they are uneconomical because transition metals are very expensive. Accordingly, an enzyme-based method may be economical and effective for production of optically active amino acids. In this regard, α-transaminase is an industrially useful enzyme for production of optically active amino acids owing to fairly broad substrate specificity and high optical selectivity. However, its industrial utilization is limited because of low conversion rate due to small equilibrium constant. Accordingly, for production of optically active amino acids using the enzyme-based method in industrial scale, it is necessary to overcome the low equilibrium constant of α-transaminase. As existing methods for producing optically active amino acids using enzymes, Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2011-0047789 discloses a method for preparing an amino acid using microorganism-derived chain type transaminase and Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2008-0016287 discloses a method for producing an amino acid using β-transaminase. DISCLOSURE Technical Problem The present disclosure is directed to, in order to overcome the low equilibrium constant of α-transaminase, providing a method for preparing an optically active amino acid with high purity by coupling with a ω-transaminase reaction with very large equilibrium constant using an amino acid cosubstrate exhibiting reactivity for the coupled reactions and a keto acid thereof. Technical Solution In one general aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for preparing an optically active amino acid by a cascade reaction, including coupling a reaction of converting a keto acid to an amino acid by α-transaminase and a reaction of transferring an amino group of an amine substrate by ω-transaminase (TA) using an amino acid cosubstrate.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT INVENTION Hereinafter, the present disclosure is described in more detail. Transaminase is a very important enzyme in amino acid metabolism. It catalyzes the transfer of an amino group between an amino acid and a keto acid with pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme. Unlike other transaminases, ω-transaminase transfers an amino group of an amino acid or an amine compound having no carboxyl group, having the amino group at α-position, to an amino acceptor such as a keto acid or a ketone. Accordingly, ω-transaminase is a very useful enzyme in the production of optically active amine compounds. The present disclosure relates to a method for preparing various optically active amino acids with high efficiency by coupling a reaction by α-transaminase such as branched-chain transaminase, D-amino-acid transaminase, aromatic-amino-acid transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, etc. with a reaction by ω-transaminase using an amino acid cosubstrate and its keto acid that shuttle between the two reactions. In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, to provide a method for preparing various optically active amino acids with high purity and high efficiency by solving the low equilibrium constant problem of the conversion of a keto acid to an amino acid by α-transaminase, a reaction of converting a keto acid to an L-amino acid by branched-chain transaminase is coupled with a reaction of transferring an amino group of an amine substrate by (S)-selective ω-transaminase (ωTA) using an amino acid cosubstrate, as described in [Scheme 1]. In another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a reaction of converting a keto acid to a D-amino acid by D-amino-acid transaminase (DATA) is coupled with a reaction of transferring an amino group of an amine substrate by (R)-selective ω-transaminase (ωTA) using an amino acid cosubstrate, as described in [Scheme 2]. The amino acid cosubstrate that shuttles between the two reactions may be any amino acid which shows reactivity for both reactions and can be converted to its keto acid. Specifically, alanine, homoalanine, leucine, valine, norleucine, etc. may be used. More specifically, alanine or homoalanine having 1 or 2 carbon atoms may be used. The keto acid may be any keto acid for which α-transaminase shows reactivity. Specific examples include pyruvate, 2-oxobutyrate, 2-(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)-2-oxoethanoic acid, trimethylpyruvate, 3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate, 3-methyl-2oxopentanoic acid, 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, 2-oxopentanoic acid, 2-oxohexanoic acid, 2-oxooctanoic acid, fluoropyruvate, hydroxypyruvate, mercaptopyruvate, oxaloacetate, ketoglutarate, phenylglyoxylate, phenylpyruvate, 4-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate, 4-dimethyl-2oxopentanoic acid, 3-dimethyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, 3-ethyl-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, 5-dimethyl-2-oxohexanoic acid, etc. The amine substrate may be any amine for which ω-transaminase shows reactivity. Specific examples include benzylamine, methylbenzylamine, ethylbenzylamine, isopropylamine, 2-butylamine, 1-aminoindane, cyclopropylethylamine, 2-aminopentane, 3-methyl-2-butylamine, 1,3-dimethylbutylamine, 2-aminooctane, 1-methoxy-2-propylamine, 2-aminohexane, p-fluoromethylbenzylamine, mexiletine, 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine, etc. More specifically, benzylamine, methylbenzylamine or isopropylamine may be used. The optically active amino acid produced by the method of the present disclosure may be an optically pure amino acid in L- or D-form, specifically, alanine, homoalanine, norvaline, norleucine, 2-aminocaprylic acid, valine, leucine, isoleucine, tert-leucine, fluoroalanine, serine, cysteine, aspartate, glutamate, phenylglycine, phenylalanine, homophenylalanine, 4-hydroxyphenylalanine, 3-hydroxyadamantylglycine, neopentylglycine, 3-dimethyl-2-aminopentanoic acid, 3-ethyl-3-methyl-2-aminopentanoic acid or 5-dimethyl-2-aminohexanoic acid. In the cascade reaction according to the present disclosure, the concentration of the amino acid cosubstrate may be 0.1-20% of the concentration of the keto acid substrate. If the concentration of the cosubstrate is below 0.1% of the concentration of the keto acid substrate, conversion rate may be low. And, if the concentration of the cosubstrate is above 10% of the concentration of the keto acid substrate, it may be difficult to separate the produced amino acid. Hence, a concentration range of 0.1-10% is preferred. And, the cascade reaction may be conducted by further adding an organic solvent, specifically hexane, to overcome inhibition of the reactivity of the ω-transaminase by the produced ketone or aldehyde.

The bacterium was cultured in 300 mL of an LB broth containing kanamycin and IPTG (final concentration=1 mM) was added to OD 0.5. After further culturing for at least 6 hours at 37° C., the bacterial cells were centrifuged at 10000×g for 20 minutes at 4° C. and resuspended in 15 mL of a resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM calcium chloride, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 20 μM PLP, pH 7). After sonication on ice, followed by centrifugation at 17000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C., the supernatant was obtained as a crude extract.

Accordingly, L-homoalanine, the only substrate showing good activity for the two enzymes, was selected as a cosubstrate that will shuttle between the reactions by the two transaminases. This is graphically illustrated in FIG. 1. Example 12 Determination of Optimal Concentration of Cosubstrate for Coupled Enzyme Reactions by Branched-Chain Transaminase and ω-transaminase and Production of L-tert-leucine by Coupled Enzyme Reactions The change in the production amount of L-tert-leucine was monitored while increasing the concentration of L-homoalanine, which was determined as the cosubstrate of branched-chain transaminase and ω-transaminase in Example 11, with the concentrations of trimethylpyruvate (substrate of branched-chain transaminase) and benzylamine (substrate of ω-transaminase) fixed. The rate of conversion from trimethylpyruvate to L-tert-leucine was measured while conducting reactions at 37° C. for 7 hours using 100 μL of a mixture of 5 mM trimethylpyruvate, 5 mM benzylamine, 5 mM pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), 50 mM potassium phosphate, 0.1 U/mL branched-chain transaminase and 0.1 U/mL ω-transaminase and changing the concentration of the cosubstrate L-homoalanine from 0 mM to 5 mM. Since the conversion rate did not increase significantly above the cosubstrate concentration of 0.5 mM, which is 10% of the substrate concentration, the optimal concentration of the cosubstrate was determined as 10% of that of the keto acid substrate. The result is shown in FIG. 2. Example 13 Production of L-tert-leucine by Coupled Enzyme Reactions while Varying ω-transaminase Concentration with Branched-Chain Transaminase Concentration Fixed The change in conversion rate was monitored while conducting coupled enzyme reactions by varying ω-transaminase concentration with branched-chain transaminase concentration fixed. The rate of conversion to L-tert-leucine with time was monitored while conducting reactions using 20 mM trimethylpyruvate, 2 mM L-homoalanine, 30 mM benzylamine, 0.1 mM PLP, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) and 0.6 U/mL branched-chain transaminase and varying the concentration of ω-transaminase at 5, 50 and 500 mU/mL. Up to 5% conversion rate, i.e. when 1 mM cosubstrate was consumed, there was no difference in the conversion rate depending on the ω-transaminase concentration. However, a very significant difference in the conversion rate was observed at higher conversion rate depending on the ω-transaminase concentration. This suggests that the shuttling effect of the cosubstrate by ω-transaminase is very effective in overcoming the low equilibrium constant of the branched-chain transaminase reaction. The result is shown in FIG. 3. Example 14 Production of L-tert-leucine by Coupled Enzyme Reactions while Varying Branched-Chain Transaminase with ω-transaminase Concentration Fixed The change in conversion rate was monitored while conducting coupled enzyme reactions by varying branched-chain transaminase concentration with ω-transaminase concentration fixed. The rate of conversion to L-tert-leucine with time was monitored while conducting reactions using 20 mM trimethylpyruvate, 2 mM L-homoalanine, 30 mM benzylamine, 0.1 mM PLP, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) and 0.5 U/mL ω-transaminase and varying the concentration of branched-chain transaminase at 6, 60 and 600 mU/mL. Since the cosubstrate was shuttled by the ω-transaminase, a large difference in the conversion rate was observed depending on the branched-chain transaminase concentration from the early stage of reaction. The result is shown in FIG. 4. Example 15 Production of L-tert-leucine by Coupled Enzyme Reactions while Adding Organic Solvent and Using Racemic Cosubstrate to Overcome Inhibition of ω-transaminase Reaction The change in conversion rate was monitored while conducting coupled enzyme reactions by adding hexane and using racemic cosubstrate in order to overcome inhibition of ω-transaminase reaction by the product. L-tert-Leucine was in a biphase system using 1 mL of a mixture of 20 mM trimethylpyruvate, 2 mM L-homoalanine, 30 mM benzylamine, 0.1 mM PLP, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), 1.4 U/mL branched-chain transaminase and 1.9 U/mL ω-transaminase and adding 3 mL of hexane. The change in conversion rate was monitored while changing the concentration of the racemic cosubstrate from 2 mM to 4 mM. The addition of hexane resulted in increased conversion rate because of the production of aldehyde which inhibits the reaction was suppressed. Also, the conversion to L-tert-leucine by the coupled enzyme reactions was not affected at all although the racemic cosubstrate was used. The result is shown in FIG. 5. Example 16 Production of L-tert-leucine Depending on Ratio of ω-transaminase and Branched-Chain Transaminase within Limited Volume The change in conversion rate of L-tert-leucine depending on the ratio of branched-chain transaminase and ω-transaminase within limited volume was monitored. The change in conversion rate to L-tert-leucine was monitored while conducting reactions at 37° C. for 19 hours using 1 mL of a mixture of 20 mM trimethylpyruvate, 4 mM D/L-homoalanine, 30 mM benzylamine, 0.1 mM PLP and 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) while varying the ratio of branched-chain transaminase and ω-transaminase. The best conversion rate was achieved when the ratio of the branched-chain transaminase to the ω-transaminase was 1:8 (U/mL). The result is shown in FIG. 6. Example 17 Production of L-tert-leucine by Coupled Enzyme Reactions with Addition of Organic Solvent Using the enzyme ratio that showed the best conversion rate in Example 16, L-tert-leucine was produced by coupled biphase reactions by adding an organic solvent. The conversion rate was compared while conducting reactions using 1 mL of a mixture of 20 mM trimethylpyruvate, 4 mM D/L-homoalanine, 30 mM benzylamine, 0.1 mM PLP, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), 0.6 U/mL branched-chain transaminase and 4.8 U/mL ω-transaminase 1 mL, with or without (monophase) 3 mL of hexane added. The addition of the organic solvent resulted in the increased conversion to L-tert-leucine close to 200%. When the concentrations of the cosubstrate and its keto acid (2-oxobutyrate) in the reaction mixture were monitored, it was found out that the cosubstrate concentration was continuously maintained close to the initial substrate concentration owing to the addition of the organic solvent, and this resulted in the improved conversion rate to L-tert-leucine. The result is shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8. Example 18 Production of L-tert-leucine by Coupled Enzyme Reactions by ω-transaminase Depending on Amine Substrate The change in conversion rate to L-tert-leucine was monitored while conducting coupled enzyme reactions using benzylamine or (S)-α-methyl benzylamine as an amine substrate of ω-transaminase. The change in conversion rate was monitored while conducting reactions at 37° C. using 1 mL of a mixture of 20 mM trimethylpyruvate, 4 mM D/L-homoalanine, 30 mM amine substrate, 0.1 mM PLP, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), 0.6 U/mL branched-chain transaminase and 0.5 U/mL ω-transaminase. When (S)-α-methylbenzylamine was used as the amine substrate of ω-transaminase, the conversion rate was improved by 150% as compared to when benzylamine was used as the amine substrate. The result is shown in FIG. 9. Example 19 Production of L-tert-leucine by Coupled Enzyme Using Racemic Amine Substrate L-tert-Leucine was produced by coupled enzyme using a racemic amine substrate. L-tert-Leucine was produced at 37° C. by conducting reactions using 1 mL of a mixture of 20 mM trimethylpyruvate, 4 mM D/L-homoalanine, 60 mM rac-α-methylbenzylamine, 0.1 mM PLP, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), 0.6 U/mL branched-chain transaminase and 4.8 U/mL ω-transaminase while adding 6 mL of hexane. Optically active L-tert-leucine was produced by the coupled enzyme reactions with a conversion rate of 95.4%. The conversion from trimethylpyruvate to L-tert-leucine owing to shuttling of the cosubstrate was confirmed from the analysis of the cosubstrate and its keto acid during the coupled enzyme reactions. Also, production of (R)-α-methylbenzylamine by a selective reaction by ω-transaminase was confirmed. The result is shown in FIG. 10, FIG. 11 and FIG. 12. Example 20 Production of L-3-hydroxyadamantylglycine by Coupled Enzyme Reactions L-3-Hydroxyadamantylglycine was produced by coupled enzyme reactions using a racemic amine substrate. L-3-Hydroxyadamantylglycine was produced at 37° C. by conducting reactions using 1 mL of a mixture of 20 mM 2-(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)-2-oxoethanoic acid, 4 mM D/L-homoalanine, 60 mM rac-α-methylbenzylamine, 0.1 mM PLP, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), 0.6 U/mL branched-chain transaminase and 4.8 U/mL ω-transaminase while adding 6 mL of hexane. Optically active L-3-hydroxyadamantylglycine was produced by the coupled enzyme reactions with a conversion rate of 98.15%. The conversion from 2-(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)-2-oxoethanoic acid to L-3-hydroxyadamantylglycine owing to shuttling of the cosubstrate was confirmed from the analysis of the cosubstrate and its keto acid during the coupled enzyme reactions. Also, production of (R)-α-methylbenzylamine by a selective reaction by ω-transaminase was confirmed. The result is shown in FIG. 13, FIG. 14 and FIG. 15.
