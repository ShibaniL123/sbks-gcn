RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a Continuation of Ser. No. 12/853,782, filed on Aug. 10, 2010, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/232,772, filed on Aug. 10, 2009, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) plays a significant role in influencing a large number of central and peripheral processes. 5-HT-selective pharmacotherapies have been developed to treat a wide variety of medical problems including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, migraine, emesis, and appetite control (Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 32, 2002, Academic Press, Fitzgerald, L., Ennis, M. “5-HT2C Receptor Modulators: Progress in Development of New CNS Medicines” pp 21-30). 5-HT exerts its influence through activation of fourteen distinct receptor subtypes in seven separate families (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, 5-HT7). Each of the seven families may also encompass various subtypes. For example, the 5-HT1 family includes subtypes 5-HTIA, 5-HTIB, 5-HTID, 5-HTIE and 5-HT1F. The 5-HT2 family includes 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C. Lastly, the 5-HT3 family includes 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B while the 5-HT5 family includes 5-HT5A. While the 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 families have been studied most extensively, each family has been linked to various disease indications as discussed below. Modulation of the 5-HT family of receptors has been shown to play a role in numerous human diseases including obesity, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), sexual dysfunction, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders (Roth, B., Shapiro, D. “Insights into the Structure and Function of 5-HT2 Family Serotonin Receptors Reveal Novel Strategies for Therapeutic Target Development” Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 2001, 5, 685; Martin, J., Bos, M., Jenck, F., Moreau, J-1., Mutel, V., Sleight, A., Wichmann, J., Andrews, J., Berendsen, H., Broekkamp, C., Ruight, G., Kohler, C., van Delft, A. “5-HT2C Receptor Agonists: Pharmacological Characteristics and Therapeutic Potential” J.

A clinical study in 1997 (Sargent, P., Sharpley, A., Williams, C., Cowen, P. “5-HT2C-Receptor Activation Decreases Appetite and Body Weight in Obese Subjects” Psychopharmacology 1997, 133, 309; Barnes, Nicholas M., Sharp, Trevor “A Review of Central 5-HT Receptors and Their Function” Neuropharmacology 1999, 38, 1038).

Compounds of the Invention The compounds described herein (e.g., a compound of formula I, II, IV, VII, VIII, IX, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, or XVI) can be used for a variety of therapeutic purposes, including the modulation of a 5-HT receptor and can be used, for example to inhibit or activate a 5-HT receptor in a subject. For example 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and/or 5-HT6. Exemplary compounds include compounds of formulae I, II, IV, VII, VIII, IX, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI as shown below. The substituents as provided in compounds I, II, IV, VII, VIII, IX, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, and XVI are as defined above. Exemplary compounds also include the tables and Examples disclosed herein. The compounds of the invention can be prepared by a variety of methods, including those known in the art or apparent to the skilled artisan in light of the present specification. For example, N-unsubstituted indoles can be N-alkylated, for example, with an alkyl halide, using a base such as sodium hydride, to give N-alkylated indoles. 4-substituted indoles can be hydrogenated using, for example, palladium hydroxide on carbon as catalyst in the presence of hydrogen gas, to give 4-hydroxyindoles. 4-hydroxyindoles can be O-alkylated, for example, with an alkyl halide, using a base such as sodium hydride, to give 4-O-alkoxy-N-substituted indoles. N-unsubstituted indoles can be prepared starting from 3-fluoro-2-benzyloxy benzaldehyde via cyclization of a intermediate styrylazide to the ester, followed by hydrolysis, with for example, sodium hydroxide, decarboxylation using as example a copper catalyst and 2-phenylpyridine, oxamidation with oxalyl chloride followed by a secondary amine, and then reduction. The present invention includes compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. Such compounds are useful, for example, as analytical tools or probes in biological assays. In the compounds of the present invention, any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom unless otherwise stated (e.g., hydrogen, H2 or deuterium and H3 or tritium). The formulas described herein may or may not indicate whether atoms at certain positions are isotopically enriched. When a structural formula is silent with respect to whether a particular position is isotopically enriched, it is to be understood that the isotopes at that particular position are present in natural abundance or, that the particular position is isotopically enriched with one or more naturally occurring stable isotopes. For example, the formula —CH2— represents the following possible structures: —CH2—, —CHD- or —CD2-. The variable “D” is defined as deuterium. The terms “compound” or “compounds,” when referring to a compound of this invention or a compound described herein, refers to a collection of molecules having an identical chemical structure, except that there may be isotopic variation among the constituent atoms of the molecules. Thus, it will be clear to those of skill in the art that a compound represented by a particular chemical structure containing indicated hydrogen atoms will contain lesser amounts of isotopologues having deuterium atoms at one or more of the designated hydrogen positions in that structure. Alternatively, a compound represented by a particular chemical structure containing indicated deuterium atoms will contain lesser amounts of isotopologues having hydrogen atoms at one or more of the designated deuterium positions in that structure. The relative amount of such isotopologues in a compound of this invention will depend on a number of factors including isotopic purity of deuterated reagents used to make the compound and the efficiency of incorporation of deuterium in the various synthetic steps used to prepare the compound. The relative amount of such isotopologues in total will be less than 55% of the compound. In other embodiments, the relative amount of such isotopologues in total will be less than 50%, less than 45%, less than 40%, less than 35%, less than 35%, less than 15%, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 1% or less than 0.5% of the compound. The term “isotopologue” refers to a species that differs from a specific compound of this invention only in the isotopic composition thereof. Isotopologues can differ in the level of isotopic enrichment at one or more positions and/or in the position(s) of isotopic enrichment. The compounds of this invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, individual diastereomers and diastereomeric mixtures. Described herein are enantiomerically enriched compounds (e.g., a compound resolved to an enantiomeric excess of 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or greater). All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. The compounds of this invention may also contain linkages (e.g., carbon-carbon bonds) or substituents that can restrict bond rotation, e.g. restriction resulting from the presence of a ring or double bond. Accordingly, all cis/trans and E/Z isomers are expressly included in the present invention. The compounds of this invention may also be represented in multiple tautomeric forms, in such instances, the invention expressly includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds described herein, even though only a single tautomeric form may be represented (e.g., alkylation of a ring system may result in alkylation at multiple sites, the invention expressly includes all such reaction products). All such isomeric forms of such compounds are expressly included in the present invention. All crystal forms of the compounds described herein are expressly included in the present invention. Naturally occurring or synthetic isomers can be separated in several ways known in the art. Methods for separating a racemic mixture of two enantiomers include chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (see, e.g., “Chiral Liquid Chromatography,” W. J. Lough, Ed. Chapman and Hall, New York (1989)). Enantiomers can also be separated by classical resolution techniques. For example, formation of diastereomeric salts and fractional crystallization can be used to separate enantiomers. For the separation of enantiomers of carboxylic acids, the diastereomeric salts can be formed by addition of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, and the like. Alternatively, diastereomeric esters can be formed with enantiomerically pure chiral alcohols such as menthol, followed by separation of the diastereomeric esters and hydrolysis to yield the free, enantiomerically enriched carboxylic acid. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts. For example a compound can be resolved to an enantiomeric excess (e.g., 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or greater) via formation of diasteromeric salts, e.g. with a chiral base, e.g., (+) or (−)-methylbenzylamine, or via high performance liquid chromatography using a chiral column. In some embodiments a product is purified directly on a chiral column to provide enantiomerically enriched compound. Combinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The term “stable”, as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and which maintains the integrity of the compound for a sufficient period of time to be useful for the purposes detailed herein (e.g., therapeutic or prophylactic administration to a subject). 3.

In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention include administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein in combination with another pharmaceutically active compound. Examples of pharmaceutically active compounds include compounds known to treat serotonin-related diseases. Other pharmaceutically active compounds that may be used can be found in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Sixteenth Edition, Eds. D. L. Kasper et al. McGraw-Hill Professional, N.Y., NY (2004); and the 2005 Physician's Desk Reference 59th Edition, Thomson Healthcare, 2004, the complete contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. A compound described herein and a pharmaceutically active compound may be administered to the subject in the same pharmaceutical composition or in different pharmaceutical compositions (at the same time or at different times). Determination of a therapeutically effective or a prophylactically effective amount of a compound described herein, can be readily made by the physician or veterinarian (the “attending clinician”), as one skilled in the art, by the use of known techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. The dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient in the judgment of the attending clinician; the severity of the condition being treated and the particular compound being employed. In determining the therapeutically effective amount or dose, and the prophylactically effective amount or dose, a number of factors are considered by the attending clinician, including, but not limited to: the specific serotonin-receptor-related disorder involved; pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the desired time course of treatment; the species of mammal; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of or involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the kind of concurrent treatment (i.e., the interaction of a compound described herein with other co-administered therapeutics); and other relevant circumstances. Treatment can be initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. Compounds determined to be effective for the prevention or treatment of serotonin-receptor-related disorders in animals, e.g., dogs, chickens, and rodents, may also be useful in treatment of serotonin-receptor-related disorders in humans. Those skilled in the art of treating serotonin-receptor-related disorders in humans will know, based upon the data obtained in animal studies, the dosage and route of administration of the compound to humans. In general, the dosage and route of administration in humans is expected to be similar to that in animals. The identification of those patients who are in need of prophylactic treatment for serotonin-receptor-related disorders is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. Certain of the methods for identification of patients which are at risk of developing serotonin-receptor-related disorders which can be treated by the subject method are appreciated in the medical arts, such as family history, and the presence of risk factors associated with the development of that disease state in the subject patient. A clinician skilled in the art can readily identify such candidate patients, by the use of, for example, clinical tests, physical examination and medical/family history. In another aspect, a compound described herein is packaged in a therapeutically effective amount with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The composition may be formulated for treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to a serotonin-receptor-related disorder, and packaged with instructions to treat a subject suffering from or susceptible to a serotonin-receptor-related disorder. In another aspect, the invention provides methods for stimulating or increasing serotonin receptor activity. In one embodiment, a method of increasing serotonin receptor activity (or a serotonin receptor related activity) according to the invention includes contacting cells with a compound capable of increasing serotonin receptor activity. The contacting may be in vitro, e.g., by addition of the compound to a fluid surrounding the cells, for example, to the growth media in which the cells are living or existing. The contacting may also be by directly contacting the compound to the cells. Alternately, the contacting may be in vivo, e.g., by passage of the compound through a subject; for example, after administration, depending on the route of administration, the compound may travel through the digestive tract or the blood stream or may be applied or administered directly to cells in need of treatment. In another aspect, methods of inhibiting a serotonin-receptor-related disorder in a subject include administering an effective amount of a compound described herein (e.g., a compound of any of the formulae herein capable of increasing serotonin receptor activity) to the subject.

The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 1 per cent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 per cent to about 70 per cent, more preferably from about 10 per cent to about 30 per cent. Methods of preparing these compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound described herein(s) with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound described herein with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. Compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound described herein(s) as an active ingredient. A compound may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste. In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, acetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents.

A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of a compound described herein include pharmaceutically-acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. In addition to inert diluents, the oral compositions can include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. Suspensions, in addition to a compound described herein may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds described herein with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent. Compositions of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound described herein include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. A compound described herein may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to a compound described herein, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound described herein, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane. A compound described herein can be alternatively administered by aerosol. This is accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles containing the compound. A nonaqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which can result in degradation of the compound. Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of the agent together with conventional pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular compound, but typically include nonionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, or polyethylene glycol), innocuous proteins like serum albumin, sorbitan esters, oleic acid, lecithin, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions. Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound described herein to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the active ingredient across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the active ingredient in a polymer matrix or gel. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of the invention. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds described herein in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of one or more compounds described herein in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. When a compound described herein is administered as a pharmaceutical, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. Regardless of the route of administration selected, a compound described herein, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Actual dosage levels and time course of administration of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. An exemplary dose range is from 0.1 to 10 mg per day. A preferred dose of a compound described herein is the maximum that a patient can tolerate and not develop serious side effects. Preferably, the compound of the present invention is administered at a concentration or amount of about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight, about 0.01-about 50 mg/kg or about 10 mg-about 30 mg/kg of body weight. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values are also intended to be part of the invention. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples which are intended to illustrate but not limit the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Chemical Synthesis General.

Following an incubation of 15 min after the first injection, 100 μl of the reference agonist at a concentration corresponding to its EC80 will be injected on the 100 μl of the mixture of cell suspension and test compound, for antagonist testing. The resulting emission of light will be recorded using FDSS6000. To standardize the emission of recorded light (determination of the “100% signal”) across plates and across different experiments, some of the wells will contain 100 μM digitonin or a saturating concentration of ATP (20 μM). Plates will also contain the reference agonist at a concentration equivalent to the EC80 obtained during the test validation. Agonist activity of test compound will be expressed as a percentage of the activity of the reference agonist at its EC100 concentration. Antagonist activity of test compound will be expressed as a percentage of the inhibition of reference agonist activity at its EC80 concentration. Example 44 cAMP Assays Dose Response Testing Protocol: Recombinant 5-HT6 cells grown to mid-log phase in culture media without antibiotics are detached with PBS-EDTA, centrifuged and resuspended in assay buffer (KRH, 1 mM IBMX) at a concentration of 2.1×105 cells/ml. The test is performed in 96 well plates. For agonist testing, 12 μl of cells (2,500 cells/well) are mixed with 12 μl of test compound at increasing concentrations. For antagonist testing, 12 μl of cells (2,500 cells/well) are mixed with 6 μl of the test compound at increasing concentrations. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 6 μl of the reference agonist are added at a final agonist concentration corresponding to the historical EC80. The plates are then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After addition of the lysis buffer, cAMP concentrations are estimated, according to the manufacturer specification, with the HTRF kit from Cis-Bio International (cat no62AM2PEB). 5-HT6 reference agonist and antagonist are 5-HT and mianserin, respectively. Quality Control for Compound Testing: On each day of experimentation and prior to the testing of compounds, reference compounds were tested at several concentrations in duplicate (n=2) to obtain a dose-response curve and an estimated EC50 and/or IC50 values. Reference values thus obtained for the test will be compared to historical values obtained from the same receptor and used to validate the experimental session. A session was considered as valid only if the reference value was found to be within a 0.5 logs interval from the historical value. For replicate determinations, the maximum variability tolerated in the test will be of +/−20% around the average of the replicates.

Example 45 cAMP Agonist and Antagonist Mode at 5-HT6 For assessment of 5-HT6 activity, 1321N1 cells stably expressing human 5-HT6 were grown to −90% confluence in a humidified atmosphere at 37° C. with 5% CO2 in F12 nutrient mixture (Ham) containing 10% dialyzed FBS, 400 g/ml G418, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Medium was removed by aspiration, cells were washed 1× with PBS, and dissociated using PBS-EDTA for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then diluted with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 rpm. Cells were suspended in assay buffer containing 300 M Ro-20-1724 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Cells were seeded using a microplate dispenser at a density of 3,750 cells/well in a volume of 5 μl onto 384 well white wall/opaque bottom, small volume plates (Greiner Bio One, Monroe, N.C.). Compound plates for cAMP assays were prepared at 8 mM in 100% DMSO and diluted in assay buffer to the appropriate test concentrations. The final in-well concentration of DMSO was 0.5%. Compounds were tested in duplicate wells using a range of twelve concentrations. Test compounds were transferred to assay plates using an automated liquid handling workstation (Janus; PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass.). After the addition of test compounds, plates were incubated for 15 min in a humidified atmosphere at 37° C. with 5% CO2. After that, either assay buffer (for agonist mode) or the EC80 (15 nM in assay buffer) of 5-HT (for antagonist mode) was added, and the plates incubated for an additional 30 min in a humidified atmosphere at 37° C. with 5% CO2. Homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) (cAMP dynamic 2 kit; Cisbio, Bedford, Mass.) was used to measure the formation of 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) per the manufacturer's instructions. HTRF signal was measured at 620 and 665 nm using an EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer). Compounds were first tested in agonist mode, with Emax defined as percent activation relative to the EC100 (10 M) of 5-HT. Only compounds lacking significant (i.e. <25%) activity in agonist mode were tested in antagonist mode. Maximum inhibition (Imax) in antagonist mode was defined as percent inhibition relative to 10 M of a 5-HT6 antagonist reference compound (SB 258585; Tocris, Ellisville, Mo.). Minimum inhibition in antagonist mode was defined by the EC80 (15 nM) of 5-HT. Example 46 Binding Assay 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C(VSV) and 5-HT6 (Agonist and Antagonist Ligand) All radioligand binding assays were performed at Euroscreen SA (Gosselies, Belgium). Membrane extracts were prepared at Euroscreen from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHOK1) cells stably expressing human 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C(VSV), or 5-HT6 using standard methods. Compounds were solubilized in 100% DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM (master solution). Serial dilutions were made from master solutions in 100% DMSO to obtain intermediate concentrations 200-fold higher than the final concentrations to be tested. Each sample was then diluted 100-fold in the appropriate assay buffer (see below) and dispensed onto the test plate. Compounds were tested in duplicate wells in 8 point dose-response curves at the following concentrations: 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 M. The competitive displacement of radioligand was used to measure the IC50 of test compound. IC50s were converted to absolute inhibition constants (Kis) using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Human 5-HT2A radioligand binding assays were performed by the successive addition of 1) 50 μl of either test compound or reference ligand (5-HT) at increasing concentrations, 2) 25 μl of either diluted agonist ([125I]DOI; Perkin Elmer ET62690) or antagonist ([3H]ketanserin; Perkin Elmer NET-791) radioligand, and 3) 25 μl membrane extracts (5 g/well) into the wells of a 96 well plate (Master Block; Greiner Bio One). All necessary dilutions were made in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.1% ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). The final concentrations of [125I]DOI and [3H]ketanserin were 0.4 and 1 nM, respectively. Plates were incubated for 60 min at 25° C. in a water bath, and then filtered over GF/B filters (Perkin Elmer) presoaked for 2 hr at room temperature in 0.5% polyethyleneimine (PEI) with a Filtermate Harvester (PerkinElmer). Filters were washed 3× with 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris). 50 μl of Microscint 20 (Packard Instrument, Meriden, Conn.) was then added, the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker, and counted using either a TopCount™ or MicroBeta™ (PerkinElmer) for 1 min/well. Human 5-HT2B radioligand binding assays were performed by the successive addition of 1) 50 μl of either test compound or reference ligand (5-HT and methysergide) at increasing concentrations, 2) 25 μl of either diluted agonist ([125I]DOI) or antagonist ([H]mesulergine; Amersham TRK845) radioligand, and 3) 25 μl membrane extracts (7 g/well) into the wells of a 96 well plate. All necessary dilutions were made in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 4 mM CaCl2, 0.1% ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). The final concentrations of [125I]DOI and [3H]mesulergine were 0.2 and 1 nM, respectively. Plates were incubated for 30 min at 37° C. (for agonist) and 60 min at 25° C. (for antagonist) in a water bath, and then filtered over either GF/C filters presoaked in 0.5% PEI for 2 hr at room temperature (for agonist) or GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% BSA for 2 hr at room temperature (for antagonist) with a Filtermate Harvester. Filters were washed 3× with 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris). 50 μl of Microscint 20 was then added, the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker, and counted using either a TopCount™ or MicroBeta™ for 1 min/well. Human 5-HT2C(VSV) radioligand binding assays were performed by the successive addition of 1) 50 μl of either test compound or reference ligand (5-HT) at increasing concentrations, 2) 25 μl of either diluted agonist ([125I]DOI) or antagonist ([3H]mesulergine) radioligand, and 3) 25 μl membrane extracts (8 or 1 g/well for agonist and antagonist radioligands, respectively) into the wells of a 96 well plate. All necessary dilutions were made in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.1% ascorbic acid, pH 7.4). The final concentrations of [125I]DOI and [3H]mesulergine were 0.35 and 1.5 nM, respectively. Plates were incubated for 60 min at either 25° C. (for agonist) or 37° C. (for antagonist) in a water bath, and then filtered over GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% PEI for 2 hr at room temperature with a Filtermate Harvester. Filters were washed 3× with 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris). 50 μl of Microscint 20 was then added, the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature an orbital shaker, and counted using either a TopCount™ or MicroBeta™ for 1 min/well. Human 5-HT6 radioligand binding assays were performed by the successive addition of 1) 50 μl of either test compound or reference ligand (5-HT) at increasing concentrations, 2) 25 μl of diluted radioligand ([3H]LSD; PerkinElmer NET638), and 3) 25 μl membrane extracts (2.5 g/well) into the wells of a 96 well plate. All necessary dilutions were made in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 4 mM CaCl2, 0.1% ascorbic acid, 10 g/ml saponin, pH 7.4). The final concentration of [3H]LSD was 1 nM. Plates were incubated for 60 min at 25° C. in a water bath, and then filtered over GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% PEI for 2 hr at room temperature with a Filtermate Harvester. Filters were washed 6× with 0.5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris). 50 μl of Microscint 20 was then added, the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature an orbital shaker, and counted using either a TopCount™ or MicroBeta™ for 1 min/well. Example 47 Flipr Assays: Agonist Mode at Human 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C(VSV) For assessment of 5-HT2 agonism, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHOK1) cells stably expressing human 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C(VSV), or 5-HT2C(INI) were grown to ˜80-90% confluence in a humidified atmosphere at 37° C. with 5% CO2 in UltraCHO Medium (Lonza, Walkersville, Md.) containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS), 400 g/ml G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Medium was removed by aspiration, cells were washed 1× with PBS, and trypsinized for 5 min at room temperature. After trypsinization, cells were diluted with UltraCHO Medium containing 1% dialyzed FBS (with no G418 or antibiotics) and seeded using a microplate dispenser (Matrix WellMate; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hudson, N.H.) at a density of 22,500 cells/well in a volume of 30 l/well onto 384 well black wall/clear bottom, poly-d-lysine coated plates (BD Biocoat; BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). Plates were then incubated overnight in a humidified atmosphere at 37° C. with 5% CO2. On the day of the experiment, cells were loaded with a membrane-permeable, calcium-sensitive dye (FLIPR Calcium 4 Assay Kit; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions) containing 2.5 mM probenecid and incubated for 1 hr at 37° C. Plates were removed from the incubator and allowed to cool to room temperature prior to assay (˜15 min). Response to test compound was measured using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR384, Molecular Devices). Compound plates for FLIPR assays were prepared at either 2 mM (for 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C) or 8 mM (for 5-HT2B) in 100% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and diluted in assay buffer (1×HBSS/20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to the appropriate test concentrations. The final in-well concentration of DMSO in all assays was 0.5%. Compounds were tested in duplicate wells using a range of twelve concentrations. The statistical parameter exported from each well was the maximum peak height of the response to test compound. The minimum peak height was then subtracted from this value, and expressed as a percentage of the mean maximal response to 10 M 5-HT. Dose-response curves were generated (GraphPad Prism 4; La Jolla, Calif.) and both potency (EC50) and efficacy (Emax) were determined for each test compound. Example 48 Compound Testing Aequorin Assay Compounds were tested in duplicate at 10 M concentration, for agonist activity and 5 μM concentration for antagonist activity at human serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C(edited (e)) and 5-HT2C(non-edited (ne)) receptors with Aequorin Assay and at human 5-HT6 with cAMP assay. DOI was tested in parallel on 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C(e) and 5-HT2C(ne) receptors with Aequorin Assay. All the compounds exemplified in the examples modulated (i. e. activated or inhibited) at least one of 5HT2C, 5HT6, and/or 5HT2A more than or equal to 50% at 10 uM concentration. Compound Testing Flipr assay: Compounds were tested in duplicate, for agonist activity at human serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C(VSV) Representative examples of the present invention are found to have low nM potency for 5-HT2C receptor and are relatively selective for 5-HT2C receptor in comparison to other 5-HT receptor subtype and specifically 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B. Selectivity is demonstrated in agonist activity assay and receptor binding assays. Compound Testing binding assay: Compounds were tested in duplicate, in human serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C(VSV) and 5-HT6.

320 g serve as subjects in this experiment. All rats are allowed to acclimate to the vivarium for at least 1 week prior to study start. Rats are housed singularly in home cages with a layer of absorbent paper covering the floor. The cage does not contain any form of bedding. Water is available at all times by water bottle and food is returned to each animal in the form of pelleted chow. The container along with the food contents is weighed prior to adding it to the cage and is then reweighed at 1, 2, 6 and 24 hours later. Any spilled food is collected and returned to the feeding container prior to weighing. All animals are fasted for 16 hours overnight prior to a single oral gavage dosing (vehicle, plus one to three dose groups). Body weight is measured prior to dosing. Food is returned to all animals ad libitum 2 hours after dosing. Total amount of food consumed is measured for each animal at t=1, 2, 6 and 24 hours after return of food. Body weight is measured again at 24 hours. All animals are clinically observed throughout the study for unusual behavior, mortality or morbidity. The amount of food consumed at each time point and body weight are used as dependent measures in the study. Conditioned Avoidance Response Conditioned Avoidance Response (CAR) training is conducted in Coulbourn two way shuttle chambers. Male, Wistar rats, weighing between 250 and 300 g serve as subjects in the experiments. Rats are habituated to the testing room for 60 minutes prior to behavioral testing. Training consists of a 5 minute habituation period, where the animals are allowed to freely explore both left and right hand chambers. The habituation period is followed by repeated pairings of a CS (light and 80 dB tone) followed 10 seconds later by a 0.8 mA footshock which is terminated upon the animal's escape to the adjacent chamber, or after 10 seconds. If the rat moves to the safe, adjacent chamber within 10 seconds, before the termination of the CS, the shock is avoided and the trial is recorded as an avoidance. If the rat moves to the safe compartment within the first 10 seconds of the shock, the trial is recorded as an escape. If the rat fails to move to the safe compartment during the entire 10 seconds of the shock, the trial is recorded as a failure. Thirty trials are given in each daily training session, and rats are trained until they have reached a criterion of 80% correct avoidance responses on three consecutive days. A test session in which rats are tested on CAR in the presence of compound is conducted after criterion is achieved. On the test day, rats are habituated to the room, then weighed and gavaged with compound (vehicle, plus three dose groups) 30 to 60 minutes before training. Training is conducted as described above. The number of crossings made between chambers during the habituation period, as well as the number of avoidances, escapes and failures is recorded for each rat across training days and on the test day. Percent avoidance, failure and escape are calculated and means and SEM's generated. Data are analyzed using one-way ANOVA and SNK post-hoc analysis as appropriate. Prepulse Inhibition Male, Wistar rats, weighing between 250 and 300 g serve as subjects in the experiments. Rats are habituated to the testing room for 60-120 minutes prior to behavioral testing. Rats are randomized to treatment groups based on a pre-determined startle response, weighed, gavaged with compound (vehicle, plus three dose groups) and then placed in prepulse inhibition chambers. Kinder Scientific chambers are used for the experiment. Kinder software controls the delivery of all stimuli to the animals and records the response. Training consists of a 5 minute habituation period during which a 65 dB background noise is continuously present. This background noise remains present throughout the entire testing session. After the habituation period, the rats receive a series of five, 40-ms, 120 dB bursts of white noise to partially habituate the animals to the startle-eliciting stimulus. After these stimuli are presented, the training session proper begins. For the training session, a 10-ms prepulse at 68, 71 or 80 dB, followed 100-ms later by a 120 dB, 40-ms startle stimulus is presented. Startle stimulus and no-stimulus trials are also included in the testing session. The stimuli are presented in random order with interstimulus intervals averaging 15 seconds. Levels of prepulse inhibition are determined by the formula (100−((prepulse pulse/alone×100)) and are expressed as percent inhibition. Spontaneous Locomotion Male, Wistar rats, weighing between 250 and 300 g serve as subjects in the experiments. Rats are habituated to the testing room for 60-120 minutes prior to behavioral testing. Rats are weighed and gavaged with compound (vehicle, plus three dose groups) and are then placed in automated activity monitoring chambers (Kinder Scientific). The activity levels of the rat, including horizontal movements, total distance moved, total rest time, fine movements and rears are recorded for two consecutive hours. The rats are then removed from the apparatus and returned to their home cages. Drug-Induced Hyperlocomotion Male, Wistar rats, weighing between 250 and 300 g serve as subjects in the experiments. Rats are habituated to the testing room for 60-120 minutes prior to behavioral testing. Fifteen to thirty minutes prior to testing, rats are weighed and gavaged with compound (vehicle, plus three dose groups) and are placed in automated activity monitoring chambers (Kinder Scientific) for a 30 minute baseline period. At the end of the baseline period, the animals are removed from the chamber and injected with a psychotomimetic (eg, PCP or d-amphetamine). The rats are then returned to the chambers where their activity levels are monitored for two consecutive hours. Novel Object Recognition Male, Wistar rats, weighing between 250 and 300 g serve as subjects for the experiments. Rats are habituated to the testing room for 60-120 minutes prior to behavioral testing. Testing is conducted in large, circular arenas (80 cm in diameter). Training consists of three sessions: habituation, sample and test. For habituation, the rats are placed into an empty test chamber and allowed to explore for a 10 minute period. The sample trial, in which two large, identical objects are placed inside the arena, takes place 24 hours after habituation. The animal is placed inside the arena with the two identical objects and allowed to explore for 5 minutes. The number of approaches and the time spent sniffing each of the objects is recorded by automated software (CleverSys, Inc). Twenty-four hours after the sample phase, the rat is returned to the arena for the test trial. For the test trial, two objects, one familiar object that the animal saw in the sample phase, and one novel object that the animal has not seen before, are placed inside the arena. The animal is placed into the arena with the objects and allowed to explore for a 5 minute period. The number of approaches and time spent sniffing each of the objects is recorded. Compound (vehicle plus three dose groups, via oral gavage) may be administered either before or after the sample trial, or before the test trial. The time the rat spends sniffing each object is used to calculate a discrimination index ((time exploring novel−time exploring familiar)/total exploration time) that is used to determine preference for the familiar versus the novel objects.
