Method 26
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[N-((S)-1-{N-[(S)-1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)ethyl]carbamoyl}ethyl)carbamoyl]benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-[N-(R)-α-carboxybenzyl) carbamoylmethoxy]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Example 25; 58 mg, 0.091 mmol), tert-butyl L-alanyl-L-alaninate hydrochloride (27.5 mg, 0.11 mmol) and N-methylmorpholine (20 µl, 0.18 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (2 ml). TBTU (35 mg, 0.18 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 2-3 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The product was purified using a pre-packed ISOLUTE column (Silica, 2g) and eluted with a stepwise gradient using DCM:EtOAc 100:0, 95:5,90:10 and 80:20 to give 34 mg (45%) of the title compound M/z 838.5.
