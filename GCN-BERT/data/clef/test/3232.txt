Synthesis of Compound 58
A solution compound 57 (20.1 mg 0.054 mmol) and sodium acetate (6.3 mg, 0.047 mmol) in acetic anhydride (10 mL) was heated to 100° C. for 2 hours. Once the reaction was complete, the reaction solution was slowly poured into crushed ice with stirring, and iced water was added. Solid was precipitated out after 1 hour stirring. The solid residue was filtered and washed with iced water (15 mL×3) to give the compound 58 (9.1 mg, 46.1%) as a white solid. LC-MS m/z (ES+), 338.13 (M+H)+.
