FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compounds, compositions and methods useful for controlling biofilms and other microorganisms. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms that are commonly found on a variety of substrates or surfaces that are moist or submerged (Musk et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2006, 13, 2163; Donlan et al., Clin. Microbiol. Rev., 2002, 15, 167). Though primarily populated by bacteria, biofilms can also contain many different individual types of microorganisms, e.g., bacteria, archaea, protozoa and algae. The formation of biofilms can be thought of as a developmental process in which a few free-swimming (planktonic) bacteria adhere to a solid surface and, in response to appropriate signals, initiate the formation of a complex sessile microcolony existing as a community of bacteria and other organisms. Bacteria within biofilms are usually embedded within a matrix, which can consist of protein, polysaccharide, nucleic acids, or combinations of these macromolecules. The matrix is a critical feature of the biofilm that protects the inhabiting organisms from antiseptics, microbicides, and host cells. It has been estimated that bacteria within biofilms are upwards of 1.000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics (Rasmussen et al., Int. J. Med. Microbiol., 2006, 296, 149). Biofilms play a significant role in infectious disease. It is estimated that biofilms account for between 50-80% of microbial infections in the body, and that the cost of these infections exceeds $1 billion annually. For example, persistent infections of indwelling medical devices remain a serious problem for patients, because eradication of these infections is virtually impossible. A few diseases in which biofilms have been implicated include endocarditis, otitis media, chronic prostatitis, periodontal disease, chronic urinary tract infections, and cystic fibrosis. The persistence of biofilm populations is linked to their inherent insensitivity to antiseptics, antibiotics, and other antimicrobial compounds or host cells. Cystic fibrosis (CF), with 7 million asymptomatic heterozygous carriers, is one of the most common genetic diseases in the United States. Despite significant progress in the management of the symptoms of CF, virtually all CF patients succumb to chronic pulmonary infections. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the airways of CF patients are particularly susceptible to bacterial colonization. CF patients typically become infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Burkholderia cepacia complex, and nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, as the patients age, Pseudomona aeruginosa becomes the predominant pulmonary pathogen, present in up to 85% of cultures from patients with advanced disease. Once colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the organism persists for many years or decades and is never eradicated. This persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been linked to its ability to form biofilms. Complications arising from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are the leading cause of death among CF patents. Deleterious effects of biofilms are also found in non-medical settings. For example, biofilms are a major problem in the shipping industry. Biofilms form on and promote the corrosion of ship hulls and also increase the roughness of the hulls, increasing the drag on the ships and thereby increasing fuel costs. The biofilms can also promote the attachment of larger living structures, such as barnacles, to the hull. Fuel can account for half of the cost of marine shipping, and the loss in fuel efficiency due to biofilm formation is substantial. One method of controlling biofilms is to simply scrape the films off of the hulls. However, this method is costly and time-consuming, and can promote the spread of troublesome non-native species in shipping waters. Another method involves the use of antifouling coatings containing tin. However, tin-based coatings are now disfavored due to toxicity concerns. Given the breadth of detrimental effects caused by bacterial biofilms, there has been an effort to develop small molecules that will inhibit their formation (Musk et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2006, 13, 2163). The underlying principle is that if bacteria can be maintained in the planktonic state, they will either not attach to a target surface and/or they can be killed by a lower dose of microbicide. Despite the extent of biofilm driven problems, examples of structural scaffolds that inhibit biofilm formation are rare (Musk et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2006, 13, 2163). The few known examples include the homoserine lactones (Geske et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2005, 127, 12762), which are naturally-occurring bacterial signaling molecules that bacteria use in quorum sensing (Dong et al., J. Microbiol., 2005, 43, 101; Nealson et al., J. Bacteriol., 1970, 104, 313), brominated furanones isolated from the macroalga Delisea pulchra (Hentzer et al., Microbiology-Sgm, 2002, 148, 87), and ursene triterpenes from the plant Diospyros dendo (Hu et al., J. Nat. Prod., 2006, 69, 118), While the focus has predominantly been on designing small molecules that inhibit the formation of biofilms, one of the more significant challenges is the development of a small molecule that disperses pre-formed biofilms. None of the small molecules noted above have been previously reported to disperse an existing biofilm. In addition, bacteria have an unparalleled ability to overcome foreign chemical insult. For example, resistance to vancomycin, “the antibiotic of last resort,” has become more prevalent, and strains of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have become a serious health risk. It has been predicted that it is simply a matter of time before different bacterial strains develop vancomycin resistance, and the safety net that vancomycin has provided for decades in antibiotic therapy will no longer be available. Therefore, the identification of chemical architectures useful to inhibit biofilm development is needed. Because of their natural resistance to antibiotics, phagocytic cells, and other biocides, biofilms are difficult, if not impossible, to eradicate. Therefore, the identification of compounds that control biofilm formation is of critical need.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is further described below. All patent references referred to in this patent application are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety as if set forth fully herein. A. DEFINITIONS “Triazole” refers to the commonly known structures: “Imidazole” refers to the commonly known structure: “H” refers to a hydrogen atom. “C” refers to a carbon atom, “N” refers to a nitrogen atom. “O” refers to an oxygen atom. “Halo” refers to F, Cl, Br or I. The term “hydroxy,” as used herein, refers to an —OH moiety. “Br” refers to a bromine atom. “Cl” refers to a chlorine atom, “I” refers to an iodine atom. “F” refers to a fluorine atom. An “acyl group” is intended to mean a group —C(O)—R, where R is a suitable substituent (for example, an acetyl group, a propionyl group, a butyroyl group, a benzoyl group, or an alkylbenzoyl group). “Alkyl,” as used herein, refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon containing from 1 or 2 to 10 or 20 or more carbon atoms (e.g., C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, etc.). Representative examples of alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, 3-methylhexyl, 2,2-dimethylpentyl, 2,3-dimethylpentyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, and the like. In some embodiments, alkyl groups as described herein are optionally substituted (e.g., from 1 to 3 or 4 times) with independently selected H, halo, hydroxy, acyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclo, aryl, heteroaryl, alkoxy, amino, amide, thiol, sulfone, sulfoxide, oxo, oxy, nitro, carbonyl, carboxy, amino acid sidechain, amino acid and peptide. As generally understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, “saturation” refers to the state in which all available valence bonds of an atom (e.g., carbon) are attached to other atoms. Similarly, “unsaturation” refers to the state in which not all the available valence bonds are attached to other atoms; in such compounds the extra bonds usually take the form of double or triple bonds (usually with carbon). For example, a carbon chain is “saturated” when there are no double or triple bonds present along the chain or directly connected to the chain (e.g., a carbonyl), and is “unsaturated” when at least one double or triple bond is present along the chain or directly connected to the chain (e.g., a carbonyl). Further, the presence or absence of a substituent depending upon chain saturation will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to depend upon the valence requirement of the atom or atoms to which the substituent binds (e.g., carbon). The term “optionally substituted” indicates that the specified group is either unsubstituted, or substituted by one or more suitable substituents. A “substituent” is an atom or atoms substituted in place of a hydrogen atom on the parent chain or cycle of an organic molecule, for example, H, hydroxy, acyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclo, aryl, heteroaryl, alkoxy, amino, amide, thiol, sulfone, sulfoxide, oxo, oxy, nitro, carbonyl, carboxy, amino acid sidechain, amino acid and peptide. “Alkenyl,” as used herein, refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon containing from 1 or 2 to 10 or 20 or more carbons, and containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond, formed structurally, for example, by the replacement of two hydrogens.

C. COMPOSITIONS In some embodiments, biofilm preventing, removing or inhibiting compositions are provided, comprising a carrier and an effective amount of active compound. “Biofilm” or “biofilms” refer to communities of microorganisms that are attached to a substrate. The microorganisms often excrete a protective and adhesive matrix of polymeric compounds. They often have structural heterogeneity, genetic diversity, and complex community interactions. “Biofilm preventing”, “biofilm removing”, “biofilm inhibiting”, “biofilm reducing”, “biofilm resistant”, “biofilm controlling” or “antifouling” refer to prevention of biofilm formation, inhibition of the establishment or growth of a biofilm, or decrease in the amount of organisms that attach and/or grow upon a substrate, up to and including the complete removal of the biofilm. As used herein, a “substrate” can include any living or nonliving structure. For example, biofilms often grow on synthetic materials submerged in an aqueous solution or exposed to humid air, but they also can form as floating mats on a liquid surface, in which case the microorganisms are adhering to each other or to the adhesive matrix characteristic of a biofilm. An “effective amount” of a biofilm preventing, removing or inhibiting composition is that amount which is necessary to carry out the composition's function of preventing, removing or inhibiting a biofilm. In some embodiments, the carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” as used herein refers to a carrier that, when combined with an active compound of the present invention, facilitates the application or administration of that active compound for its intended purpose to prevent or inhibit biofilm formation, or remove an existing biofilm. The active compounds may be formulated for administration in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in accordance with known techniques. See, e.g., Remington, The Science And Practice of Pharmacy (9th Ed. 1995). The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier must, of course, also be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the composition. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound as a unit-dose composition, for example, a tablet, which may contain from 0.01 or 0.5% to 95% or 99% by weight of the active compound. One or more active compounds may be included in the compositions of the invention, which may be prepared by any of the well-known techniques of pharmacy comprising admixing the components, optionally including one or more accessory ingredients. In general, compositions may be prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules containing the active compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid binder. The compositions of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), vaginal, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous), topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces) and transdermal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular active compound that is being used. Preferred routes of parenteral administration include intrathecal injection and intraventricular injection into a ventricle of the brain. Compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy, which includes the step of bringing into association the active compound and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more accessory ingredients as noted above). Compositions suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising the active compound in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. Compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous and non-aqueous injection solutions of the active compound, which preparations are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes that render the composition isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The compositions may be presented in unit/dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water-for-injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. For example, in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an injectable, stable, sterile composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), Formula (II) or Formula (III), or a salt or prodrug thereof, in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate that is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a liquid composition suitable for injection thereof into a subject. The unit dosage form typically comprises from about 10 mg to about 10 grams of the compound or salt. When the compound or salt is substantially water-insoluble, a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent that is physiologically acceptable may be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. One such useful emulsifying agent is phosphatidyl choline. Compositions suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. These may be prepared by mixing the active compound with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting mixture. Compositions suitable for topical application to the skin preferably take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers that may be used include petroleum jelly, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, transdermal enhancers, and combinations of two or more thereof. Compositions suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. Compositions suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by iontophoresis (see, for example, Pharmaceutical Research 3 (6):318 (1986)) and typically take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound. Also provided in some embodiments are compositions comprising an active compound and a biocide. A “biocide” as used herein refers to a substance with the ability to kill or to inhibit the growth of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungal cells, protozoa, etc.), which substance is not an active compound give above in Section B. Common biocides include oxidizing and non-oxidizing chemicals. Examples of oxidizing biocides include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone. Examples of non-oxidizing biocides include quaternary ammonium compounds, formaldehyde, and anionic and non-anionic surface agents. Chlorine is the most common biocide used in sanitizing water systems. An “antibiotic” as used herein is a type of “biocide.” Common antibiotics include aminoglycosides, carbacephems (e.g., loracarbef), carbapenems, cephalosporins, glycopeptides (e.g., teicoplanin and vancomycin), macrolides, monobactams (e.g., aztreonam) penicillins, polypeptides (e.g., bacitracin, colistin, polymyxin B), quinolones, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, etc. Antibiotics treat infections by either killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms. Many act to inhibit cell wall synthesis or other vital protein synthesis of the microorganisms. Aminoglycosides are commonly used to treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, particularly Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Examples of aminoglycosides include, but are not limited to amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, and paromomycin.

However, for use in the present invention the compositions further comprise one or more biofilm inhibiting compounds as described herein, which may be carried by or dispersed in the solvent and/or resin, so that the biofilm inhibiting compounds are dispersed or distributed on the substrate an article coated. A resin may carry the biofilm inhibiting compounds through covalent attachment through means well known in the art. The resin may comprise, for example, a polymeric material. A polymeric material is a material that is comprised of large molecules made from associated smaller repeating structural units, often covalently linked. Common examples of polymeric materials are unsaturated polyester resins, and epoxy resins. Any suitable article can be coated, in whole or in part, with a composition of the invention. Suitable articles include, but are not limited to, automobiles and airplanes (including substrates such as wing and propeller surfaces for aerodynamic testing), vessel hulls (including interior and exterior surfaces thereof), pressure vessels (including interior and exterior surfaces thereof) medical implants, windmills, etc. Coating of the article with the composition can be carried out by any suitable means, such as by brushing, spraying, electrostatic deposition, dip coating, doctor blading, etc. D. METHODS OF USE Methods of controlling biofilm formation on a substrate are disclosed, comprising the step of administering an active compound to a substrate in an amount effective to inhibit biofilm formation. A “substrate” as used herein is a base on which an organism, such as those commonly found in biofilms, may live. The term “substrate,” as used herein, refers to any substrate, whether in an industrial or a medical setting, that provides or can provide an interface between an object and a fluid, permitting at least intermittent contact between the object and the fluid. A substrate, as understood herein, further provides a plane whose mechanical structure, without further treatment, is compatible with the adherence of microorganisms. Substrates compatible with biofilm formation may be natural or synthetic, and may be smooth or irregular. Fluids contacting the substrates can be stagnant or flowing, and can flow intermittently or continuously, with laminar or turbulent or mixed flows. A substrate upon which a biofilm forms can be dry at times with sporadic fluid contact, or can have any degree of fluid exposure including total immersion. Fluid contact with the substrate can take place via aerosols or other means for air-borne fluid transmission. Biofilm formation with health implications can involve those substrates in all health-related environments, including substrates found in medical environments and those substrates in industrial or residential environments that are involved in those functions essential to human well being, for example, nutrition, sanitation and the prevention of disease. Substrates found in medical environments include the inner and outer aspects of various instruments and devices, whether disposable or intended for repeated uses. Examples include the entire spectrum of articles adapted for medical use, including scalpels, needles, scissors and other devices used in invasive surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedures; implantable medical devices, including artificial blood vessels, catheters and other devices for the removal or delivery of fluids to patients, artificial hearts, artificial kidneys, orthopedic pins, plates and implants; catheters and other tubes (including urological and biliary tubes, endotracheal tubes, peripherably insertable central venous catheters, dialysis catheters, long term tunneled central venous catheters, peripheral venous catheters, short term central venous catheters, arterial catheters, pulmonary catheters, Swan-Ganz catheters, urinary catheters, peritoneal catheters), urinary devices (including long term urinary devices, tissue bonding urinary devices, artificial urinary sphincters, urinary dilators), shunts (including ventricular or arterio-venous shunts); prostheses (including breast implants, penile prostheses, vascular grafting prostheses, heart valves, artificial joints, artificial larynxes, otological implants), vascular catheter ports, wound drain tubes, hydrocephalus shunts, pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, and the like. Other examples will be readily apparent to practitioners in these arts. Substrates found in the medical environment also include the inner and outer aspects of pieces of medical equipment, medical gear worn or carried by personnel in the health care setting. Such substrates can include counter tops and fixtures in areas used for medical procedures or for preparing medical apparatus, tubes and canisters used in respiratory treatments, including the administration of oxygen, of solubilized drugs in nebulizers and of anesthetic agents. Also included are those substrates intended as biological barriers to infectious organisms in medical settings, such as gloves, aprons and faceshields. Commonly used materials for biological barriers may be latex-based or non-latex based. Vinyl is commonly used as a material for non-latex surgical gloves. Other such substrates can include handles and cables for medical or dental equipment not intended to be sterile. Additionally, such substrates can include those non-sterile external substrates of tubes and other apparatus found in areas where blood or body fluids or other hazardous biomaterials are commonly encountered. Substrates in contact with liquids are particularly prone to biofilm formation. As an example, those reservoirs and tubes used for delivering humidified oxygen to patients can bear biofilms inhabited by infectious agents. Dental unit waterlines similarly can bear biofilms on their substrates, providing a reservoir for continuing contamination of the system of flowing an aerosolized water used in dentistry. Sprays, aerosols and nebulizers are highly effective in disseminating biofilm fragments to a potential host or to another environmental site. It is especially important to health to prevent biofilm formation on those substrates from where biofilm fragments can be carried away by sprays, aerosols or nebulizers contacting the substrate. Other substrates related to health include the inner and outer aspects of those articles involved in water purification, water storage and water delivery, and articles involved in food processing. Substrates related to health can also include the inner and outer aspects of those household articles involved in providing for nutrition, sanitation or disease prevention. Examples can include food processing equipment for home use, materials for infant care, tampons and toilet bowls. “Substrate” as used herein also refers to a living substrate, such as the inner ear of a patent. Substrates can be smooth or porous, soft or hard. Substrates can include a drainpipe, glaze ceramic, porcelain, glass, metal, wood, chrome, plastic, vinyl, Formica® brand laminate, or any other material that may regularly come in contact with an aqueous solution in which biofilms may form and grow. The substrate can be a substrate commonly found on household items such as shower curtains or liners, upholstery, laundry, and carpeting. A substrate on which biofilm preventing, removing or inhibiting is important is that of a ship hull. Biofilms, such as those of Halomonas pacifica, promote the corrosion of the hull of ships and also increase the roughness of the hull, increasing the drag on the ship and thereby increasing fuel costs. The biofilm can also promote the attachment of larger living structures such as barnacles on the ship hull. Fuel can account for half of the cost of marine shipping, and the loss in fuel efficiency due to biofilm formation is substantial. Substrates on which biofilms can adhere include those of living organisms, as in the case of humans with chronic infections caused by biofilms, as discussed above. Biofilms can also form on the substrates of food contact surfaces, such as those used for processing seafood, and also on food products themselves. Examples of seafood products that may have biofilm contamination include oysters. Human infections caused by the ingestion of raw oysters has been linked to Vibrio vulnificus bacterium. Vibrio bacteria attach to algae and plankton in the water and transfer to the oysters and fish that feed on these organisms. Other examples of substrates or devices on which biofilms can adhere can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,814,668 and 7,087,661; and U.S. Pat. Appln. Publication Nos. 2006/0228384 and 2006/0018945, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, methods of enhancing the effects of a biocide are disclosed, comprising the step of administering an active compound in combination with a biocide, the active compound being administered in an amount effective to enhance the effects of the biocide. “Administering” or “administration of” an active compound and/or biocide as used herein in inclusive of contacting, applying, etc. (e.g., contacting with an aqueous solution, contacting with a surface (e.g., a hospital surface such as a table, instrumentation, etc.)), in addition to providing to a subject (for example, to a human subject in need of treatment for a microbial infection). “Enhancing” the effects of a biocide by administering an active compound in combination with the biocide refers to increasing the effectiveness of the biocide, such that the microorganism killing and/or growth inhibition is higher at a certain concentration of the biocide administered in combination with the active compound than without. In some embodiments, a bacteria or other microorganism is “sensitized” to the effects of a biocide, such that the bacteria or other microorganism that was resistant to the biocide prior to administering the active compound (e.g., little to none, or less than 20, 10, 5 or 1% are killed upon application) is rendered vulnerable to that biocide upon or after administering the active compound (e.g., greater than 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 95% or more are killed). As used herein, the administration of two or more compounds (inclusive of active compounds and biocides) “in combination” means that the two compounds are administered closely enough in time that the administration of or presence of one alters the biological effects of the other. The two compounds may be administered simultaneously (concurrently) or sequentially. Simultaneous administration of the compounds may be carried out by mixing the compounds prior to administration, or by administering the compounds at the same point in time but at different anatomic sites or using different routes of administration, or administered at times sufficiently close that the results observed are indistinguishable from those achieved when the compounds are administered at the same point in time. Sequential administration of the compounds may be carried out by administering, e.g., an active compound at some point in time prior to administration of a biocide, such that the prior administration of active compound enhances the effects of the biocide (e.g., percentage of microorganisms killed and/or slowing the growth of microorganisms). In some embodiments, an active compound is administerd at some point in time prior to the initial administration of a biocide. Alternatively, the biocide may be administered at some point in time prior to the administration of an active compound, and optionally, administered again at some point in time after the administration of an active compound. Also disclosed is a method of controlling biofilm formation wherein the biofilm comprises Gram-negative bacteria. “Gram-negative” bacteria are those that do not retain crystal violet dye after an alcohol wash in the Gram staining protocol. This is due to structural properties in the cell walls of the bacteria. Many genera and species of Gram-negative bacteria are pathogenic. Gram-negative bacteria include members of the phylum proteobacteria, which include genus members Escherichia, Salmonella, Vibrio, and Helicobacter. A “genus” is a category of biological classification ranking between the family and the species, comprising structurally or phylogenetically related species, or an isolated species exhibiting unusual differentiation. It is usually designated by a Latin or latinized capitalized singular noun. Examples of genera of biofilm-forming bacteria affected by active compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, Pseudomonas, Bordetella, Vibrio, Haemophilus, Halomonas, and Acinetobacter. “Species” refer to a category of biological classification ranking below the genus, and comprise members that are structurally or phylogenetically related, or an isolated member exhibiting unusual differentiation. Species are commonly designated by a two-part name, which name includes the capitalized and italicized name of the genus in which the species belongs as the first word in the name, followed by the second word that more specifically identifies the member of the genus, which is not capitalized. Examples of species of bacteria capable of forming biofilms that are affected by active compounds of the present invention include Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella pertussis, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus, Haemophilus influenzae, Halomonas pacifica, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Other examples of Gram-negative bacteria affected by active compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, bacteria of the genera Klebsiella, Proteus, Neisseria, Helicobacter, Brucella, Legionella, Campylobacter, Francisella, Pasteurella, Yersinia, Bartonella, Bacteroides, Streptobacillus, Spirillum, Moraxella and Shigella. Examples of Gram-positive bacteria affected by active compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, bacteria of the genera Listeria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Clostridium. Examples include, but are not limited to, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium tetani, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium ulcerans, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Additional bacteria affected by active compounds of the present invention also include bacterial genera including, but not limited to, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Nocardia and Streptomyces. A method for treating a chronic bacterial infection in a subject in need thereof is disclosed, comprising administering active compound to said subject in an amount effective to inhibit, reduce, or remove a biofilm component of said chronic bacterial infection. “Treating” as used herein refers to any type of activity that imparts a benefit to a patient afflicted with a disease, including improvement in the condition of the patient (e.g., in one or more symptoms), delay in the progression of the disease, delay in onset of the disease, etc. The present invention is primarily concerned with the treatment of human subjects, but the invention may also be carried out on animal subjects, particularly mammalian subjects (e.g., mice, rats, dogs, cats, rabbits, and horses), avian subjects (e.g., parrots, geese, quail, pheasant), livestock (e.g., pigs, sheep, goats, cows, chickens, turkey, duck, ostrich, emu), reptile and amphibian subjects, for veterinary purposes or animal husbandry, and for drug screening and drug development purposes. A “chronic bacterial infection” is a bacterial infection that is of a long duration or frequent recurrence. For example, a chronic middle ear infection, or otitis media, can occur when the Eustachian tube becomes blocked repeatedly due to allergies, multiple infections, ear trauma, or swelling of the adenoids. The definition of “long duration” will depend upon the particular infection. For example, in the case of a chronic middle ear infection, it may last for weeks to months. Other known chronic bacterial infections include urinary tract infection (most commonly caused by Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus saprophyticus), gastritis (most commonly caused by Helicobacter pylori), respiratory infection (such as those commonly afflicting patents with cystic fibrosis, most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeuroginosa), cystitis (most commonly caused by Escherichia coli), pyelonephritis (most commonly caused by Proteus species, Escherichia coli and/or Pseudomonas species), osteomyelitis (most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, but also by Escherichia coli), bacteremia, skin infection, rosacea, acne, chronic wound infection, infectious kidney stones (can be caused by Proteus mirabilis), bacterial endocarditis, and sinus infection. A common infection afflicting pigs is atrophic rhinitis (caused by Bordatella species, e.g. Bordatella bronchiseptica, Bordatella rhinitis, etc.). Various nosocomial infections that are especially prevalent in intensive care units implicate Acinetobacter species such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter lwoffi. Acinetobacter baumanni is a frequent cause of nosocomial pneumonia, and can also cause skin and wound infections and bacteremia. Acinetobacter lwoffi causes meningitis. The Acinetobacter species are resistant to many classes of antibiotics. The CDC has reported that bloodstream infections implicating Acinetobacter baumanni were becoming more prevalent among service members injured during the military action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of nosocomial infections, often causing post-surgical wound infections. Staphylococcus aureus can also cause variety of other infections in humans (e.g., skin infections), and can contribute to mastitis in dairy cows. Staphylococcus aureus has become resistant to many of the commonly used antibiotics. Also disclosed is a method of clearing a preformed biofilm from a substrate comprising the step of administering an effective amount of compound to said substrate, wherein said effective amount will reduce the amount of said biofilm on said substrate. “Preformed biofilm” is a biofilm that has begun to adhere to a substrate. The biofilm may or may not yet be fully formed. E. DEVICES Medical devices comprising a substrate and an effective amount of active compound are also disclosed. “Medical device” as used herein refers to an object that is inserted or implanted in a subject or applied to a surface of a subject. Common examples of medical devices include stents, fasteners, ports, catheters, scaffolds and grafts. A “medical device substrate” can be made of a variety of biocompatible materials, including, but not limited to, metals, ceramics, polymers, gels, and fluids not normally found within the human body. Examples of polymers useful in fabricating medical devices include such polymers as silicones, rubbers, latex, plastics, polyanhydrides, polyesters, polyorthoesters, polyamides, polyacrylonitrile, polyurethanes, polyethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylenetetraphthalate, etc. Medical devices can also be fabricated using naturally-occurring materials or treated with naturally-occurring materials. Medical devices can include any combination of artificial materials, e.g., combinations selected because of the particular characteristics of the components. Medical devices can be intended for short-term or long-term residence where they are positioned. A hip implant is intended for several decades of use, for example. By contrast, a tissue expander may only be needed for a few months, and is removed thereafter. Some examples of medical devices are found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,081,133 (Chinn et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 6,562,295 (Neuberger); and U.S. Pat. No. 6,387,363 (Gruskin); each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. F. COVALENT COUPLING OF ACTIVE COMPOUNDS In some embodiments, active compounds as described herein are covalently coupled to substrates. Examples of substrates include solid supports and polymers. The polymers, typically organic polymers, may be in solid form, liquid form, dispersed or solubilized in a solvent (e.g., to form a coating composition as described above), etc. The solid support may include the substrate examples as described above to be coated with or treated with active compounds of the invention. Covalent coupling can be carried out by any suitable technique. Active compounds of the present invention may be appended to a substrate via aldehyde condensation, amide or peptide bond, carbon-carbon bond, or any suitable technique commonly used in the art. For example, active compounds containing a terminal alkyne can be covalently linked to a substrate containing a terminal azide via click reaction conditions as shown (with the dark bar representing the substrate): Similarly, active compounds containing a terminal azide can be covalently linked to a substrate containing a terminal alkyne employing the click reaction as shown: This listing of examples of reactions that can be used to append active compounds of the present invention to a substrate is not intended to be exhaustive. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate various other methods of carrying out these teachings. See also U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0181923 to Melander et al., which is incorporated by reference herein. Further examples and explanations of these types of reactions can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,136,157 (Lindeberg et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 7,115,653 (Baxter et al.), which are each hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Some aspects of the present invention are described in more detail in the following non-limiting examples. Example 1 Herein we report the development of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugates that inhibit and disperse biofilms from bacteria across order and phylum without inducing bacterial death. Our recent work has identified imidazole derivative compounds that prevent, remove, and/or inhibit the formation of biofilms, including TAGE, dihydrosventrin (DHS), and RA-11. See U.S. Patent Application Publication No, 2008/0181923 to Melander et al. We have begun to investigate if modifications to the core DHS structure will deliver derivatives with enhanced anti-biofilm activities (J. J. Richards, T. E. Ballard, C. Melander, Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry 2008, 6, 1356-1363). One of the first structural variations we have studied is replacement of the pyrrole subunit with a triazole subunit. Herein we detail the development of the synthetic protocols necessary to access 2-aminoimidazole/triazole (2-AIT) conjugates, the application of these methods to the synthesis of a focused 2-AIT library, and the discovery small molecules that inhibit and disperse bacterial biofilms across both order and phylum. We first developed synthetic protocols necessary to access 2-AIT conjugates. There is a paucity of reactions that have been reported to be compatible with 2-aminoimidazoles. To test the applicability of the Cu(I)-catalyzed [3+2] alkyne/azide cycloaddition (Click reaction) (H. C. Kolb, M. G. Finn, K. B. Sharpless, Angewandte Chemie-International Edition 2001, 11, 2004-2021; V. O. Rodionov, V. V. Fokin, M. G. Finn, Angewandte Chemie-International Edition 2005, 15, 2210-2215), we synthesized the alkyne derived 2-aminoimidzole 1 and tested its ability to participate in a Cu(I)-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition with benzyl azide. The alkyne derived 2-aminoimidazole (2-AI) was synthesized as outlined in Scheme 1. Amino acid 2 (S. Kotha, S. Halder, E. Brahmachary, Tetrahedron 2002, 45, 9203-9208) was subjected to small scale Akabori reduction (S. Akabori, Berichte Der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 1933, 66, 151-158), which, followed by condensation with cyanamide (Y. Xu Yz, K. Yakushijin, D. A. Home, J Org Chem 1997, 3, 456-464) delivered the target alkyne 2-AI 1 in 88% yield. With 1 in hand, we explored various conditions to elicit the Cu-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition between 1 and benzyl azide (Table 1). TABLE 1 Scale Cu(I) (mg) Sourcea Solvent Base Temp Yield 20 CuI THF DIEA RT NR 20 CuI THF DIEA 40° C. NR 20 CuSO4/NaAsc EtOH/H2O (1:1) — RT NR 20 CuSO4/NaAsc EtOH/H2O (1:1) — 40° C. 86% 100 CuSO4/NaAsc EtOH/H2O (1:1) — 40° C. Decomp 100 CuSO4/NaAsc t-BuOH/H2O/ — RT 93% CH2Cl2 (1:1:1) aNaAsc = Sodium Ascorbate Reactions in THF using Cu(I) yielded no reaction and only returned starting material. We then switched to using CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate in a 1:1 solvent mixture of H2O/EtOH. Again, no reaction was noted. However, when the reaction was heated to 40° C. we noted clean conversion to the desired 2-AIT conjugate 3 in 86% yield. Unfortunately, when the reaction was scaled up, we observed a significant amount of decomposition. Room temperature click reactions have been noted when a 1:1:1 solvent mixture of H2O/EtOH/CH2Cl2 (B. Y. Lee, S. R. Park, H. B. Jeon, K. S. Kim, Tetrahedron Letters 2006, 29, 5105-5109) is employed instead of the 1:1 H2O/EtOH mixture. When these reaction conditions were tested, we observed conversion to 3 in 93% yield. With the methodology established to access 2-AIT conjugates, we employed the synthetic approach outlined in Scheme 1 to synthesize 2-AI alkynes 4 and 5, in which we systematically extended the methylene space between the alkyne and the 2-AI. The click reaction was then performed between each of the 2-AI alkynes and 12 azides to yield an initial 2-AIT library (shown below). Each compound was characterized (1H NMR, 13C NMR, HRMS) prior to screening. Each 2-AIT conjugate was initially screened at 300 μM for their ability to inhibit P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 biofilms, A. baumannii biofilms and B. bronchiseptica Rb50 biofilms using a crystal violet reporter assay (G. A. O'Toole, R. Kolter, Molecular Microbiology 1998, 2, 295-304). From this initial library screen, we observed that 2-AIT conjugate 6 showed the most promise, and was most active against A. baumanii, with an observed IC50 of 12 μM. This is an order of magnitude increase in activity when compared to DHS (J. J. Richards, R. W. Huigens, T. E. Ballard, A. Basso, J. Cavanagh, C. Melander, Chemical Communications 2008, 14, 1698-1700). Follow up growth curves and colony counts indicated that 6 had no effect on planktonic growth (FIG. 3A, 4A), indicating that inhibition of biofilm development was not due to microbicidal activity. 6 also dispersed pre-formed A. baumanni biofilms with an EC50 of 400 μM (FIG. 2A). The effect of tether length between the 2-AI and triazole on activity was addressed by determining the IC50 of biofilm inhibition for 7 and 8 against A. baumannii. Dose response studies revealed that the IC50 of 7 was 220 μM (FIG. 1A). 8 did not inhibit A. baumannii biofilm development in a significant fashion (<50%) at 800 μM (highest concentration tested, data not shown). Thus, increasing tether length appears to correlate with increased activity. Within the context of the 2-AIT conjugate, we also tested the necessity of the 2-AI subunit by synthesizing compound 9 and assaying for its ability to inhibit A. baumannii biofilm development. 9 was synthesized by alkylating commercially available 1-H-1,2,3-triazole with 5-iodo-pent-1-yne, followed by subjecting the resulting triazole alkyne to the click reaction. Compound 9 revealed minimal activity (<30% inhibition) at the highest concentration studied (800 μM, data not shown). 2-Aminomidazole was also screened and found to be devoid of activity up to 800 μM (highest concentration tested, data not shown). As indicated above, as the number of methlylene units between the 2-AI group and the triazole are increased in the context of 6-8, we see an increase in anti-biofilm activity in the context of A. baumannii. Therefore, we synthesized 2-AIT conjugates 10-12, where we systematically extended the methylene linker to investigate if additional methylenes unit would deliver a 2-AIT conjugate with even greater biological activity than 6. When 10 was assayed for the ability to inhibit A. baumanni biofilm formation, we noted an IC50 value of 2.8 μM. Furthermore, 10 revealed IC50 values of 15 μM, 4.0 μM, and 23 μM against PAO1, PA14, and Rb50 (FIG. 1B and Table 2). We also tested the ability of 10 to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus biofilm development. 10 revealed an IC50 value of 7.0 μM against S. aureus. Colony counts and growth curves of each bacterial strain grown in the presence of 10 revealed that activity was not due to bactericidal activity (FIG. 3B, 4B), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first example of a non-bactericidal small molecule that will inhibit biofilm development across both order and phylum (D. J. Musk, P. J. Hergenrother, Current Medicinal Chemistry 2006, 18, 2163-2177). TABLE 2 Effect of chain length on activity.a n A. baumannii PAO1 PA14 Rb50 S. aureus 4 (10) 2.8 15 4.0 23 7.0 5 (11) 0.98 5.6 0.53 9.5 0.81 6 (12) 6.8 2.7 22 70 4.6 aIC50 values are indicated in μM. Increasing the methylene spacer to 5 carbons (11), again led to an increase in activity. 11 revealed IC50 values of 980 nM, 5.6 μM, 530 nM, 9.5 and 810 nM against A. baurnannii, PAO1, PA14, Rb50, and S. aureus respectively (FIG. 1C). Addition of another methylene group (6 carbons, 12) did not lead to an increase in activity. We observed IC50 values of 6.8 μM,2.7□μM, 22 μM, 70 μM, and 4.6 μM against A. baumannii, PAO1, PA14, Rb50, and S. aureus, respectively (FIG. 1D). Follow up colony count and growth curve analysis revealed that inhibition of biofilm development for both 11 and 12 was not due to microbicidal activity (FIG. 3C, 4C). Finally, we have tested for the ability of a single administration of 2-AIT conjugates 10-12 to disperse pre-formed bacterial biofilms (FIG. 2B, 2C, 2D). The summary of these experiments is outlined in Table 3. As can be seen, each compound was able to disperse the pre-formed biofilm, across bacterial order and phylum.

In conclusion, we have developed a synthetic approach to access 2-aminoimidazole/triazole (2-AIT) conjugates that is underpinned by the Cu(I)-catalyzed [3+2] alkyne/azide cycloaddition. Using this chemistry, we have assembled a focused library of 2-AIT conjugates and, using an initial hit from this library as lead, derived compounds that are able to inhibit and disperse bacterial biofilms across both order and phylum. Mechanistic studies are currently underway to determine how 2-AIT conjugates 10-12 inhibit and disperse biofilms. Furthermore, given the promising anti-biofilm activity displayed by these and other 2-AI derivatives (Melander et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0181923; J. J. Richards, R. W. Huigens, T. E. Ballard, A. Basso, J. Cavanagh, C. Melander, Chemical Communications 2008, 14, 1698-1700; J. J. Richards, T. E. Ballard, C. Melander, Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry 2008, 6, 1356-1363; J. J. Richards, T. E. Ballard, R. W. Huigens, C. Melander, ChemBioChem 2008, 9, 1267-1279; R. W. Huigens, L. Ma, C. Gambino, A.

Melander, Journal of the American Chemical Society 2007, 22, 6966-6967), we are continuing to develop methodology to access further functionalized libraries based upon the 2-AI core motif. Example 2 Protocols for 2-AIT Conjugate Synthesis and Activity Testing All reagents used for chemical synthesis were purchased from commercially available sources and used without further purification. Chromatography was performed using 60 Å mesh standard grade silica gel from Sorbtech (Sorbent Technologies, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.). NMR solvents were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, Mass.) and used as received, 1H NMR (300 MHz or 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (75 MHz or 100 MHz) spectra were recorded at 25° C. on Varian Mercury spectrometers. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane or the respective NMR solvent; coupling constants (J) are in hertz (Hz). Abbreviations used are s=singlet, bs=broad singlet, d=doublet, dd=doublet of doublets, t=triplet, dt=doublet of triplets, bt=broad triplet, qt=quartet, m=multiplet, bm=broad multiplet and br=broad. High and low resolution mass spectra were obtained at the North Carolina State Mass Spectrometry Laboratory for Biotechnology. FAB experiments were carried out with a JOEL HX110HF mass spectrometer while ESI experiments were carried out on an Agilent LC-TOF mass spectrometers. A. baumannii (strain #19606) was obtained from ATCC.

Example 5 Bacterial Biofilm Regulation Studies General Static Bacterial Biofilm Inhibition Assay Procedure for A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, B. bronchiseptica and S. aureus: Biofilm inhibition assays were performed by taking an overnight culture of bacterial strain and subculturing it at an OD600 of 0.01 into the necessary growth liquid medium (LB for A. baumannii, LBNS for P. aeruginosa, Stainer Scholte medium that was supplemented with 10 μL/mL of 100× nutrient complex for B. bronchiseptica and TSBG for S. aureus) for the strain. The compound being tested was then added at a predetermined concentration and then aliquoted (100 μL) into the wells of a 96-well PVC microtiter plate (Wells not used for samples are filled with 100 μL of de-ionized water). Plates were then wrapped in GLAD Press n' Seal® and incubated under stationary conditions at 37° C. After 24 hours, the media was discarded from the wells and the plates were washed thoroughly with tap water. Plates were then stained with 100 μL of 0.1% solution of crystal violet (CV) and then incubated at an ambient temperature for 30 minutes. Sample plates were then washed with tap water again and the remaining stain was solubilized with 200 μL of 95% ethanol. Biofilm inhibition was quantitated by measuring the OD540 for each well by transferring 125 μL of the solubilized CV stain into a polystyrene microtiter dish for analysis. General Static Bacterial Biofilm Dispersion Assay Procedure for A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus: Dispersion assays were performed by taking an overnight culture of bacterial strain and subculturing it at an OD600 of 0.01 into the necessary growth liquid medium. The resulting bacterial suspension was aliquoted (100 μL) into the wells of a 96-well PVC microtiter plate. Plates were then wrapped in GLAD Press n' Seal® followed by an incubation under stationary conditions at an ambient temperature. After 24 hours, the media was discarded from the wells and the plates were washed thoroughly with tap water. Predetermined concentrations of the compound were then made in the same medium used to initially grow the biofilms and then aliquoted (100 μL) into the wells of the 96-well PVC microtiter plate with the established biofilms. Plates were then wrapped in GLAD Press n' Seal© and incubated under stationary conditions at 37° C. After 24 hours, the media was discarded from the wells and the plates were washed thoroughly with tap water. Plates were then stained with 100 μL of 0.1% solution of crystal violet (CV) and then incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Plates were then washed with tap water again and the remaining stain was solubilized with 200 μL of 95% ethanol. Biofilm dispersion was quantitated by measuring the OD540 for each well by transferring 125 μL of the solubilized CV stain into a polystyrene microtiter dish for analysis. General Static Bacterial Biofilm Dispersion Assay Procedure for B. bronchiseptica: This procedure is identical to the general dispersion procedure described above except that initial biofilm formation in the absence of the test compound was carried out at 37° C. General Planktonic Growth Curve Procedure: The bacterial strains are grown in the absence and in the presence of the test compound at the IC50 value starting at an OD600 of 0.01 in culture tubes in an incubator shaker at 37° C. at 200 rpm. The OD600 was recorded at 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 24 hours. General Colony Count Procedure for A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, B. bronchiseptica and S. aeureus: Colony counts were performed by incubating either bacterial strain in the presence and absence of the test compound at 37° C. in culture tubes until the sample with the absence of the test compound reached an OD600 of 0.40 from a starting OD600 of 0.01. This typically took three to four hours. Once the OD600 of approximately 0.40 was observed, 100 μL were taken from each culture tube from which serial dilutions were made. Then, 10 μL were removed from each serial dilution and plated out on a square gridded petri-dish followed by 16 hours of incubation at 37° C. period (48 hours for B. bronchiseptica) to grow countable colonies. Viable bacteria were quantified through employment of the track-dilution method (Jett et al., Bio Techniques. 1997, 23, 648-650).

Example 7 Sythesis of Additional Compounds The following compounds have been synthesized, as detailed below: General Procedure for Click Reactions and Subsequent Boc Deprotection: The terminal alkyne (1.0 equiv.) and the appropriate azide (3.0 equiv.) were dissolved in a 1:1:1 mixture of ethanol, water, and dichloromethane (ca. 3.6 mL per 0.100 g of terminal alkyne). To this solution sodium ascorbate (60 mol %) and Copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (30 mol %) were added while stirring at room temperature. Reaction mixtures were allowed to stir until completion via TLC analysis (12-24 hrs). The solvents were then removed de vacuo in which the resulting residue was dissolved in dichloromethane and purified via silica gel column chromatography (1:40 methanol:dichloromethane to 1:10 methanol:dichloromethane). To remove the Boc protecting group, the resulting product was then dissolved in a 1:4 trifluoroacetic acid: dichloromethane mixture and allowed to stir for 1.5 hours. Upon completion, the reaction mixture was concentrated de vacuo and then left on a high vacuum overnight. Then, methanol supplemented with HCl was added to the product forming the HCl salt of the deprotected product and then concentrated de vacuo.
