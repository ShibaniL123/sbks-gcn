STYRENIC COMPOSITION CONTAINING LONG FIBERS FIELD OF THE INVENTION [601} The present invention relates to compositions comprising Song fibers dispersed in a thermoplastic polymer matrix containing one or more styrenic polymers, moldabie compositions derived from the compositions and molded products prepared based on such compositions. The present invention also relates to methods of preparing the Song fibers dispersed in a thermopiastic polymer matrix containing one or more styrenic polymers, moSdabie compositions and molded products. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [902} Thermoplastic poiymers are utilized to prepare molded parts in a variety of industries, for example automotive, toys, appliances, farm and lawn tractors and implements, medical devices, food service items, electronic equipment components, and the like. Thermopiastic polymers provide significant advantages for molded products, for example lighter weight than some alternative materials, design flexibility, controlled conductivity, and the like. In some applications thermopiastic polymers present challenges, for example higher coefficient of liner expansion (CLTE), lower modulus, lower conductivity and higher britt!eness than alternative materials. Fillers, such as fibers, can be added to improve CLTE, modulus and based on the nature and content of the fibers, conductivity. The backbone of thermoplastic polymers can be modified to add eiastomeric nature or eiastomeric poiymers can be blended with base thermoplastic polymers to reduce the brittleness of molded parts derived from thermoplastic materials, Thermopiastic polymer systems containing styrenic polymers modified with eiastomeric monomers or blended with eiastomeric poiymers are recognized as providing very good properties, such as heat stability, relatively high modulus and good modulus at elevated temperatures, Molded parts prepared from many thermoplastic poiymer systems require relatively thick cross-sections (for example thick walls) to provide the strength and stiffness required for the desired application. One advantage of parts molded from thermoplastic systems is that surfaces of the molded products can be modified to match functional o aesthetic requirements, surface modified parts can be relatively glossy using some polymer systems and processing techniques. For some applications low g!oss is desired. This can present an additional challenge to a parts manufacturer. Polymer systems based on styrenic polymers, especially those modified to add elastomeric properties, have improved stiffness, modulus and modulus at elevated temperatures thereby allowing the use of thinner cross-sections to reach the desired properties. [903} Thermoplastic polymers systems containing styrenic polymers have been modified with fibers as disclosed in, for example, WO 2011/023541 ; WO 2006/090451 ; US 8,030,393 and US 7,135,520 incorporated herein b reference in their entirety. Such systems have not achieved commercial success due to problems with pellet robustness, for example poor adhesion of the po!yrner matirix to the fibers, and poor flow properties making processing of such materials a challenge. Thus despite the desirable properties of styrenic polymer systems, fiber modified systems have not provided all of the desired properties and been processabie. [004} Thus, what is needed is thermoplastic concentrates containing styrenic polymers and fibers which exhibit Improved pellet robustness and flow properties, moidable compositions based on thermoplastic concentrates containing styrenic polymers and fibers having !ow water absorbtion, good retention of modulus at elevated temperatures. It is further desired that such moidable compositions facilitate the preparation of molded parts with thinner cross-sections required to meet use strength requirements and which provides low gloss on grained surfaces. What is needed is a Goncentrate of fibers in a thermoplastic polymer system containing styrenic polymers and moidable compositions derived therefrom having an improved ba!ance of properties, such as high stiffness, good practical ductility, high heat performance and good processability. What are also needed are methods for preparing such concentrates, moldabie compositions and molded parts derived therefrom which are commercially viable.

Preferred long fibers comprise glass or carbon fibers. Preferably, the long fibers have a length of about 3 to about 30 mm. Preferably, the fibers are derived from a woven mat or a fiber bundle. These compositions are useful for introducing the long fibers into base polymer systems wherein the base poiymer systems are moldabie compositions that can be utilized to prepare molded structures for a wide variety of uses. The compositions of long fibers in polymer matrices are commonly referred to as concentrates, that is concentrates of long fibers in the polymer matrices. The base polymer systems can be referred to dilution polymers because contacting of the base polymers with the compositions of long fibers in polymer matrices results in compositions having lower concentrations of long fibers than contained In the concentrate described. (Î˜06} The invention also relates to a moldabie composition comprising a dilution polymer composition comprising one or more thermoplastic polymers having a melt flow rate of 5 or greater and the composition comprising long fibers and a polymeric matrix as described hereinbefore.

Preferably, the moldabie composition contains about 1 percent or less of compounds which compatibles thermoplastic polymers including styrenic based polymers with polyarnides.

[007} In another embodiment, the invention is a method comprising contacting a fiber mat or bundle of fibers with a mixture comprising a polymeric matrix comprising about 10 to about 50 percent by weight based on the polymer matrix of one or more styrenic copolymers containing one or more unsaturated nitrile compound derived monomer units and one or more elastomeric monomer units and about 20 to about 90 percent by weight of one or more polyarnides, wherein the styrenic copolymers exhibit a melt flow rate of about 6 or greater under conditions such that the fiber mat or bundle of fibers is surrounded by the poiymer matrix. In some embodiments the method may further comprise cutting the fiber mat or bundle of fibers having the polymer matrix surrounding the fiber mat or bundie of fibers to a length of about 3 to about 30 mm. in some embodiments, the components of the polymer matrix are blended prior to contacting the polymer matrix with the fiber mat or bundle of fibers. fOOSJ The concentrates of fibers dispersed in polymer matrices of the invention provide improved pellet robustness and flow properties, moldable compositions based on the concentrates of long fibers in polymer matrices exhibit low water absorbiioa, good retention of modulus at elevated temperatures, and facilitates the preparation of molded parts with thinner cross-sections required to meet use strength requirements and which can provide low gloss on grained surfaces. The concentrates and moldable compositions derived therefrom provide an improved balance of properties, such as high stiffness, good practical ductility, high heat performance and good processabi!ity. The methods for preparing such concentrates, moldable compositions and molded parts derived therefrom are commercially viable. The concentrates and moldable compositions can be utilized In a variety of industries, for example automotive, toys, appliances, farm and lawn tractors and implements, medical devices, food service items, electronic devices, and the like. Examples of parts that may be fabricated from the moidable compositions include automobile lift-gates, instrument pane! carriers, front end carriers, door modulus, seat backs, seat pans, radiator fans, interior trim, cases or housings for electronic devices, and the like.

[00251 illustrative Embodiments of the Invention [0026] The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention, but are not intended to limit the scope thereof. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. 1 0271 A fiber bundle comprising continuous fibers having a diameter of about 5 to 20 micron are passed throug a molten bath of the ingredients listed in Table 1 and pelietized to form glass concentrates of 50 to 60 percent by weight. The concentrates are in the form of pellets with fibers of the length of 1 mm. Tabie 1 [00281 ABS is acrylonitriSe-fautadiene-siyrene terpolymers. SAN is a styrene acryionitrile copolymer. AO is an antioxidant, in particular 1RGANOX â„¢ 12076 antioxidant. \M is a functionaSized polyethylene based impact modifier, maieic anhydride grafted polyethylene. SMI is styrene mateic Imide copolymer. PA6 is poiyamide 6 commonly referred to as Nylon 6. The formed peilets are blended in a coffee mil! for 10 seconds and after the test the blended peilets exhibit a volume expressed in mm before and after the test. The resulting volumes after the mil! test are compiled in Table 2. The enhanced pellet robustness is shown for the examples containing > 25% PA in the melt bath. The addition of a functionaSized polyethylene known as impact modifier for PA also shows a positive effect on the pellet robustness. Table 2 J coffee mil! 10s. (cm) > 100 60 45 30 32 [0029] The concentrates of Example 0 to Example 4 are blended with styrenic polymers and test specimens are prepared. The concentrates are diluted to 35 percent glass with acryionitriie-butadiene-styrene (ASS) or styrene acryionitrile (SAN). The test specimens are tested for Charpy Impact using test method ISO 179-1eA, Tensile Modulus and tensile yield using test method ISO 527, HDT 1.8 MPa unannealed using test method ISO 75/A. The spiral f!ow test is performed where the material is injected at 260 Â°C melt in a 60 Â°C fool at a 1800 Iv Pa injection pressure in a 2mm thick cavity. Chemical resistance is determined using test method ISO 22088-3. The rating Poor means a visual impact on the surface quality and OK means no visual impact on surface quality. The results are compiled in Table 3. Table 3 The resuits in table 3 show that the targeted high flow and stiffness is obtained with lowest rubber content in the styrenics phase. For enhanced yieid strength performance an optimal rubber ievei is found to be from about 2 to about 5 percent in the final iend. The results also show the improvement in yield strength and HDT (heat distortion temperature) for the composition containing 10% PA. A further increase is shown for the compositions 17.5% PA and up to 0.5% compatibiliser. A further increase in PA content to 26% wiil provide a further steep increase in heat resistance of the final biend. The influence of the presence of the compatibiliser itseif is demonstrated with the 3 concentrates listed in table 4. Table 4 coffee mil! test (mi) 34 40 40 The results after diiution in SAN are shown in table 5. It is shown that the presence of the compatibiliser up to 1% provides a significant improvement of the yield strength.
