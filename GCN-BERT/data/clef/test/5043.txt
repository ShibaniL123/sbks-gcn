BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present disclosure relates to a therapeutic composition comprising a novel combination of triterpenoids for treating cancers, including drug-resistant cancers. 2. Description of Related Art Edible fungus has long been used as a nutritional aid or health food in Asia, with Ling-Zhi, the Chinese name for one form of mushroom Ganoderma lucidum, being the most popular and oldest mushroom known to have medicinal usages for thousands years. Various active compounds have been isolated from Ganoderma including triterpenoids, polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, polypeptides and phyto-sterols and etc. Among them, triterpenoids are the most important components in Ling-Zhi with significant pharmacological activities such as inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, antitumor, antihypertensive and etc. Triterpenoids are generally known to include various types of ganoderic acids (GAs), ganodermic acids (GMAS), ganoderic alcohols, ganoderic ketones and ganoderic aldehydes and etc. Prior studies have demonstrated that GAs possess cytotoxic and/or anti-proliferative effects against tumor cells. For example, ganoderic acid D (GAD) was found to inhibit the proliferation of HeLa human cervical carcinoma (Yue et al., Mol Cell Proteomics (2008) 7, 949-961); ganoderic acids A and H (GAA and GAH) were demonstrated to suppress growth and invasive behavior of breast cancer cells (Jiang et al., Int J Mol Med (2008) 21, 577-584); ganoderic acid X (GAX) was found to inhibit topoisomerases and induced apoptosis in liver cancer cells (Li et al., Life Sci. (2005) 77, 252-265); and ganoderic acid Me (GAMe) effectively inhibited tumor growth, and lung metastasis (Wang et al., Int Immunopharmacol (2007) 7, 864-870). As to ganodermic acid S (GMAS), it was found to induce aggregation of platelets (Wang et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. (1989) 986, 151-160), inhibit function of platelets (Wang et al., Biochem. J. (1991) 277 (Pt 1), 189-197), as well as the signaling cellular responses induced by thromboxane A2 (Su et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. (1999) 58, 587-595; Su et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. (1999b) 1437, 223-234) or prostaglandin E1 (Su et al., Thromb. Res. (1999c) 99, 135-145) in platelets. Inventors of this application unexpectedly identify that a novel combination of triterpenoids exhibits anti-proliferative effects toward certain tumors, including drug resistant cancers; hence such novel combination of triterpenoids may be used as a medicament or an adjuvant for the treatment or prophylaxis of cancers. SUMMARY The present disclosure is based, at least in part, unexpected discovery that a novel combination of triterpenoids respectively isolated from the fruit bodies or mycelia of Ganoderma lucidum may suppress or inhibit the growth of cancerous cells, including cancers that are drug-resistant.

EXAMPLES Materials and Methods Cell Culture Cell lines used in the present disclosure include human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231, human hepatoma cell line HepG2, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116, human non-small cell lung cancer cell line PC-9, gefitinib-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer cell line PC-9 (PC9-IR), human non-small cell lung cancer cell line H1650, human myeloid leukemia cell line K652, human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 and mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line. MDA-MB-231, HepG2, HCT116 and LLC cell lines were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), whereas PC9, PC9-IR, K562, and HL-60 cell lines were cultured and maintained in RPMI medium and maintained in 5% CO2 at 37° C. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 ng/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, non-essential amino acids and sodium pyruvate. Cells were grown and maintained in Petri dishes (each was 10 cm in diameter) until reached 80% confluence, then were subject to cell passages. Briefly, cells were first washed with phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 3 ml) once, then treated with 0.05% Trypsin/0.025% EDTA solution (1 mL) for 5 min so that the attached cells become suspended. Collected the suspended cells, added 2 mL fresh culture media to neutralize any remaining activity of trypsin. Adjusted the cell density by adding appropriate amounts of culture medium to the cell suspension, which was then used to seed the culture plates. The plates were then returned to the incubator and cultured in accordance with the steps described above. Cell Activity Analysis Cells were seeded in 96-well plates with a density of 3,000 cells/well and cultured in accordance with the procedures described above. On the day when cell activity analysis was to be conducted, cells were first treated with various concentrations of the novel combination of triterpenoids of the present disclosure, imatinib or gefitinib for at least 48 hours, before subjecting them to acid phosphatase (ACP) analysis. Acid Phosphatase Analysis Cell activity may be derived from the acid phosphatase (ACP) activity of a cell. Live cells possess abundant amounts of ACP, which converts its substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) to p-nitrophenol (p-NP) with a maximum adsorption occurs at the wavelength of 405 nm; hence, ACP activity may be used as an indication of cell activity. Cultured cells in each well were washed with PBS (200 ml), then a reacting solution (100 μl) (10 mM p-NPP, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 5.5) was added and allowed to react with the cells for 30-40 min at 37° C. The reaction was subsequently stopped with a basic solution (10 μl, 0.1N NaOH). Adsorption at the wavelength of 405 nm was then measured, and the concentration that inhibited 50% cell activity (IC50) was derived from the absorbance measurement. Primary Tumor Induction and In Vivo Treatment Male C57BL/6 and NOD/SCID mice aged 6 weeks were used in this experiment. Animals were kept at specific pathogen-free conditions under 12:12 light-dark cycle with food (laboratory rodent diet 5001 purchased from PMI Nutrition International Inc. MO, USA) and water (i.e., distilled water) provided ad libitum, ambient temperature and relative humidity were respectively set at 22±3° C. and 50±20%. AH procedures involving animal studies of the present disclosure comply with the “Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” issued by The Chinese-Taipei Society of Laboratory Animal Sciences. The day before tumor inoculation, mice were randomly divided into groups while making sure that the average weight in each group did not differ significantly. The fur on the right hind leg of each animal was then shaved. To inoculate tumor in mice, human lung cancer A549 cells or human colon cancer HCT116 cells (1×107 cancer cells/0.1 mL) were injected subcutaneously to NOD/SCID mice, and mouse LLC lung cancer cells (1×106 cancer cells/0.1 mL) were injected to C57BL/6 mice to generate s.c. tumors on day 1. Treatment with the pharmaceutical composition of this disclosure started 3 days after the tumor inoculation. All treatment solutions respectively containing the pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure were freshly made right before the treatment. Animals were forced fed with the respective treatment solutions twice a day, with 3 hours apart from each feeding. Day 1 was the day when treatment started, and treatments for C57BL/6 and NOD/SCID mice completed on days 22 and 35, respectively. The animals were then sacrificed with tumors being surgically removed. Tumor sizes were measured using calipers and tumor volume was calculated using the formula: volume=width2×length×0.52. Tumor burdens were determined by the total volume of all the tumor nodules.

Results are summarized in Table 3. TABLE 3 Cell Line Human Colon Cancer HCT-116 Human Lung Cancer A549 IC50 15.5 17.2 (μg/mL) Taken together the results from Tables 2 and 3, it appears that composition 2 is at least 3 times more potent than that of composition 1, in terms of inhibition of cancer cell activity. Given the fact that composition 2 comprises at least 4 times of the amount of GMAS as compared with that of composition 1, it is hypothesized that the increased potency of composition 2 may be resulted from the action of increased level of GMAS in the composition. 1.4 Composition 1 of Example 1.1 Inhibits the Gefitinib-resistant Cancer Cells The respective effects of composition 1 of example 1.1 on gefitinib-resistant cancer cell line PC9-IR (PC9-IR) were also investigated in accordance with similar procedures described in the “Material and Methods” section. The doses in which 50% cell activity inhibited by the composition 1 of example 1.1 or gefitinib (IC50), as well as resistant ratio (RR), which determines the susceptibility of the two cell lines to the tested chemicals, are summarized in is Tables 4. RR is an expression of the relative susceptibility of one cell line towards a test compound, by dividing IC50 of one cell line over that of the other. TABLE 4 IC50 Cell Line Gefitinib (μM) Composition 1 (μg/mL) PC-9 0.0371 35.7 PC9-IR 10.6 34.6 Resistant Ratio 284.7 1.0 (PC9-IR/PC9) Respective cell activities of PC-9 and PC9-IR cell lines were suppressed by gefitinib after being treated with gefitinib for 72 hours, with IC50 respectively at 0.0371 mM and 10.6 μM. Composition 1 was also effective in suppressing the cell activity of both cell lines, with similar IC50 at around 35 μM (35.7 vs 34.6 μg/mL). However, when compared with resistant ratio, it is clear that PC-9 cell is more susceptible to gefitinib than the resistant line, PC9-IR; by contrast, the effect of Composition 1 of example 1.1 appears to be the same to both cell lines, in other words, Composition 1 is as effective in killing drug-resistant cells as in the non-drug-resistant cancer cells. 1.5 Composition 1 of Example 1.1 Inhibits Leukemia Cells The respective effects of composition 1 of example 1.1 on leukemia cancer cell lines HL-6-0 and K562 were also investigated in accordance with similar procedures described in the “Material and Methods” section. The doses in which 50% cell activity inhibited by the composition 1 of example 1.1 or imatinib (IC50), as well as resistant ratio (RR), which determines the susceptibility of the two cell lines to the tested chemicals, are summarized in Tables 5. TABLE 5 IC50 Composition 1 Cell Line Imatinib (μM) (μg/mL) HL-60 35.0 25.8 K562 0.4 30.7 Resistant Ratio 86.6 0.84 (HL-60/K562) Respective cell activities of HL-60 and K562 cell lines were suppressed by imatinib after being treated with imatinib for 72 hours, with IC50 respectively at 35 μM and 0.4 μM. Composition 1 was also effective in suppressing the cell activity of both cell lines, with IC50 at 25.8 and 30.7 μg/mL, respectively. However, when compared with resistant ratio, it is clear that K562 cell, instead of HL-60, is more susceptible to imatinib; by contrast, the effect of Composition 1 of example 1.1 appears to be the same to both cell lines, in other words, Composition 1 is as effective in killing both types of leukemia cancer cells. Example 2 Suppression of In Vivo Growth of a Cancer 2.1 Growth Inhibition by the Compositions of Example 1.1 In vivo therapeutic effects of the composition of the present disclosure (i.e., compositions 1 and 3 of example 1.1) were assessed by administering the compositions of this invention to animals having primary tumors, such as lung cancer and colon cancer, that were induced by procedures as described in the “Material and Methods” section. Results are summarized in the following table 6. TABLE 6 Growth Inhibition (%) Mouse Lung Human Lung Human Colon Cancer Cancer A549 Cancer HCT-116 Composition 1 of 80.3 82.5 ND Example 1.1 Composition 3 of ND ND 56.7 Example 1.1 ND = Not determined. As is apparent from Table 6, both compositions of the present disclosure were capable of suppressing the growth of a cancer in vivo, with about 80% of the growth of lung cancer were suppressed by composition 1 of the present disclosure, and about 50% growth inhibition by composition 2 was observed for colon cancer. 2.2 Effects of Triterpenoids on the Growth of Lung Cancer Effects of increased level of triterpenoids on the growth of a cancer were studied in this example, in which the total amounts of triterpenoids in composition 3 of example 1.1 were increased without changing the proportions of respective ganoderic acids and/or ganodermic acids in the composition. Results are summarized in Table 7. TABLE 7 Total Triterpenoids (mg) (%) Growth Inhibition On In Composition 3 of example 1.1 Mouse Lung Cancer 155 61.3 139.5 65.2 108.5 66.4 77.5 47.4 Placebo 18.4 The results are consistent with the findings of the present disclosure that triterpenoids are the therapeutic components of the composition of the present disclosure, for as compared with that of the placebo, which contains negligible amounts of triterpenoids, and exhibits marginal effects on the growth of cancer cells, composition 3 exhibit about 50-65% growth inhibition toward lung cancer. Further, since the level of GMAS in composition 3 is below 2%, hence even though the total triterpenoids in the composition increased, no proportional increased in the suppression of cancer growth was found. Taken together, results of the present disclosure indicate that composition of the present disclosure characterized in having a novel combination of triterpenoids is suitable as medicaments for treating cancers, including the drug-resistant cancers.
