(E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(6-aminopyridin-3-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl -1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(6-aminopyridin-3-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 27b (15 mg, 0.029 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL of ethanol, then 0.15 mL of 1 M lithium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring for 3 hours, the reaction was stopped. 10% citric acid was added dropwise until the pH of the reaction solution was neutral. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(6-aminopyridin-3-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin -1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid 27 (9 mg, yield 62%) as a yellow solid.
