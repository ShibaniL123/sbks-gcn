TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to an organosilicon compound having a hydrolysable silyl group and a catechol structure in the molecule, an adhesive composition comprising the compound, and an article comprising a substrate treated with the composition. BACKGROUND The adhesive protein produced by Mytilus galloprovincialis is a superb underwater adhesive. Recent studies are made on the special chemical structure of this adhesive protein and an adhesion mechanism taking advantage of the chemical structure. Although there is still much to understand about the adhesion mechanism, it is known that a catechol structure compound in the adhesive plays an important role. Patent Document 1 describes to form a polydopamine thin film to improve the adhesion between a plated leadframe and an epoxy resin or silicone resin. Non-Patent Document 1 discloses the synthesis of a silyl-protected catechol-containing silicone by thiol-ene reaction between a silyl-protected vinyl-containing catechol compound and a mercapto-containing silicone and its use in an adhesive composition. In some examples, as described above, catechol structure compounds are used as an ingredient for adhesive compositions. However, there are no known reports referring to an organosilicon compound having a hydrolysable silyl group and a catechol group in the molecule and an adhesive composition containing the same.

To the flask kept at an internal temperature of 75-85°C, 196 g (1 mole) of 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane was added dropwise over 1 hour. The contents were stirred at 80°C for 1 hour, followed by cooling to room temperature. To the reaction mixture, 1,384 g of methanol was added.

TEST OF ADHESION BETWEEN GLASS FIBER AND EPOXY RESIN Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 The silane solutions A to C obtained above and a 1 wt% dilution of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KBE-903, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.) in water and methanol were used as surface treatment agent. Each surface treatment agent was applied to glass fibers having a diameter of 20 µm and dried at 100°C for 30 minutes, yielding surface treated glass fibers. To the surface treated glass fibers, a thermosetting composition composed of an epoxy resin (JER828, Japan Epoxy Resins Co., Ltd.) and triethylenetetramine as curing agent was applied in the form of droplets having a diameter of several tens to several hundreds of microns (µm) such that droplets were kept apart. The droplets were heat cured at 80°C for 1.5 hours and post-cured at 100°C for 2 hours, yielding spherical resin beads. The shear strength between the surface treated glass fiber and the epoxy resin was measured by the microdroplet test using evaluation equipment for interfacial property of composite materials (HM410, Tohei Sangyo Co., Ltd.). The shear strength per unit area (τ, MPa) is determined according to the equation of τ = F/πDL wherein D is the fiber diameter (µm), L is the length (µm) of the fiber portion embedded in the spherical resin bead, and F is the load (mN) required to pull the spherical resin bead out of the fiber in fiber axial direction. The active ingredient of the surface treatment agent is shown in Table 1 together with the results of shear strength.
