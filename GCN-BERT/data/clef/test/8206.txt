FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a method for the production of clofarabine in high yield and without formation of undesired α-N9 stereoisomers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Clofarabine (systematic IUPAC name: 5-(6-amino-2-chloro-purin-9-yl)-4-fluoro-2-(hydroxyl-methyl)oxolan-3-ol) is a purine nucleotide antimetabolite used for the treatment of various types of leukemias, in particular acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Several methods for the production of clofarabine are currently established in the art. The synthesis routes are typically based on a coupling reaction between the purine derivatives and an arabinofuranosyl fragment. Depending on the method of fluorine atom introduction, these synthesis schemes can be divided into two groups: (i) methods in which a fluorine atom is included in a ribofuranose fragment and introduced in the molecule at the coupling step; (ii) methods in which a fluorine atom is introduced after the coupling step by chemical transformations of the nucleoside obtained previously. US Patent 5,034,518 discloses the original synthesis scheme for producing clofarabine developed by Montgomery and coworkers. The synthesis route is illustrated in FIG. 1. In brief, a 1-bromo-2-fluoro-sugar 1 is coupled with 2,6-dichloropurine 2, followed by the amination and deprotection steps. This coupling step results in formation of a mixture of α-and β-anomers of product 3. After chromatographic separation, it is possible to isolate the desired β-anomer with a yield of only 32%. The major disadvantages of this method are in fact the low overall yield of the desired product (13% based on 1), a low stability of starting bromide 1 and a challenging purification of coupling reaction product 3 due to the presence of α-isomer. US Patent 6,949,640 discloses a modification of the above synthesis route involving (i) the use of salts formed by treatment of 2-chloro-6-substituted-purine with strong bases (such as NaH) instead of the NH-forms of purines, and (ii) the use of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-3,5-di-O-benzoyl-α-D-arabinofuranosyl bromide 4 instead of O-acetyl derivative 1 (this synthesis pathway is illustrated in FIG. 2). These modifications made it possible to increase the total yield of clofarabine to about 40% based on compound 4. However, the synthesis scheme is hampered by the low stability of bromide 4, which is difficult to produce, and the formation of mixture of anomers at the coupling stage, requiring challenging column chromatography for the separation of the desired product. The further modification of the method of Montgomery and coworkers is disclosed in US patent 6,680,382 and further illustrated in FIG. 3. This modification involves the use of the potassium salt of 2-chloroadenine 5 obtained by treatment of 2-chloroadenine with t-BuOK instead of the sodium salt of 2,6-dichloropurine, the use of a ternary mixture of solvents (for example, tert-amyl alcohol, CH2Cl2, CH3CN) and addition of CaH2 for the complete removal of water from solvents. The use of low-polarity solvents at the coupling step made it possible to achieve stereoselective proceeding of the reaction (with a ratio of anomer β to α being up to 15:1). In addition, the presence of an amino group in the starting material 2-chloroadenine made it possible to avoid an amination step of the coupling reaction product. As a result, the total yield of purified clofarabine based on fluorinated sugar 4 is about 32%. However, the fluorinated sugar 4 (obtained in four steps from 1-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-β-D-ribofuranose) is difficult to produce and has a low stability, two still existing disadvantages of this method. The method disclosed in US patent publication 2012/0010397 relates to the above-referenced second group of methods for preparing clofarabine. It is illustrated in FIG. 4. 2',3',5'-Tri-O-benzoyl-2-chloroadenosine 8 is obtained at the first step by coupling sugar 6 and TMS-protected 2-chloroadenine 7. The further debenzoylation with hydrazine hydrate results in the formation of a mixture of 3',5'- and 2',5"-di-O-benzoyl derivatives. After isomerization of 2',5'-di-O-benzoyl derivative into the 3',5'-derivative 9, triflate 10 is obtained by treatment of compound 9 with triflic anhydride. Triflate 10, after its fluorination and deprotection, results in the final product clofarabine. However, the disadvantages of this method are the large number of isomers (which are difficult to separate) being formed at the coupling step between 6 and 7 (β-N9, α-N7, β-N7 isomers), the use of highly toxic hydrazine hydrate, the overall yield of purified clofarabine being only 15%. Hence, there is still an ongoing need for improved methods for the synthesis of clofarabine that overcome the limitations of the established synthesis schemes. In particular, there is a need for a synthesis scheme that results in high yield of the product and does not involve the formation of undesired stereoisomers. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide such method for the production of clofarabine. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the production of clofarabine, comprising: (a) preparing 2-chloroadenosine by enzymatic transglycosylation between 2-chloroadenine and a compound of formula 1, wherein, R1 is purine or pyrimidine base of formula 2 or formula 3, respectively, wherein R2 and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of -H, -NH2, -OH, and -CH3; and R4 is selected from the group consisting of -H and -CH3;(b) partially protecting the hydroxyl groups of 2-chloroadenosine to obtain a mixture of a compound of formula 4 and a compound of formula 5, wherein R5 is independently a hydroxyl protecting group;(c) isomerizing the compound of formula 4 to the compound of formula 5;(d) preparing a compound of formula 6 from the compound of formula 5, wherein OR6 is a leaving group;(e) fluorinating the compound of formula 6 to a compound of formula 7; and (f) deprotecting the compound of formula 7 to obtain clofarabine.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the unexpected finding that, when starting from 2-chloroadenosine, the performing of a reaction cascade comprising steps of enzymatic transglycosylation, benzoylation, isomerzation, sulfonate ester formation (i.e. sulfonylation), fluorination and deprotection results in the high yield production of clofarabine without the concomitant formation of undesired stereoisomers, thus avoiding major disadvantages of established methods and providing a more efficient and less laborious synthesis scheme.

These definitions should not be construed to have a scope less than understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art. In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the production of clofarabine, comprising: (a) preparing 2-chloroadenosine by enzymatic transglycosylation between 2-chloroadenine and a compound of formula 1, wherein, R1 is purine or pyrimidine base of formula 2 or formula 3, respectively, wherein R2 and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of -H, -NH2, -OH, and -CH3; and R4 is selected from the group consisting of -H and -CH3;(b) partially protecting the hydroxyl groups of 2-chloroadenosine to obtain a mixture of a compound of formula 4 and a compound of formula 5, wherein R5 is independently a hydroxyl protecting group;(c) isomerizing the compound of formula 4 to the compound of formula 5;(d) preparing a compound of formula 6 from the compound of formula 5, wherein OR6 is a leaving group;(e) fluorinating the compound of formula 6 to a compound of formula 7; and (f) deprotecting the compound of formula 7 to obtain clofarabine. The method according to the present invention is schematically summarized in FIG. 5. In the following, the numbering of the compounds corresponds to the nomenclature used in FIG. 5. 2-Chloroadenosine (III) is obtained by an enzymatic transglycosylation reaction between 2-chloroadenine (II) and any nucleoside which contain ribose, preferably uridine (I) (as it is readily soluble and readily accessible) using enzymes, such as preferably purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and uridine phosphorylase (UP). This reaction is reversible. To shift the equilibrium toward product (III), an excess of uridine of 1.5 to 5 equivalents, preferably 3.3, is used. The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of 40 to 70°C, preferably at a temperature of 58 to 61°C. Due to the stereospecificity of enzymatic transglycosylation, the only product of glycosylation is the β-anomer (III). 2-chloroadenosine may be purified from the starting reagents (I), (II) and uracil (by-product), for example, by using low-pressure preparative chromatography. Typically, conditions allowing 2-chloroadenosine to be retained by the sorbent were chosen, while the vast majority of impurities were not retained on the column. It enabled to simplify the purification process, by comprising only "application" and "washing" steps. The 2-chloroadenosine obtained is then preferably benzoylated with benzoyl chloride in the presence of pyridine. In this reaction, benzoyl chloride may be employed in an amount ranging from 1.8 to 2.5 equivalents, preferably 2.3 equivalents, based on the triol compound of formula (III). The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of -10 to 20°C, preferably at a temperature of 0 to 5°C. As a by-product, up to 35% of 2',3',5'-tri-O-benzoyl-2-chloroadenosine (IV) may be formed. However, presence of this by-product does not interfere with the subsequent isomerization step and may also easily by separated during crystallization of the 3',5'-di-O-benzoyl derivative. Thus, almost the entire amount of the starting compound 2-chloroadenosine finally results in the formation of the 3',5'-di-O-benzoyl derivative. Subsequently, an isomerization of the 2',5'-di-O-benzoyl isomer (V) to the 3',5'-di-O-benzoyl isomer (VI) is performed. The migration of the preferred benzoyl group from the 2' to the 3' position in nucleosides established in the art (cf. inter aliaMaruyama, T. et al. (1999) Chem. Pharm. Bull. 47, 966-970). Preferably, the isomerisation reaction is performed by boiling in methanol for 40-45 hours with vigorous stirring. The resulting crystals obtained after a hot filtration of the reaction mixture have a purity of >98% (HPLC), while almost all impurities remain in the mother liquor, from which 2-chloroadenosine may be isolated after reworking. Subsequent sulfonylation of the compound of formula VI is performed by treatment with Tf2O using pyridine as a base. In this reaction, triflic anhydride may be employed in an amount ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 equivalents, preferably 1.6 equivalents, based on the compound of formula (VI). The solvent may be an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, preferably dichloromethane. The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of -20 to 30°C, preferably at a temperature -10 to 0°C. In the next step, the fluoroderivative (VIII) may be obtained by treatment of the triflate (VII) with fluorinating agents, such as NEt3*3HF, TBAF or TBAF*(t-BuOH)4, preferably NEt3*3HF, for example by using diisopropylethylamine as a base. The solvent may be, for example, ethyl acetate, tetrachloromethane, toluene, acetonitrile, preferably toluene. The reaction may be conducted at a temperature of 0 to 100°C, preferably at a temperature of 35 to 40°C. The protected clofarabine obtained may be crystallized from amixture of ethyl acetate and methanol. Under the above conditions, the yield of the reaction product after crystallization is about 60%. Finally, the protected clofarabine is deprotected under mild conditions. These mild conditions (30 min at 30°C) make it possible to carry out the reaction without any side reactions. Methylbenzoate formed is separated by extraction with methylene chloride, and clofarabine, contained in the aqueous phase, is purified using low-pressure preparative chromatography followed by crystallization. The clofarabine obtained has a high purity without detectable amounts of impurities. The overall yield of clofarabine is about 30-40%. The invention is further described by the figures and the following examples, which are solely for the purpose of illustrating specific embodiments of this invention, and are not to be construed as limiting the claimed subject matter in any way.
