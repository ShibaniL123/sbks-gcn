SUBSTITUTED PYRIDAZINE CARBOXAMIDE COMPOUNDS AS KINASE INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS Related Applications This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/132,505, filed June 19, 2008. The disclosure of the aforementioned patent application is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. Technical Field of the Invention This invention relates to novel pyridazine derivatives, their salts, solvates, hydrates and polymorphs thereof. The invention also provides compositions comprising a compound of this invention and the use of such compositions in methods of treating diseases and conditions associated with protein kinase modulation. Background of the Invention Protein kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues of proteins. Many aspects of cell life (for example, cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, cell cycle and survival) depend on protein kinase activities. Furthermore, abnormal protein kinase activity has been related to a host of disorders such as cancer and inflammation. Therefore, considerable effort has been directed to identifying ways to modulate protein kinase activities. In particular, many attempts have been made to identify small molecules that act as protein kinase inhibitors. The c-Met proto-oncogene encodes the Met receptor tyrosine kinase. The Met receptor is a 190 kDa glycosylated dimeric complex composed of a 50 kDa alpha chain disulfide-linked to a 145 kDa beta chain. The alpha chain is found extracellularly while the beta chain contains transmembrane and cytosolic domains. Met is synthesized as a precursor and is proteolytically cleaved to yield mature alpha and beta subunits. It displays structural similarities to semaphorins and plexins, a ligand-receptor family that is involved in cell-cell interaction. The ligand for Met is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a member of the scatter factor family and has some homology to plasminogen (Longati, Ρ. et al., Curr. Drug Targets 2001, 2, 41-55); Trusolino, L. and Comoglio, Ρ. Nature Rev. Cancer 2002, 2, 289-300]. Met functions in tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis. Expression of Met along with its ligand HGF is transforming, tumorigenic, and metastatic (Jeffers, Μ. et al., Oncogene 1996,13, 853-856; Michieli, Ρ. et al., Oncogene 1999, 18, 5221-5231). MET is overexpressed in a significant percentage of human cancers and is amplified during the transition between primary tumors and metastasis. Numerous studies have correlated the expression of c-MET and/or HGF/SF with the state of disease progression of different types of cancer (including lung, colon, breast, prostate, liver, pancreas, brain, kidney, ovaries, stomach, skin, and bone cancers), Furthermore, the overexpression of c-MET or HGF have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and disease outcome in a number of major human cancers including lung, liver, gastric, and breast. c-MET has also been directly implicated in cancers without a successful treatment regimen such as pancreatic cancer, glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Met mutants exhibiting enhanced kinase activity have been identified in both hereditary and sporadic forms of papillary renal carcinoma (Schmidt, L. et al., Nat. Genet. 1997,16, 68-73; Jeffers, Μ. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1997, 94, 11445-11500). HGF/Met has been shown to inhibit anoikis, suspension-induced programmed cell death (apoptosis), in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells. Anoikis resistance or anchorage-independent survival is a hallmark of oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells (Zeng, Q. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2002, 277, 25203-25208). Increased expression of Met/HGF is seen in many metastatic tumors including colon (Fazekas, Κ. et al., Clin. Exp. Metastasis 2000, 18, 639-649), breast (Elliott, Β. Ε. et al., 2002, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 80, 91-102), prostate (Rnudsen, Β. S. et al., Urology 2002, 60, 1113-1117), lung (Siegfried, J. Μ. et al., Ann. Thorac. Surg. 1998, 66, 1915-1918), and gastric (Amemiya, Η. et al., Oncology 2002, 63, 286-296). HGF-Met signaling has also been associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis (Yamamoto, Υ. et al., J. Hypertens. 2001, 19, 1975-1979; Morishita, R. et al., Endocr. J. 2002, 49, 273-284) and increased fibrosis of the lung (Crestani, Β. et al., Lab. Invest. 2002, 82, 1015-1022). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) superfamily of protein kinases. ALK expression in normal adult human tissues is restricted to endothelial cells, pericytes, and rare neural cells. Oncogenic, constitutively active ALK fusion proteins are expressed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT) due to t2; chromosomal translocations. ALK has also recently been implicated as an oncogene in a small fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and neuroblastomas (Choi et al, Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13); Webb et al, Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 9(3), 331-356, 2009). Anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) are a subtype of the high-grade non-Hodgkin’s family of lymphomas with distinct morphology, immunophenotype, and prognosis. ALCLs are postulated to arise from Τ cells and, in rare cases, can also exhibit a Β cell phenotype. In addition, there are 40% of cases for which the cell of origin remains unknown and that are classified as “null”. First described as a histological entity by Stein et al. based on the expression of CD30 (Ki-1), ALCL presents as a systemic disease afflicting skin, bone, soft tissues, and other organs, with or without the involvement of lymph nodes. ALCL can be subdivided into at least two subtypes, characterized by the presence or absence of chromosomal rearrangements between the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene locus and various fusion partners such as nucleophosmin (ΝΡΜ). Approximately 50-60% of cases of ALCL are associated with the t(2;5;)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation, which generates a hybrid gene consisting of the intracellular domain of the ALK tyrosine kinase receptor juxtaposed with ΝΡΜ. The resulting fusion protein, NPM-ALK has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and has been shown to transform various hematopoietic cell types in vitro and support tumor formation in vivo. Other less frequent ALK fusion partners, e.g., tropomyosin-3 and clathrin heavy chain, have also been identified in ALCL as well as in CD30-negative diffuse large-cell lymphoma. Despite subtle differences in signaling and some biological functions, all fusions appear to be transforming to fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells. ALK fusion proteins have also been detected in a rare form of malignancy called inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Extensive analysis of the leukemogenic potential of NPM-ALK in animal models has further corroborated the importance of NPM-ALK and other ALK rearrangements in the development of ALK-positive ALCL and other diseases. 2-amino-pyridines, such as PF-2341066, have been reported as potent inhibitors of the HGF receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Met) and ALK (J. G. Christensen, et al. Abstract LB-271, AACR 2006 meeting; Η. Υ. Zou et al. Cancer Res 2007; 67: 4408; patent disclosures: WO 2004076412, WO 2006021881, WO 2006021886). PF-234,1066 As there is still unmet need in treatment options for kinase mediated disease, it is desirable to create new and alternative approaches to addressing treatment and prevention of disease, disorders, or symptoms thereof.

Detailed Description of the Invention Definitions It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country. In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention, except where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word “comprise” or variations such as “comprises” or “comprising” is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in various embodiments of the invention. The terms “ameliorate” and “treat” are used interchangeably and both mean decrease, suppress, attenuate, diminish, arrest, or stabilize the development or progression of a disease (e.g., a disease or disorder delineated herein). By “disease” is meant any condition or disorder that damages or interferes with the normal function of a cell, tissue, or organ. By “marker” is meant any alteration that is associated with a disease or disorder. For example, any protein or polynucleotide having an alteration in expression level or activity that is associated with a disease or disorder. In this disclosure, "comprises," "comprising," "containing" and "having" and the like can have the meaning ascribed to them in U.S. Patent law and can mean " includes," "including," and the like; "consisting essentially of or "consists essentially" likewise has the meaning ascribed in U.S. Patent law and the term is open-ended, allowing for the presence of more than that which is recited so long as basic or novel characteristics of that which is recited is not changed by the presence of more than that which is recited, but excludes prior art embodiments. The term “compound” as used herein, is also intended to include salts, prodrugs, and prodrug salts of a compound of formulae herein. The term also includes any solvates, hydrates, and polymorphs of any of the foregoing. The specific recitation of “prodrug,” “prodrug salt,” “solvate,” “hydrate,” or “polymorph” in certain aspects of the invention described in this application shall not be interpreted as an intended omission of these forms in other aspects of the invention where the term “compound” is used without recitation of these other forms. A salt of a compound of this invention is formed between an acid and a basic group of the compound, such as an amino functional group, or a base and an acidic group of the compound, such as a carboxyl functional group. According to another preferred embodiment, the compound is a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “prodrug” means a derivative of a compound that can hydrolyze, oxidize, or otherwise react under biological conditions (in vitro or in vivo) to provide a compound of this invention. Prodrugs may only become active upon such reaction under biological conditions, or they may have activity in their unreacted forms. Examples of prodrugs contemplated in this invention include, but are not limited to, analogs or derivatives of compounds of any one of the formulae disclosed herein that comprise biohydrolyzable moieties such as amides, esters, carbamates, carbonates, and phosphate analogues. Prodrugs can typically be prepared using well-known methods, such as those described by Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery (1995) 172-178, 949-982 (Manfred Ε. Wolff ed., 5th ed); see also Goodman and Gilman’s, The Pharmacological basis of Therapeutics, 8th ed., McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, “Biotransformation of Drugs”. As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “biohydrolyzable moiety” means a functional group (e.g., amide, ester, carbamate, carbonate, or phosphate analogue, that either: 1) does not destroy the biological activity of the compound and confers upon that compound advantageous properties in vivo, such as uptake, duration of action, or onset of action; or 2) is itself biologically inactive but is converted in vivo to a biologically active compound. A prodrug salt is a compound formed between an acid and a basic group of the prodrug, such as an amino functional group, or a base and an acidic group of the prodrug, such as a carboxyl functional group. In a one embodiment, the prodrug salt is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Particularly favored prodrugs and prodrug salts are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a mammal (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or central nervous system) relative to the parent species. Preferred prodrugs include derivatives where a group that enhances aqueous solubility or active transport through the gut membrane is appended to the structure of formulae described herein.

As used herein, the term “polymorph” means solid crystalline forms of a compound or complex thereof which may be characterized by physical means such as, for instance, X-ray powder diffraction patterns or infrared spectroscopy. Different polymorphs of the same compound can exhibit different physical, chemical and/or spectroscopic properties. Different physical properties include, but are not limited to stability (e.g., to heat, light or moisture), compressibility and density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), hygroscopicity, solubility, and dissolution rates (which can affect bioavailability). Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g., differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph) or mechanical characteristics (e.g., tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored polymorph converts to thermodynamically more stable polymorph) or both (e.g., tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). Different physical properties of polymorphs can affect their processing. For example, one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be more difficult to filter or wash free of impurities than another due to, for example, the shape or size distribution of particles of it. The term “substantially free of other stereoisomers” as used herein means less than 25% of other stereoisomers, preferably less than 10% of other stereoisomers, more preferably less than 5% of other stereoisomers and most preferably less than 2% of other stereoisomers, or less than "X"% of other stereoisomers (wherein X is a number between 0 and 100, inclusive) are present.

Combinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of stable compounds. The invention also provides compositions comprising an effective amount of a compound of any of the formulae herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, polymorph or prodrug, if applicable, of said compound; and an acceptable carrier. Preferably, a composition of this invention is formulated for pharmaceutical use (“a pharmaceutical composition”), wherein the carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and, in the case of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, not deleterious to the recipient thereof in amounts typically used in medicaments. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration. In certain embodiments, the compound of the formulae herein is administered transdermally (e.g., using a transdermal patch). Other formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., tablets and sustained release capsules, and in liposomes, and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. See, for example, Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA (17th ed. 1985). Such preparative methods include the step of bringing into association with the molecule to be administered ingredients such as the carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers, liposomes or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. In certain preferred embodiments, the compound is administered orally. Compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, sachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or packed in liposomes and as a bolus, etc. Soft gelatin capsules can be useful for containing such suspensions, which may beneficially increase the rate of compound absorption. A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets optionally may be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. Methods of formulating such slow or controlled release compositions of pharmaceutically active ingredients, such as those herein and other compounds known in the art, are known in the art and described in several issued US Patents, some of which include, but are not limited to, US Patent Nos. 4,369,172; and 4,842,866, and references cited therein. Coatings can be used for delivery of compounds to the intestine (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,638,534, 5,217,720, and 6,569,457, 6,461,631, 6,528,080, 6,800,663, and references cited therein). A useful formulation for the compounds of this invention is the form of enteric pellets of which the enteric layer comprises hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and com starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added. Compositions suitable for topical administration include lozenges comprising the ingredients in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia. Compositions suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and ηοηaqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets. Such injection solutions may be in the form, for example, of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. Topical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches and iontophoretic administration are also included in this invention. Particularly favored derivatives and prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a mammal (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or central nervous system) relative to the parent species. Preferred prodrugs include derivatives where a group that enhances aqueous solubility or active transport through the gut membrane is appended to the structure of formulae described herein.

Medicinal Research Reviews 1981, 1, 189-214. Application of the subject therapeutics may be local, so as to be administered at the site of interest. Various techniques can be used for providing the subject compositions at the site of interest, such as injection, use of catheters, trocars, projectiles, pluronic gel, stents, sustained drug release polymers or other device which provides for internal access. According to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of impregnating an implantable drug release device comprising the step of contacting said drug release device with a compound or composition of this invention. Implantable drug release devices include, but are not limited to, biodegradable polymer capsules or bullets, non-degradable, diffusible polymer capsules and biodegradable polymer wafers. According to another embodiment, the invention provides an implantable medical device coated with a compound or a composition comprising a compound of this invention, such that said compound is therapeutically active. In another embodiment, a composition of the present invention further comprises a second therapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent includes any compound or therapeutic agent known to have or that demonstrates advantageous properties when administered alone or with a compound of any of the formulae herein. Drugs that could be usefully combined with these compounds include other kinase inhibitors and/or other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of the diseases and disorders discussed above. Such agents are described in detail in the art. Preferably, the second therapeutic agent is an agent useful in the treatment or prevention of a disease or condition selected from cancer. Even more preferably the second therapeutic agent co-formulated with a compound of this invention is an agent useful in the treatment of c-met, ron, or ALK and its fusion proteins such as EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK mediated disease/disorders. In another embodiment, the invention provides separate dosage forms of a compound of this invention and a second therapeutic agent that are associated with one another. The term “associated with one another” as used herein means that the separate dosage forms are packaged together or otherwise attached to one another such that it is readily apparent that the separate dosage forms are intended to be sold and administered together (within less than 24 hours of one another, consecutively or simultaneously). In the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, the compound of the present invention is present in an effective amount. As used herein, the term “effective amount” refers to an amount which, when administered in a proper dosing regimen, is sufficient to reduce or ameliorate the severity, duration or progression of the disorder being treated, prevent the advancement of the disorder being treated, cause the regression of the disorder being treated, or enhance or improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect(s) of another therapy. The interrelationship of dosages for animals and humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described in Freireich et al., (1966) Cancer Chemother Rep 50: 219. Body surface area may be approximately determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardley, Ν.Υ., 1970, 537. An effective amount of a compound of this invention can range from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, more preferably 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, more preferably 0.1 mg/kg to about 2.5 mg/kg. Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on the diseases treated, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, the sex, age and general health condition of the patient, excipient usage, the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments such as use of other agents and the judgment of the treating physician. For pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a second therapeutic agent, an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent is between about 20% and 100% of the dosage normally utilized in a monotherapy regime using just that agent. Preferably, an effective amount is between about 70% and 100% of the normal monotherapeutic dose. The normal monotherapeutic dosages of these second therapeutic agents are well known in the art. See, e.g., Wells et al., eds., Pharmacotherapy Handbook, 2nd Edition, Appleton and Lange, Stamford, Conn. (2000); PDR Pharmacopoeia, Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2000, Deluxe Edition, Tarascon Publishing, Loma Linda, Calif. (2000), each of which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference. It is expected that some of the second therapeutic agents referenced above will act synergistically with the compounds of this invention. When this occurs, its will allow the effective dosage of the second therapeutic agent and/or the compound of this invention to be reduced from that required in a monotherapy. This has the advantage of minimizing toxic side effects of either the second therapeutic agent of a compound of this invention, synergistic improvements in efficacy, improved ease of administration or use and/or reduced overall expense of compound preparation or formulation. Methods of Treatment According to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease or disorder or symptom thereof (e.g., those delineated herein) comprising the step of administering to said subject an effective amount of a compound or a composition of this invention. Such diseases are well known in the art and are also disclosed herein. In one aspect, the method of treating involves treatment of a disorder that is mediated by the protein kinase, e.g., c-met, ron. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a disease in a subject comprising administering to the subject a compound of formula I. In another aspect, invention provides a method of treating a disease in a subject comprising administering to the subject a composition comprising a compound of formula I. In certain embodiments, the disease is mediated by the c-met or ron kinases. In another embodiment, the disease is cancer or a proliferation disease. In yet another embodiment, the disease is lung, colon, breast, prostate, liver, pancreas, brain, kidney, ovaries, stomach, skin, and bone cancers, gastric, breast, pancreatic cancer, glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, papillary renal carcinoma, or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In a one embodiment, the method of this invention is used to treat a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disease or condition. Such diseases, disorders or symptoms thereof include, for example, those modulated by a protein kinase (e.g., c-met, ron, ALK and its fusion proteins such as EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK). The disease or disease symptom can be, for example, cancer or proliferation disease or disorder. The disease or disease symptom can be lung, colon, breast, prostate, liver, pancreas, brain, kidney, ovaries, stomach, skin, and bone cancers, gastric, breast, pancreatic cancer, glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, papillary renal carcinoma, or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Methods delineated herein include those wherein the subject is identified as in need of a particular stated treatment. Identifying a subject in need of such treatment can be in the judgment of a subject or a health care professional and can be subjective (e.g. opinion) or objective (e.g. measurable by a test or diagnostic method). In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of modulating the activity of a protein kinase , (e.g. protein tyrosine kinase, kinases listed herein) in a cell comprising contacting a cell with one or more compounds of any of the formulae herein. In another embodiment, the above method of treatment comprises the further step of co-administering to said patient one or more second therapeutic agents. The choice of second therapeutic agent may be made from any second therapeutic agent known to be useful for indications herein. Additional therapeutic agents include but are not limited to agents for treatment of diseases, disorders or symptoms thereof including for example, anticancer agents, antiproliferative agents, antineoplastic agents, antitumor agents, antimetabolite-type/thymidilate synthase inhibitor antineoplastic agents, alkylating-type antineoplastic agents, antibiotic-type antineoplastic agents, or, any other agent typically administered as a primary or adjuvant agent in cancer treatment protocols (e.g., antinausea, antianemia, etc.), including for example, vinblastine sulfate, vincristine, vindesine, vinestramide, vinorelbine, vintriptol, vinzolidine, tamoxifen, toremifen, raloxifene, droloxifene, iodoxyfene, megestrol acetate, anastrozole, letrazole, borazole, exemestane, flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate, goserelin acetate, luprolide, finasteride, herceptin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinoside, doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitomycin-C, dactinomycin, mithramycin, cisplatin, carboplatin, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulphan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, nitrosoureas, thiotephan, vincristine, taxol, taxotere, etoposide, teniposide, amsacrine, irinotecan, topotecan, an epothilone, Iressa, Avastin, OSI-774, angiogenesis inhibitors, EGF inhibitors, ΜΕΚ inhibitors, VEGF inhibitors, CDK inhibitors, Herl and Her2 inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. The term “co-administered” as used herein means that the second therapeutic agent may be administered together with a compound of this invention as part of a single dosage form (such as a composition of this invention comprising a compound of the invention and an second therapeutic agent as described above) or as separate, multiple dosage forms. Alternatively, the additional agent may be administered prior to, consecutively with, or following the administration of a compound of this invention. In such combination therapy treatment, both the compounds of this invention and the second therapeutic agent(s) are administered by conventional methods. The administration of a composition of this invention comprising both a compound of the invention and a second therapeutic agent to a subject does not preclude the separate administration of that same therapeutic agent, any other second therapeutic agent or any compound of this invention to said subject at another time during a course of treatment. Effective amounts of these second therapeutic agents are well known to those skilled in the art and guidance for dosing may be found in patents and published patent applications referenced herein, as well as in Wells et al., eds., Pharmacotherapy Handbook, 2nd Edition, Appleton and Lange, Stamford, Conn. (2000); PDR Pharmacopoeia, Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2000, Deluxe Edition, Tarascon Publishing, Loma Linda, Calif. (2000), and other medical texts. However, it is well within the skilled artisan’s purview to determine the second therapeutic agent’s optimal effective-amount range. In one embodiment of the invention where a second therapeutic agent is administered to a subject, the effective amount of the compound of this invention is less than its effective amount would be where the second therapeutic agent is not administered. In another embodiment, the effective: amount of the second therapeutic agent is less than its effective amount would be where the compound of this invention is not administered. In this way, undesired side effects associated with high doses of either agent may be minimized. Other potential advantages (including without limitation improved dosing regimens and/or reduced drug cost) will be apparent to those of skill in the art. In yet another aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of any of the formulae herein alone or together with one or more of the above-described second therapeutic agents in the manufacture of a medicament, either as a single composition or as separate dosage forms, for treatment or prevention in a subject of a disease, disorder or symptom set forth above. Another aspect of the invention is a compound of the formulae herein for use in the treatment or prevention in a subject of a disease, disorder or symptom thereof delineated herein. In other aspects, the methods herein include those further comprising monitoring subject response to the treatment administrations. Such monitoring may include periodic sampling of subject tissue, fluids, specimens, cells, proteins, chemical markers, genetic materials, etc. as markers or indicators of the treatment regimen. In other methods, the subject is prescreened or identified as in need of such treatment by assessment for a relevant marker or indicator of suitability for such treatment. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of monitoring treatment progress. The method includes the step of determining a level of diagnostic marker (Marker) (e.g., any target or cell type delineated herein modulated by a compound herein) or diagnostic measurement (e.g., screen, assay) in a subject suffering from or susceptible to a disorder or symptoms thereof delineated herein, in which the subject has been administered a therapeutic amount of a compound herein sufficient to treat the disease or symptoms thereof. The level of Marker determined in the method can be compared to known levels of Marker in either healthy normal controls or in other afflicted patients to establish the subject’s disease status. In preferred embodiments, a second level of Marker in the subject is determined at a time point later than the determination of the first level, and the two levels are compared to monitor the course of disease or the efficacy of the therapy. In certain preferred embodiments, a pre-treatment level of Marker in the subject is determined prior to beginning treatment according to this invention; this pre-treatment level of Marker can then be compared to the level of Marker in the subject after the treatment commences, to determine the efficacy of the treatment. In certain method embodiments, a level of Marker or Marker activity in a subject is determined at least once. Comparison of Marker levels, e.g., to another measurement of Marker level obtained previously or subsequently from the same patient, another patient, or a normal subject, may be useful in determining whether therapy according to the invention is having the desired effect, and thereby permitting adjustment of dosage levels as appropriate. Determination of Marker levels may be performed using any suitable sampling/expression assay method known in the art or described herein. Preferably, a tissue or fluid sample is first removed from a subject. Examples of suitable samples include blood, urine, tissue, mouth or cheek cells, and hair samples containing roots. Other suitable samples would be known to the person skilled in the art. Determination of protein levels and/or mRNA levels (e.g., Marker levels) in the sample can be performed using any suitable technique known in the art, including, but not limited to, enzyme immunoassay, ELISA, radiolabelling/assay techniques, blotting/chemiluminescence methods, real-time PCR, and the like. The present invention also provides kits for use to treat diseases, disorders, or symptoms thereof, including those delineated herein. These kits comprise: a) a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of any of the formula herein or a salt thereof; or a prodrug, or a salt of a prodrug thereof; or a hydrate, solvate, or polymorph thereof, wherein said pharmaceutical composition is in a container; and b) instructions describing a method of using the pharmaceutical composition to treat the disease, disorder, or symptoms thereof, including those delineated herein. The container may be any vessel or other sealed or sealable apparatus that can hold said pharmaceutical composition. Examples include bottles, divided or multichambered holders bottles, wherein each division or chamber comprises a single dose of said composition, a divided foil packet wherein each division comprises a single dose of said composition, or a dispenser that dispenses single doses of said composition. The container can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art which is made of a pharmaceutically acceptable material, for example a paper or cardboard box, a glass or plastic bottle or jar, a re-sealable bag (for example, to hold a "refill" of tablets for placement into a different container), or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. The container employed can depend on the exact dosage form involved, for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. It is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example, tablets may be contained in a bottle, which is in turn contained within a box. Preferably, the container is a blister pack. The kit may additionally comprising information and/or instructions for the physician, pharmacist or subject. Such memory aids include numbers printed on each chamber or division containing a dosage that corresponds with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested, or days of the week printed on each chamber or division, or a card which contains the same type of information. The compounds delineated herein can be assessed for their biological activity using protocols known in the art, including for example, those delineated herein.

LC-MS [M+H] + : 453.0. EXAMPLE 30: BIOLOGICAL DATA Biochemical Assays for c-Met and ALK Kinase assays. Assays were performed as described in Fabian et αℓ. (2005) Nature Biotechnology, vol. 23, ρ.329 and in Karaman et αℓ. (2008) Nature Biotechnology, vol. 26, ρ.127. For most assays, kinase-tagged Τ7 phage strains were grown in parallel in 24-well blocks in an Ε. coli host derived from the BL21 strain. Ε. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with Τ7 phage from a frozen stock (multiplicity of infection ~ 0.1) and incubated with shaking at 32 °C until lysis (~90 minutes). The lysates were centrifuged (6,000 χ g) and filtered (0.2 mm) to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific phage binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinases, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in lx binding buffer (20 % SeaBlock, 0.17χ PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 40χ stocks in 100% DMSO and directly diluted into the assay. All reactions were performed in polypropylene 384-well plates in a final volume of 0.04 ml. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour and the affinity beads were washed with wash buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20). The beads were then re-suspended in elution buffer (lx PBS, 0.05 % Tween 20, 0.5 mM non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 minutes. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by qPCR. Most compounds provided IC50 values of <100 ηΜ in the MET assay and some compounds provided IC50 values of <100 ηΜ in the ALK assay. Ron Biochemical Assay The compounds are assayed for biochemical activity essentially according to the following procedure. In a final reaction volume of 25 μΐ, Ron (h) (5-10 mU) is incubated with 8 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 0.2 mM EDTA, 250 μΜ KKSRGDYMTMQIG, 10 mM MgAcetate and [(y-33P-ATP] (specific activity approx. 500 cpm/pmol, concentration as required). The reaction is initiated by the addition of the MgATP mix. After incubation for 40 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 5 μΐ of a 3% phosphoric acid solution. 10 μΐ of the reaction is then spotted onto a Ρ30 filtermat and washed three times for 5 minutes in 75 mM phosphoric acid and once in methanol prior to drying and scintillation counting. c-Met Receptor Phosphorylation Assay Α549 cells are used in this assay. Cells are seeded at a density of 40,000 cells/well in the growth media (RPMI+10% FBS) into 24-well plates and cultured overnight at 37°C for attachment. Cells are exposed to the starvation media (RPMI + 1% BSA). Dilutions of the test compounds are added to the plates and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Cells are then cool down to room temperature for 15 min followed by stimulation with 40ng/ml HGF for 15 minutes. Cells are washed once with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with 1 lOul/well lysis buffer (Cell Signaling #9803 +0.2% protease inhibitor, Sigma PI860) for 1 hour at 4°C. Cell lysates are transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and are spun at lOOOOrpm for 10 min at 4°C and phosphorylated HGFR is quantitated by Human Phospho-HGF R/c-Met ELISA kit (R&D, DYC2480) according to the manufacture’s instructions.
