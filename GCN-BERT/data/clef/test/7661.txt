FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of crystalline Form I of the methanesulfonate salt of dabigatran etexilate. The present invention does not require the isolation of a dabigatran etexilate intermediate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The drug substance used in the commercial drug product formulation of Pradaxa® is the methanesulfonate salt of dabigatran etexilate, which is chemically designated as β-Alanine, N-[[2-[[[4-[[[(hexyloxy)carbonyl]amino]iminomethyl]phenyl]amino]methyl]-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl]carbonyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-, ethyl ester, methanesulfonate salt of Formula I. Dabigatran Etexilate of Formula II is a prodrug of dabigatran of Formula III which is a direct thrombin inhibitor. Dabigatran etexilate is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It may be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents. U.S. Publication No. 2005/0234104 describes processes for the preparation of crystalline Forms I and II of the methanesulfonate salt of dabigatran etexilate. The crystalline Form I of the methanesulfonate salt of dabigatran etexilate is prepared by dissolving dabigatran etexilate in acetone followed by the addition of a solution of methane sulfonate in acetone. PCT Publication No. WO 2012/077136 describes a process for the preparation of crystalline Form I of the methanesulfonate salt of dabigatran etexilate using an ester and alcohol solvent system, and specifically using ethyl acetate and ethanol solvents. Processes for the preparation of dabigatran etexilate and its methanesulfonate salt are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,380 and PCT Publication Nos. WO 2012/027543, WO 2008/059029, WO 2011/110478, and WO 2006/131491. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have developed a process for the preparation of crystalline Form I of a methanesulfonate salt of dabigatran etexilate.

The organic base may be selected from the group comprising ethylamine or diisopropyl ethyl amine. The inorganic base may be selected from the group comprising sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. Preferably, the base is potassium carbonate. The compound of Formula IV is contacted with n-hexyl chloroformate at a temperature of about 10° C. to about 40° C., for example, about 15° C. to about 25° C. The compound of Formula IV is contacted with n-hexyl chloroformate for about 3 hours to about 6 hours, for example, about 4 hours to about 6 hours. The reaction mixture may be subjected to carbon treatment. The reaction mixture may optionally be treated with butylated hydroxytoluene. The solvent may be recovered from the reaction mixture and the reaction mixture used as such for the next step. The present invention does not require the isolation of the dabigatran etexilate intermediate in step a). The reaction mixture obtained in step a) may be treated with methane sulfonic acid in the presence of a solvent selected from the group comprising of ketones, esters, alcohols, or mixtures thereof.
