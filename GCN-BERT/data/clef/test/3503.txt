BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The presence of certain diseases appears to correlate with expression of a mutant allele. For example, amyloidosis can be correlated to certain transthyretin (TTR) mutations. In such cases, it is desirable to selectively silence expression of the mutant allele, while maintaining expression of the wild-type variant. Amyloidosis related to transthyretin (ATTR) involves the depositing of amyloid fibril proteins in various organs and tissues, including the peripheral, autonomic, and central nervous systems. Transthyretin (TTR) is a secreted thyroid hormone-binding protein that binds and transports retinol binding protein, and serum thyroxine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The pathology of ATTR may include many TTR mutations. Symptoms of ATTR often include neuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy. Peripheral neuropathy can begin in the lower extremities, with sensory and motor neuropathy, and can progress to the upper extremities. Autonomic neuropathy can be manifest by gastrointestinal symptoms and orthostatic hypotension. Patients with TTR gene Val-30-Met, the most common mutation, have normal echocardiograms. However, they may have conduction system irregularities and need a pacemaker. The ATTR V30M variant can cause lower extremity weakness, pain, and impaired sensation, as well as autonomic dysfunction. Vitreous and opaque amyloid deposits can be characteristic of ATTR. Survival upon onset of ATTR may be from five to fifteen years. The major treatment for ATTR amyloidosis is liver transplantation, which removes the major source of variant TTR production and replaces it with normal TTR. Liver transplantation slows disease progression and some improvement in autonomic and peripheral neuropathy can occur. There is currently no pharmacological therapy that can undo the formation of TTR amyloid. There is a continuing need for therapeutics for ATTR and other amyloid-related diseases. There is a long-standing need for gene silencing agents that can selectively downregulate a disease-related allele. There is also a need for active agents that can provide efficient and specific knockdown of TTR.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows the single nucleotide polymorph (SNP) that exists at position 284 in the V30M mutation mRNA, as compared to the wild type (WT) TTR mRNA. Conventional siRNAs that are complementary to the WT mRNA can be tiled around position 284. FIG. 2 shows that the conventional siRNAs complementary to the WT mRNA have limited activity in silencing the WT TTR gene, as measured by TTR knockdown in HepG2 cells. Positions 5, 9, 14 and 15, indicated by arrows, appear to be more accessible to silencing than other positions. FIG. 3 shows that conventional siRNAs that are complementary to the V30M mRNA can be tiled around position 284. Four conventional siRNA variations, namely V30M-P5, V30M-P9, V30M-P14, and V30M-P15, were prepared. Also, as shown in FIG. 3, two reporter variants, V30V and V30M, each bearing nucleotide sequence 264 to 304 of human TTR, V30V being without the point mutation at position 284, and V30M containing the point mutation at position 284, were prepared and used in the PSICHECK reporter system in the 3′-UTR region of Luciferase gene. FIG. 4 shows the activity of the four conventional siRNA variations V30M-P5, V30M-P9, V30M-P14, and V30M-P15 measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay against V30V and V30M gene reporter variants. The conventional siRNA variations V30M-P5, V30M-P9, and V30M-P15 were more effective against V30M than V30V. The conventional siRNA variation V30M-P14 was not more effective against V30M than V30V. FIG. 5 shows IC50 analysis for the four conventional siRNA variations V30M-P5, V30M-P9, V30M-P14, and V30M-P15 measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay against V30V and V30M gene reporter variants. The conventional V30M-P15 variant was 5.6 times more effective against V30M than V30V. Thus, the selectivity of the conventional siRNAs against V30M over V30V was no more than 5.6. FIG. 6 shows the structure of UNA oligomers that were effective in silencing V30M TTR, as measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay. Each of the UNA oligomer embodiments, P15U6, P15U7, P15U14, P15U15, and P15U16, contained four UNA monomers. In each UNA oligomer, a first UNA monomer was located at the 5′ end of the first strand, also called the passenger strand. In each UNA oligomer, the second strand, also called the guide strand, formed a duplex region of 19 monomers length with the first strand. Each UNA oligomer had a duplex region of 19 monomers, and a two-monomer overhang at each end. In each UNA oligomer, a second UNA monomer was located at the 3′ end of the first strand, in the 20th position, which is in an overhang portion. In each UNA oligomer, a third UNA monomer was located at the 3′ end of the second strand, in the 20th position, which is in an overhang portion. In the UNA oligomer embodiments, P15U6, P15U7, P15U14, P15U15, and P15U16, a fourth UNA monomer was located in the second strand at positions 6, 7, 14, 15 and 16, respectively, counting from the 5′ end of the second strand. FIG. 7 shows the activity of UNA oligomers P15U6, P15U7, P15U15, and P15U16, measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay against V30V and V30M gene reporter variants, as compared to the conventional siRNA V30M-P15. For each of the UNA oligomer embodiments, P15U6, P15U7, P15U15, and P15U16, the UNA oligomers were more effective against V30M than V30V. Surprisingly, the activity of the UNA oligomer P15U6 was substantially and advantageously superior to the activity of the conventional siRNA V30M-P15, where each is targeted to V30M. Furthermore, FIG. 7 shows the surprising and unexpected result that the selectivity of the UNA oligomers, P15U6, P15U7, P15U15, and P15U16, against V30M over V30V was substantially greater than for the conventional siRNA V30M-P15. In particular, the selectivity of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30M over V30V was 24, meaning that the IC50 of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30M (37.6 pM) was 24 times lower than the IC50 of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30V (919.9 pM). This selectivity was advantageously 4-fold superior to the selectivity of 5.6 shown above in FIG. 5 for the conventional siRNA. FIG. 8 shows the structure of UNA oligomers that were effective in silencing V30M TTR, as measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay. Each of the UNA oligomer embodiments, P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, P16U16, and P16U17, contained four UNA monomers. In each UNA oligomer, a first UNA monomer was located at the 5′ end of the first strand, also called the passenger strand. In each UNA oligomer, the second strand, also called the guide strand, formed a duplex region of 19 monomers length with the first strand. Each UNA oligomer had a duplex region of 19 monomers, and a two-monomer overhang at each end. In each UNA oligomer, a second UNA monomer was located at the 3′ end of the first strand, in the 20th position, which is in an overhang portion. In each UNA oligomer, a third UNA monomer was located at the 3′ end of the second strand, in the 20th position, which is in an overhang portion. In the UNA oligomer embodiments, P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, P16U16, and P16U17, a fourth UNA monomer was located in the second strand at positions 6, 7, 15, 16 and 17, respectively, counting from the 5′ end of the second strand. FIG. 9 shows the activity of UNA oligomers P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, and P16U16, measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay against V30V and V30M gene reporter variants, as compared to the conventional siRNA V30M-P16. For each of the UNA oligomer embodiments, P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, and P16U16, the UNA oligomers were more effective against V30M than V30V. Surprisingly, the activity of each of the UNA oligomers P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, and P16U16, was substantially and advantageously superior to the activity of the conventional siRNA V30M-P16, where each is targeted to V30M. Furthermore, FIG. 9 shows the surprising and unexpected result that the selectivity of the UNA oligomers, P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, and P16U16, against V30M over V30V was substantially greater than for the conventional siRNA V30M-P16. In particular, the selectivity of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30M over V30V was 23, meaning that the IC50 of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30M (92.4 pM) was 23 times lower than the IC50 of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30V (2119 pM). This selectivity was advantageously 4-fold superior to the selectivity of 5.6 shown above in FIG. 5 for the conventional siRNA. FIG. 10: FIG. 10 (left) shows the selectivity of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30M over V30V. The IC50 of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30M (37.6 pM) was 24 times lower than the IC50 of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30V (919.9 pM). This selectivity was advantageously 4-fold superior to the selectivity of 5.6 shown in FIG. 5 above for the conventional siRNA. FIG. 10 (right) shows the surprising and unexpected result that the IC50 of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30M (92.4 pM) was 23 times lower than the IC50 of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30V (2119 pM). This selectivity was advantageously 4-fold superior to the selectivity of 5.6 shown above in FIG. 5 for the conventional siRNA.

UNA Oligomers The UNA oligomers of this invention can be used for inhibiting V30M TTR expression.

The monomers of a UNA oligomer can include UNA monomers and nucleic acid monomers A UNA oligomer can be a duplex structure of from 14 to 29 monomers in length. In some embodiments, the second strand of a UNA oligomer can have at least one UNA monomer in the duplex region. In certain embodiments, a UNA oligomer can have at least one UNA monomer in the second strand at any of positions 6, 7, 15, 16 or 17 from the 5′ end in the duplex region.

In certain embodiments, a UNA oligomer has an IC50 for reducing V30M TTR expression in vitro of less than 20 pM. In further embodiments, a UNA oligomer can have a selectivity ratio in vitro of at least 5. The selectivity ratio is the ratio of the IC50 for reducing V30M TTR expression to the IC50 for reducing wild type TTR expression. The selectivity ratio of a UNA oligomer of this invention can range from 2 to 1000. In certain embodiments, the selectivity ratio of a UNA oligomer is at least 2, or at least 5, or at least 10, or at least 30, or at least 30, or at least 50, or at least 100. In some aspects, a UNA oligomer of this invention can selectively inhibit V30M TTR expression in vivo. In certain aspects, a UNA oligomer of this invention can selectively inhibit V30M TTR expression ex vivo. A UNA oligomer is an active pharmaceutical molecule being a chain composed of monomers, also called an oligomer. The monomers of the oligomer can include UNA monomers and other nucleic acid monomers. The UNA monomers are novel, synthetic molecules that can be attached in a chain to form an oligomer. The nucleic acid monomers can be naturally-occurring nucleotides, modified naturally-occurring nucleotides, or certain non-naturally-occurring nucleotides. A UNA oligomer of this invention is a synthetic, pharmacologically active molecule and can be used in the treatment of a condition or disease. A UNA oligomer of this disclosure can be a double stranded oligomer. Each strand of the double stranded oligomer can be composed of UNA monomers along with a number of nucleic acid monomers for a total length of 19 to 29 monomers. A UNA oligomer of this invention can contain one or more UNA monomers in any strand. The UNA monomers can be in a single strand, or in either strand of a double stranded UNA oligomer, or in both strands of a double stranded UNA oligomer. UNA Monomers UNA monomers are small organic molecules based on a propane-1,2,3-tri-yl-trisoxy structure as shown below: where R1 and R2 are H, and R1 and R2 can be phosphodiester linkages, Base can be a nucleobase, and R3 is a functional group described below. In another view, the UNA monomer main atoms can be drawn in IUPAC notation as follows: where the direction of progress of the oligomer chain is from the 1-end to the 3-end of the propane residue. Examples of a nucleobase include uracil, thymine, cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, adenine, guanine, inosine, and natural and non-natural nucleobase analogues. In general, because the UNA monomers are not nucleotides, they can exhibit at least four forms in an oligomer. First, a UNA monomer can be an internal monomer in an oligomer, where the UNA monomer is flanked by other monomers on both sides. In this form, the UNA monomer can participate in base pairing when the oligomer is a duplex, for example, and there are other monomers with nucleobases in the duplex. Examples of UNA monomer as internal monomers flanked at both the propane-1-yl position and the propane-3-yl position, where R3 is —OH, are shown below. Second, a UNA monomer can be a monomer in an overhang of an oligomer duplex, where the UNA monomer is flanked by other monomers on both sides. In this form, the UNA monomer does not participate in base pairing. Because the UNA monomers are flexible organic structures, unlike nucleotides, the overhang containing a UNA monomer will be a flexible terminator for the oligomer. A UNA monomer can be a terminal monomer in an overhang of an oligomer, where the UNA monomer is attached to only one monomer at either the propane-1-yl position or the propane-3-yl position. In this form, the UNA monomer does not participate in base pairing. Because the UNA monomers are flexible organic structures, unlike nucleotides, the overhang containing a UNA monomer can be a flexible terminator for the oligomer. Examples of a UNA monomer as a terminal monomer attached at the propane-3-yl position are shown below. Because a UNA monomer can be a flexible molecule, a UNA monomer as a terminal monomer can assume widely differing conformations. An example of an energy minimized UNA monomer conformation as a terminal monomer attached at the propane-3-yl position is shown below. Thus, UNA oligomers having a terminal UNA monomer are significantly different in structure from conventional nucleic acid agents, such as siRNAs. For example, siRNAs may require that terminal monomers or overhangs in a duplex be stabilized. In contrast, the conformability of a terminal UNA monomer can provide UNA oligomers with different properties. Among other things, the structure of the UNA monomer allows it to be attached to naturally-occurring nucleotides. A UNA oligomer can be a chain composed of UNA monomers, as well as various nucleotides that may be based on naturally-occurring nucleosides. In some embodiments, the functional group R3 of a UNA monomer can be —OR4, —SR4, —NR42, —NH(C═O)R4, morpholino, morpholin-1-yl, piperazin-1-yl, or 4-alkanoyl-piperazin-1-yl, where R4 is the same or different for each occurrence, and can be H, alkyl, a cholesterol, a lipid molecule, a polyamine, an amino acid, or a polypeptide. The UNA monomers are organic molecules. UNA monomers are not nucleic acid monomers or nucleotides, nor are they naturally-occurring nucleosides or modified naturally-occurring nucleosides. A UNA oligomer of this invention is a synthetic chain molecule. A UNA oligomer of this invention is not a nucleic acid, nor an oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, as shown above, a UNA monomer can be UNA-A (designated Ã), UNA-U (designated Ũ), UNA-C (designated {hacek over (C)}) and UNA-G (designated {hacek over (G)}). Designations that may be used herein include mA, mG, mC, and mU, which refer to the 2′-O-Methyl modified ribonucleotides. Designations that may be used herein include lower case c and u, which refer to the 2′-O-methyl modified ribonucleotides.

Some examples of modified nucleotides are given in Saenger, Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, Springer-Verlag, 1984. Details of UNA Oligomer Structure A UNA oligomer of this invention is a chain molecule. A UNA oligomer can be a duplex pair. Thus, a UNA oligomer can have a first strand of the duplex and a second strand of the duplex, which is complementary to the first strand, although up to three mismatches can occur. A UNA oligomer duplex can have overhangs. Some UNA oligomers are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,314,227, as well as US Patent Publication No. 20110313020 A1. The target of a UNA oligomer can be a target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the target can be any TTR mRNA of a subject. A UNA oligomer can be active for gene silencing in RNA interference. A UNA oligomer may comprise two strands that together provide a duplex. The duplex may be composed of a first strand, which may also be referred to as a passenger strand or sense strand, and a second strand, which may also be referred to as a guide strand or antisense strand. In some aspects, a UNA oligomer of this invention can have any number of phosphorothioate intermonomer linkages in any position in any strand, or in both strands of a duplex structure. In certain embodiments, a UNA oligomer of this invention can have a phosphorothioate intermonomer linkage between the last one or two monomers at either end of any strand. Examples of UNA oligomers of this invention include duplex pairs, which are in general complementary. Thus, for example, SEQ ID NO:1 can represent a first strand of a duplex and SEQ ID NO:2 can represent a second strand of the duplex, which is complementary to the first strand. For example, the symbol “N” in the first strand can represent any nucleotide that is complementary to the monomer in the corresponding position in the second strand. Example UNA oligomers of this disclosure are shown with 2-monomer length overhangs, although overhangs of from 1 to 8 monomers, or longer, can be used. The symbol “X” in a strand or oligomer represents a UNA monomer. Further, when the oligomer terminates in a UNA monomer, the terminal position has a 1-end, according to the positional numbering shown above, instead of a 5′-end as for a nucleotide, or the terminal position has a 3-end, according to the positional numbering shown above, instead of a 3′-end as for a nucleotide. For example, the UNA oligomer SEQ ID NO: 1 1-X·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·X·X-3 3-X·X·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·N·X·X·X·X·X·X·X·N·N-5′ SEQ ID NO:2 has a UNA monomer 1-end on the first strand, a UNA monomer 3-end on the first strand, a UNA monomer 3-end on the second strand, and a nucleotide 5′-end on the second strand. In some embodiments, a UNA oligomer of this invention can have one or more UNA monomers at the 1-end of the first strand, and one or more UNA monomers at the 3-end of the first strand. In further embodiments, a UNA oligomer of this invention can have one or more UNA monomers at the 3-end of the second strand. In certain embodiments, a duplex UNA oligomer of this invention can have one or more UNA monomers at the 1-end of the first strand, one or more UNA monomers at the 3-end of the first strand, and one or more UNA monomers at the 3-end of the second strand. A UNA oligomer of this invention the oligomer may have a first strand and a second strand, each of the strands independently being 19-23 monomers in length. In certain embodiments, a UNA oligomer of this invention may have a first strand that is 19-23 monomers in length.

In certain embodiments, a UNA oligomer of this invention may have a first strand that is 19 monomers in length, and a second strand that is 21 monomers in length. In certain embodiments, a UNA oligomer of this invention may have a first strand that is 20 monomers in length, and a second strand that is 21 monomers in length. In certain embodiments, a UNA oligomer of this invention may have a first strand that is 21 monomers in length, and a second strand that is 21 monomers in length. In certain embodiments, a UNA oligomer of this invention may have a first strand that is 22 monomers in length, and a second strand that is 21 monomers in length. In another aspect, the UNA oligomer may have a blunt end, or may have one or more overhangs. In some embodiments, the first and second strands may be connected with a connecting oligomer in between the strands, and form a duplex region with a connecting loop at one end. In certain embodiments, an overhang can be one or two monomers in length. A UNA oligomer can mediate cleavage of a target nucleic acid in a cell. In some processes, the second strand of the UNA oligomer, at least a portion of which can be complementary to the target nucleic acid, can act as a guide strand that can hybridize to the target nucleic acid. The second strand can be incorporated into an RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). A UNA oligomer of this disclosure may comprise naturally-occurring nucleic acid nucleotides, and modifications thereof that are compatible with gene silencing activity. In some aspects, a UNA oligomer is a double stranded construct molecule that is able to inhibit gene expression. As used herein, the term strand refers to a single, contiguous chain of monomers, the chain having any number of internal monomers and two end monomers, where each end monomer is attached to one internal monomer on one side, and is not attached to a monomer on the other side, so that it ends the chain. The monomers of a UNA oligomer may be attached via phosphodiester linkages, phosphorothioate linkages, gapped linkages, and other variations. In some embodiments, a UNA oligomer can include mismatches in complementarity between the first and second strands. In other embodiments, a UNA oligomer may have 1, or 2, or 3 mismatches. The mismatches may occur at any position in the duplex region. The target of a UNA oligomer can be a target nucleic acid of a target gene. A UNA oligomer may have one or two overhangs outside the duplex region. The overhangs can be an unpaired portion at the end of the first strand or second strand. The lengths of the overhang portions of the first and second strands can be the same or different. A UNA oligomer may have at least one blunt end. A blunt end does not have an overhang portion, and the duplex region at a blunt end terminates at the same position for both the first and second strands. A UNA oligomer can be RISC length, which means that it has a duplex length of less than 25 base pairs.

EXAMPLES Example 1 FIG. 1 shows the single nucleotide polymorph (SNP) that exists at position 284 in the V30M mutation of the human TTR mRNA, as compared to the wild type (WT) TTR mRNA. Conventional siRNAs that are complementary to the WT mRNA were tiled around position 284. FIG. 2 shows that the conventional siRNAs complementary to the WT mRNA have limited activity in silencing the WT TTR gene, as measured by TTR knockdown in HepG2 cells. Positions 5, 9, 14 and 15 appear to be more accessible to silencing than other positions. FIG. 3 shows conventional siRNAs that were complementary to the V30M mRNA were tiled around position 284. Four conventional siRNA variations, namely V30M-P5, V30M-P9, V30M-P14, and V30M-P15, were prepared. Also, as shown in FIG. 3, two gene reporter variants, V30V and V30M, each bearing nucleotide sequence 264 to 304 of human TTR, V30V being without the point mutation at position 284, and V30M containing the point mutation at position 284, were prepared and used in the PSICHECK reporter system in the 3′-UTR region of Luciferase gene. Example 2 FIG. 4 shows the activity of the four conventional siRNA variations V30M-P5, V30M-P9, V30M-P14, and V30M-P15 as measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay against V30V and V30M gene reporter variants. The conventional siRNA variations V30M-P5, V30M-P9, and V30M-P15 were more effective against V30M than V30V. The conventional siRNA variation V30M-P14 was not more effective against V30M than V30V. FIG. 5 shows IC50 analysis for the four conventional siRNA variations V30M-P5, V30M-P9, V30M-P14, and V30M-P15 measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay against V30V and V30M gene reporter variants. The conventional V30M-P15 variant was 5.6 times more effective against V30M than V30V. Thus, the selectivity of the conventional siRNAs against V30M over V30V was no more than 5.6. Example 3 FIG. 6 shows the structure of UNA oligomers that were effective in silencing V30M TTR, as measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay. Each of the UNA oligomer embodiments, P15U6, P15U7, P15U14, P15U15, and P15U16, contained four UNA monomers. In each UNA oligomer, a first UNA monomer was located at the 5′ end of the first strand, also called the passenger strand. In each UNA oligomer, the second strand, also called the guide strand, formed a duplex region of 19 monomers length with the first strand. Each UNA oligomer had a duplex region of 19 monomers, and a two-monomer overhang at each end. In each UNA oligomer, a second UNA monomer was located at the 3′ end of the first strand, in the 20th position, which is in an overhang portion. In each UNA oligomer, a third UNA monomer was located at the 3′ end of the second strand, in the 20th position, which is in an overhang portion. In the UNA oligomer embodiments, P15U6, P15U7, P15U14, P15U15, and P15U16, a fourth UNA monomer was located in the second strand at positions 6, 7, 14, 15 and 16, respectively, counting from the 5′ end of the second strand. Example 4 FIG. 7 shows the activity of UNA oligomers P15U6, P15U7, P15U15, and P15U16, measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay against V30V and V30M gene reporter variants, as compared to the conventional siRNA V30M-P15. For each of the UNA oligomer embodiments, P15U6, P15U7, P15U15, and P15U16, the UNA oligomers were more effective against V30M than V30V. Surprisingly, the activity of the UNA oligomer P15U6 was substantially and advantageously superior to the activity of the conventional siRNA V30M-P15, where each is targeted to V30M. Furthermore, FIG. 7 shows the surprising and unexpected result that the selectivity of the UNA oligomers, P15U6, P15U7, P15U15, and P15U16, against V30M over V30V was substantially greater than for the conventional siRNA V30M-P15. In particular, the selectivity of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30M over V30V was 24, meaning that the IC50 of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30M (37.6 pM) was 24 times lower than the IC50 of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30V (919.9 pM). This selectivity was advantageously 4-fold superior to the selectivity of 5.6 shown by the conventional siRNA. Example 5 FIG. 8 shows the structure of UNA oligomers that were effective in silencing V30M TTR, as measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay. Each of the UNA oligomer embodiments, P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, P16U16, and P16U17, contained four UNA monomers. In each UNA oligomer, a first UNA monomer was located at the 5′ end of the first strand, also called the passenger strand. In each UNA oligomer, the second strand, also called the guide strand, formed a duplex region of 19 monomers length with the first strand. Each UNA oligomer had a duplex region of 19 monomers, and a two-monomer overhang at each end. In each UNA oligomer, a second UNA monomer was located at the 3′ end of the first strand, in the 20th position, which is in an overhang portion. In each UNA oligomer, a third UNA monomer was located at the 3′ end of the second strand, in the 20th position, which is in an overhang portion. In the UNA oligomer embodiments, P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, P16U16, and P16U17, a fourth UNA monomer was located in the second strand at positions 6, 7, 15, 16 and 17, respectively, counting from the 5′ end of the second strand. Example 6 FIG. 9 shows the activity of UNA oligomers P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, and P16U16, measured in the PSICHECK reporter assay against V30V and V30M gene reporter variants, as compared to the conventional siRNA V30M-P16. For each of the UNA oligomer embodiments, P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, and P16U16, the UNA oligomers were more effective against V30M than V30V. Surprisingly, the activity of each of the UNA oligomers P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, and P16U16, was substantially and advantageously superior to the activity of the conventional siRNA V30M-P16, where each is targeted to V30M. Furthermore, FIG. 9 shows the surprising and unexpected result that the selectivity of the UNA oligomers, P16U6, P16U7, P16U15, and P16U16, against V30M over V30V was substantially greater than for the conventional siRNA V30M-P16. In particular, the selectivity of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30M over V30V was 23, meaning that the IC50 of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30M (92.4 pM) was 23 times lower than the IC50 of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30V (2119 pM). This selectivity was advantageously 4-fold superior to the selectivity of 5.6 shown by the conventional siRNA. FIG. 10 (left) shows the selectivity of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30M over V30V. The IC50 of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30M (37.6 pM) was 24 times lower than the IC50 of UNA oligomer P15U6 against V30V (919.9 pM). This selectivity was advantageously 4-fold superior to the selectivity of 5.6 shown by the conventional siRNA. FIG. 10 (right) shows the surprising and unexpected result that the IC50 of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30M (92.4 pM) was 23 times lower than the IC50 of UNA oligomer P16U6 against V30V (2119 pM). This selectivity was advantageously 4-fold superior to the selectivity of 5.6 shown by the conventional siRNA. Example 7 UNA Oligomers Reduce V30M TTR Deposits In Vivo Transgenic mice for human TTR V30M overexpression are used at 6 months age. TTR wild-type and TTR knockout mice are used as controls. Animals are housed in controlled environment, and euthanized with ketamine and medetomidine. For TTR gene silencing, the TTR UNA oligomer, as well as controls, are delivered in liposome formulations. Mice are injected in the tail vein with TTR UNA oligomer (n=6), at a concentration of 1 mg/kg. Untreated age-matched controls are treated with blank formulation. One injection is given per week for 4 weeks, and animals are sacrificed 48 h after last injection. Liver and colon are removed and collected to 10% formalin and frozen. Liver and colon mRNA are isolated using phenol extraction (Invitrogen). Sciatic nerve from V30M mice is dissected from other tissue, and mRNA is extracted with a RNeasy Mini column (Qiagen). cDNA is synthesized with a SuperScript double-stranded cDNA Kit (Invitrogen).

Double immunofluorescence analysis is performed with sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia, and colon from V30M animals that is removed and treated as above. Comparisons are performed with Student T-test or One-way ANOVA. Data are expressed as mean values±standard error (SEM). p-values less than 0.05 are considered significant. Injection of a composition containing one or more UNA oligomers in V30M mice reduces the V30M TTR deposits in sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia, and colon by at least 90% over controls. Injection of a composition containing any one of UNA oligomers P15U6, P15U7, P15U15, or P15U16, or any combination of these UNA oligomers, in V30M mice reduces the V30M TTR deposits in sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia, and colon by at least 90% over controls.
