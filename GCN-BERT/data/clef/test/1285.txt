Step 10: Preparation of tert-butyl (S)-(1-(6-fluoro-3-hydroxyquinoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate
1.98 g (4.99 mmol) of tert-butyl (S)-1-(3-(benzyloxy)-6-fluoroquinoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate prepared in step 9 was dissolved in MeOH (20 mL), to which 200 mg of 10% Pd/C was added, followed by hydrogenation at room temperature for 1 hour under 1 atm H2. The reaction mixture was filtered with celite pad and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained compound was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 3/1-hexane/ethylacetate, 1/1) to give 1.53 g of the target compound tert-butyl (S)-(1-(6-fluoro-3-hydroxyquinoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate as a white solid (4.99 mmol, yield: 100%).
