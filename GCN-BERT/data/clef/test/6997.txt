This invention relates to cryotherapy elements and cryotherapy devices which make a treatment of an affected portion by repeating freezing and thawing the affected portion. Technology of Background [0002] Cryotherapy elements are utilized to necrotize the affected portion by repeating freezing and thawing the affected portion several times, using Joule-Thomson effect etc. This treatment is called a cryotherapy method. [0003] The affected portion freezes with a predetermined spread by freezing and melts by thawing. By repeating this freezing and thawing more than one time (one cycle), for example two or three times, the surefire necrosis is accomplished. The frozen affected portion is in a state of congelation. The size of the congelation is dectated by the type of organ (tissue) and the freezing temperature. When the cycles are repeated more than 2 cycles, the congelation volume tends to become larger at the time of second cycle than at the first cycle. [0004] As to the relations of these freezing and congelation size, the following patent application was already made by the applicant of this application and has been opened to public. Prior art Documents Patent Documents Patent document: JP, 2010*42231, A a Summary of the Invention Problem to be solved by the Invention On the occasion of cryotherapy, enough preparations are repeated beforehand and put up the treatment plans such as time sequence of the freezing and the thawing and the size of the cryotherapy element, depending on the organ and the disease state of the affected portion. The treatment carried out under this treatment plan. During the treatment it is desirable know the freezing state when freezing, that is, the size of the congelation in the freezing state, but it is difficult to perform the visual check the size of the congelation since the affected portion itself is in the inside of the body, such as lungs. Therefore, it is thought a way that the size of the congelation judged from the image obtained by the MRI device and the CT device, performing the treatment concurrently. [0007] In the imaging with MRI device and the CT device, measurements by MRI and CT are conducted in online concurrently performing the cryotherapy. Since the device itself is large, and is combined with the image processing device, it cannot help becoming large scale also on the system. [0008] It is therefore desired that the size of the congelation is measured easily and on line, without using MRI device and CT device. [0009] An object of this invention is to provide a cryotherapy element and a cryotherapy device to be able to respond to such requests. [0010] Another object of this invention is to provide a cryotherapy element and a cryotherapy device which is able to detect easily the size of the congelation by utilizing an ultrasonic wave.

[0016] This invention further discloses a cryotherapy device wherein said ultrasonic device comprises an ultrasonic transducer, means for transmitting an ultrasonic wave to a frozen part of the k affected portion by excitation of said transducer, means for receivig a reflected signal from the transducer that receives a ultrasonic reflected wave from the frozen part of the affected portion, and size detecting means for obtaining a size of the frozen part of the affected portion based on the reflected signal. [0017] This invention further discloses a cryotherapy device wherein said size detecting means obtain a congelation size based on the area of the envelope of the change in the amplitude and the time of the reflected signal. [0018] This invention further discloses a cryotherapy device wherein said size detecting means obtain a congelation size based on the peak value of the amplitude of the reflected signal. [0019] This invention further discloses a cryotherapy device wherein said size detecting means detect a size based on a reflected signal, excluding a reflected signal corresponding to the distance between an installed position of the ultrasonic transducer and the outer sheath portion, received after this reflected signal. [0020] This invention further discloses a cryotherapy device comprising a cryotherapy element comprising a metallic outer sheath whose inside of a tip portion is provided with a material whose ultrasonic wave conduction characteristic is lower than that of the metal of said outer sheath, and a freezing terminal for freezing and thawing inserted in the outer sheath, enabling a treatment of freezing and thawing of an affected portion; an ultrasonic transducer provided on the outer sheath; means for transmitting an ultrasonic wave to a frozen part of the affected portion by excitation of said transducer; means for receiving a reflected signal from the transducer that receives an ultrasonic reflected wave from the frozen part of the affected portion; and size detecting means for obtaining a size of the frozen part of the affected portion based on the reflected signal, which obtains a size or a diameter of a congelation based on an area of an envelope of or a peak value of a reflected signal not through said material identified from a reflected signal through said material by using a time difference.

Mode of Carryign Out the Invention [0025] Figure 17 is a figure of a whole constitution of a cryotherapy device of this invention. The cryotherapy comprises a cryotherapy element 100 and a congelation size detecting device 200. There are two types of cryotherapy element 100. First one is an example that a freezing element (a freezing probe, same as hereinafter) is put in a metallic or plastic cylinder which become an outer shethe and unified with the cylinder. Second one is an example only of the freezing element without using the outer sheath. Here, the cryotherapy element has a function to necrotize an affected portion by that the freezing gas and the thawing gas alternately enter inside and perform freezing and thawing the affected portion of examined body touching to the outer sheath or the freezing element. [0026] The first type is used a lot for the use in stabbing at the examined body from the outside of the body, and there are examples of usage for the second type that the affected portion is made into partially or completely open state by the operation of the examined body and its affected portion stabbed, and that a small hole is made at the examined body as the laparoscopic surgery and it is inserted through the small hole to stab the affected portion. The first type is the example of the use in the case that cannot be watched, and the second type is the example of the use in the state that the stabbed state can be watched to some extent. [0027] Moreover, the first type is safer element for the examined body from the break of the freezing element in use and the leakage of freezing gas and thawing gas to the outside, since it is the example that the freezing element is inserted in the outer sheath and used. Therefore, it may be used even in the state that the stabbed state can be watched to some extent. [0028] A congelation size detecting device 200 is the device to detect the congelation size of the freezing portion of the affected portion of the examined body. As the congelation size detecting device 200, there are one example of the diagnostic imaging device, such as x-ray CT device, MRI device and the ultrasonic diagnostic equipment, and the other example of the ultrasonic device wherein an ultrasonic transducer is provided on the cryotherapy element 100 described later, and the congelation size detecting device is connected to the element, and detects the congelation size. Here, the congelation size includes a congelation diameter, a congelation area, and a congelation volume. [0029] In the former case that the diagnostic imaging device is utilized, the congelation size is in real time detected according to the progress of freezing. For example, in the x-ray CT device, the radiography or the tomography of the affected portion is carried out by irradiating x rays while freezing (including thrawing). The congelation size is obtained from the data of radiography or the tomogram data obtained from this imaging. In MRI device, MRI pictures are taken while freezing, the tomogram data obtained, and from this the congelation size is obtained. In the ultrasonic diagnostic equipment, the ultrasonic wave is irradiated while freezing, the data of radiography or the tomogram data is obtained. The congelation size obtained from this data of radiography or tomogram data. In the above-mentioned imaging (x-ray, MR.I, ultrasonic wave) under freezing, there are a case to take a picture in succession while freezing, and a case to perform discontinuously (intermittently). Moreover, in a case that the congelation size is detected only once while freezing, the above-mentioned imaging is performed only once according to said one timing. However, when the imaging purpose is to watch the progress of the freezing element under freezing and/or to watch the placement relations with other proximity organs, the imaging is continued through freezing. And the data processing of the congelation size detection can be performed when the detection of the congelation size is needed. [0031] In the detection of the congelation size from the data of radiography or tomogram data, there is a way done by the half manual operation (man-machine operation) using the mouse etc. by watching the transparent image or the tomographic image on the display. Alternatively, there is the way to get automatically. For example, the congelation portion automatically detected and the congelation size is detected from the detected congelation portion. The amount of the pixel data in the congelation portion is different from that in the non-congelation portion. The pixel data of the congelation portion have a larger pixel value than the pixel data of the noncongelation portion. Then, the threshold which both can be identified set, and pixel data that belong to the congelation portion are selected. This pixel data group will show the congelation portion. The congeration size can be obtained from this congelation portion. [0032] The congelation size detection methods were explained with examples for obtaining from the data of radiography or tomogram data, but there is a way to detect from the envelope of the reflected wave signal when an ultrasonic wave is utilized. The detection method using this envelope that only the reflected signal from the congelation portion is distinguished, and the congelation size is obtained from the envelope of this distinguished reflected signal. The congelation detection method utilizing the envelope is explained. The congelation size can be provided in the ratio of the energy of ultrasonic transmitting wave and the energy of received ultrasonic reflected wave from the congelation portion. The energy of the ultrasonic wave is decided by the product of wave-form and its time width. The ultrasonic transmitting wave is the trigonometric functions such as a burst wave, a pulse wave, and a sine wave, etc., and its time width and wave-form are understood beforehand. On the other hand, the ultrasonic reflected wave from the congelation portion decided by an organization, a condition (a sick body) and the congelation size of the target treatment portion, but this is obtained by the measurement. [0035] When the energy of the ultrasonic transmitting wave is assumed be Ei, and the energy of the received ultrasonic wave is assumed to be E2, the congelation size S becomes [Numeric Formula 1] S = k{E2/E)) Here, when the transmitting wave is assumed to be Vi(t), its time width assumed to be ti - tj, the received wave is assumed to be V2(t) and its time width is assumed to be tm ~ tn, Ei and E2 become as follows. However, k is the calibration factor which is the value decided by the focus portion (organs such as the chest, kidney, livers, etc.) and the condition, and is usually k = [Numeric Formula 2] E, = [Numeric Formula 3] Ei and E2 mentioned above are envelope functions of the transmitting wave and the received wave mathematically. [0036] The congelation size changes according to the freezing cycle, the thawing cycle, and the progress of the freezing and the progress of the thawing every each cycle. The measurement of the detection of the congelation size is carried out in various timings. (1) If it is requires to obtain only the congelation size as of the last of each freezing cycle, the reflected wave signal is measured just after the end for each freezing cycle, and the congelation size is detected. (2) If it is required to watch the state of the progress of the congelation according to the progress of the freezing for each freezing cycle, the reflected wave signals are measured in the plural timings in each freezing cycle, and the congelation size is detected. For instance, the first congelation size obtained by performing the first emitting of the ultrasonic wave every each cycle and receiving its reflected wave. The second congelation size obtained by performing the second emitting of the ultrasonic wave in the timing that the first reflected wave completely disappeared and receiving reflected wave. If the third is necessary as follows, a similar measurement performed under similar timing, and the congelation size is detected. (3) If it is required to watch a state of the thawing in the thawing cycle, the congelation size is detected in the plural timings in each thawing cycle. Though in the above-mentioned detecting method, the congelation size S is obtained directly, another detecting method corresponding to the example wherein the calculated value So does not accord with the congelation size and the eoefficent k in the numeral formula 1 takes various values, is explained using Figure 18. Beforehand, the relation between the calculated value So and the congelation size D is obtained by assuming the type of organs and the kind of the tumor etc. to be a parameter, using the model of the examined body etc. and is memorized in the data table 300 as a standard data. And the congelation size D corresponding to the calculated value So obtained from the actual examined body is read out from the data table. [00371 The actual congelation size D depends on three parameters of the type a of organs (focus portion such as lungs, kidney and livers), the condition b of the kinds of tumor etc., and the caluculated value So (called a parameter c). There is a meaning that the calculated value So is assumed to he a parameter c, since the actual calculated value So obtained by the measurement accoding to the progress of the congelation may not necessarily accord with the actual congelation size at that time. Of course, for the case that both accord, the parameter c is unnecessary. The reading out of the data in the data table in consideration of the parameter c is explained. In the data table 300, the calculated value data So and the data D (a, b. c) based on the three parameters are memorized correspondingly. For instance, it is assumed the freezing treatment case for a certain organ ai and certain tumor bi. The real calculated value So in a certain timing was (this corresponds to the parameter ci). Then the data table 300 is referred. And at first the data column corresponding to both of the organ ai and the tumor bi is referred, then, from the data column, the congelation size data Di corresponding to the calculated value data Soi, that is the data D(ai, bi, ci), read out. This data D(ai, bj, ci) is specified as the actual congelation size in timing, and is output for the control unit and the display. [0039] Furthermore, also to the actual calculated value S02 in the following timing (this corresponds to the parameter C2), the corresponding congelation size data D2 is read out similarly, that is the data D(ai, bi, C2), and is specified as the actual congelation size in its timing, and is output for the control unit and the display. [0040] As the ultrasonic device which uses the above-mentioned detecting method utilizing the envelope, there are the case by the above-mentioned ultrasonic diagnostic equipment, and the case that the measurement and detection are carried out by installing the ultrasonic transducer on the cryotherapy element 100. The former ultrasonic diagnostic element different style from the cryotherapy element 100, and has the ultrasonic transducer group of multichannel that can be electronically controlled, and, by a channel change, is enable to emit the ultrasonic waves to variou directions. The ultrasonic reflected wave from the each direction is measurd in every each direction, and the measurement by the envelope about the all significant direction is performed. The congelation size is obtained from the results of the measurements by the envelopes about the all significant directions. Ther is also the case wherein the only one channel is used other than the multichannel. In the case that the ultrasonic transducer is installed on the freezing element 100, the ultrasonic ditecting device is connected to this ultrasonic transducer. The congelation size is obtained by detecting the reflected wave from the ultrasonic transducer by the ultrasonic detecting device. In this case, the ultrasonic transducer and the ultrasonic wave detecting device become the congelation size detecting device of Figure 17. In the case wherein the ultrasonic transducer is installed on the freezing element 100, one channel type is basic. Of course, there is also a case of plural channels such as two channels. It is given to the direction characteristic of each channel so that all the congelation portion is covered with all channels, the ultrasonic wave emission and reception of every channel are conducted, the data of the entire congelation portion is obtained, and hence the congelation size S is acquired. [0042] Because the such detection method utilizing the envelope uses a chronological reflected wave signal from the congelation portion, not acquiring it from the data of the tomographic plane, there is an advantage of much less data capacity than the case using a tomographic plane data as for the data quantity to be processed. [0043] Figure 1 and Figure 2 are resolved views of an embodiment of a cryotherapy element wherein an ultrasonic transducer is installed thereon, of this invention. This element comprises a metallic cylinder 1 which becomes an outer seath, a guide needle 2 and a freezing element (a freezing probe) 3 as shown in Figure 1, and an ultrasonic transducer 4. The tip 1A of the cylinder 1 is open. This tip 1A is a portion which abuts on an affected portion. The tip 1A is, for example, a form of sharp blade, and can stab the affected portion. There is also an example that the tip side of the cylinder 1 is made in the shape of a needle. An inside diameter of the cylinder 1 is the size that the guide needle 2 and the freezing probe 3 can be singly inserted therethrough. [0044] The guide needle 2 which has a sharp tip and has a role of the guide of the progress to the affected portion. The probe 3 for congelation is an element performing the freezing and thawing of the affected portion utilizing Joule-Thomson effect. Gas for freezing and gas for thawing such as argon are sent into the probe alternately, and they are exhausted. A sending-exhausting mechanism (not shown) is connected to the probe 3. The ultrasonic transducer 4 has a support member 4A in sissors shape and two oscillation portions 4B and 4C attached to the tip of the support member as shown in Figure 2. The support member 4A having a spring 4D is a holding means for an operator etc. The oscillation portions 4B and 4C have cylindrical pieces 40 and 41 which can be fixed to the outside cylindrical surface of the cylinder 1 so as to place the cylinder between them. The main bodies 42 and 43 of the oscillation element are bonded to the inner surfaces of the cylindrical pieces 40 and 41. [0046] To attach the ultrasonic transducer 4 to the cylinder 1, the operator holds the support member 4A and bends it inward, and makes the cylindrical pieces 40 and 41 abut on the circumference of the cylinder 1, and afterwords releases hands from the support member 4A, and thus the ultrasonic transducer is attached to the cylinder 1 by working of the spring 4D. As a result, the main bodies 42 and 43 of the oscillation element are adhered to the circumference of the cylinder 1. Though the detachable adhesion by the function of the spring 4D was explained, there are examples other than the spring and a case wherein it is installed in fixed form on the circumference of the cylinder 1. [0047] An ultrasonic transmission and receiving device 5 is connected to the main bodies 42 and 43 of the oscillation element of the ultrasonic transducer 4. The ultrasonic transmitting and receiving device 5 comprises means for transmitting signal for ultrasonic wave excitation * oscillation to the main bodies 42 and 43 of the ultrasonic transducer, and means for receiving a reflected signal from the main bodies 42 and 43 of the ultrasonic transducer received the reflected wave. Oscillation pieces 42 and 43 and the ultrasonic wave transmitting and receiving device 5 is connected by leads 44 along scissors portion of the support member 4A. [0048] In the above-mentioned second type freezing element, the ultrasonic transducer is directly installed to the freezing element 3 as shown in Figure 2 and is used. In the following, though it is explained with the case of the first type of the freezing element, it is similar in the second type of the freezing element. Then, it is explained the direction of the cryotherapy element. The guide needle 2 is inserted into the cylinder 1, and the operater etc. applies the cylinder 1 inserted the guide needle 2 to the biological tissue such as skin etc., and/or the cylinder is advanced, and thus the operation of stabbing carried out by stabbing it with guide needle 2. And it is advanced to the affected portion. When it reaches the affected portion, the guide needle 2 pull out from the cylinder 1. Then, the freezing probe 3 is inserted into cylinder 1 in place of the guide needle 2. Since there are some spaces between the cylinder 1 and the freezing probe 3, the physiological saline poured into the space. [0050] After this, the freezing gas is sent to the freezing probe 3, and the freezing (congealing) the portion being bounded on the cylinder 1 and/or the affected portion including its surounding portion surrounding the freezing probe 3 is carried out, and then the thawing of the congelation portion of the affected portion is carried out by sending the thawing gas. This freezing and thawing is repeated at least one cycle, if possible, around 2-4 cycles are repeated. The ultrasonic transducer 4 is utilized for the measurement of the congelation size (including the volume or the size of the diameter). This may be carried out for every freezing, and for even the measurement of only at the time of the freezing of the first cycle. This is convenient when the freezing size after the second cycle is predictable. [0051] Hereinafter, a view of the measurement of the congelation size in the actual cryotherapy is explained by using Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the state that the freezing probe 3 stabbs from the skin 6 and penetrates the affected portion 7. The ultrasonic transducer 4 was already installed on the cylinder 1. [0052] First of all, the freezing treatment of the affected portion 7 is carried out. This treatment is performed by injecting the freezing (congelation) gas (for instance, argon) into the freezing probe 3 through the pipe 8 from the IS outside. The injection of the freezing gas through the pipe 8 is controlled by the gas sending and exhausting machanism (not shown) installed outside. By the freezing treatment, the affected portion 7 surrounding the probe 3 and the cylinder 1 is made in the state of congelation. [0053] The thawing treatment is carried out immediately after the freezing treatment. This thawing treatment is performed by injecting the thawing gas into the freezing probe 3 through the pipe 8, and this thawing gas is contralled by the gas sending and exhausting mechanism (not shown). In addition, both of the freezing gas and the thawing gas are properly sent to the probe 3 from the gas sending and exhausting mechanism (not shown). [0054] Ultrasonic wave is emitted in an appropriate timing from the oscillation pieces 42 and 43 of the oscillation element 4 during the injection of the freezing gas, by the working of the ultrasonic wave transmitting and receiving unit 5. Both timings of continuous and intermittent can be applied. The ultrasonic wave from the oscillation pieces 42 and 43 propagates through the cylinder 1 and is emitted to its outside. There is the biological tissue including the affected portion 7 in the outside, and the reflected wave from the biological tissue including the affected portion 7 is received by the oscillation pieces 42 and 43, Only either is acceptable for the oscillation pieces 42 and 43, but it is advantageous in that the ultrasonic wave can transmit evenly through the cylinder 1 when the ocillation pieces installed facing each other. [0055] The biological tisssue including the affected portion has the congelation portion and the non-congelation portion. The congelation portion has a little attenuation of the ultrasonic wave like water and the attenuation in the non-congelation portion is large since it is a biological tissue. To the emitted ultrasonic wave, since the medium changes at the boundary between the congelation portion and the non-congelation portion, a peculiar reflection is caused on the boundary. This reflected wave is received with the oscillation pieces 42 and 43 and is to he a reflected signal, and is identified from the signal of the other reflected waves in the ultrasonic wave oscillating receiving unit 5. The identified reflected signal from the boundary reflects the congelation size (area or diameter), and so the congelation size (area or diameter) is found by a predetermined conversion. The above is the principle of the measurement and the detection by the ultrasonic wave of this invention. The concrete measurement example explained. Figure 4 shows the schematic relation of the congelation portion the freezing probe 3 and the cylinder 1. The position Pi( treated as a point for easiness) is the setting position of the ultrasonic transducer and the point P2 is the tip position of the cylinder in the affected portion 7, Though the congelation portion and the affected portion may accord with or may not accord with each other, the purpose of this invention is to measure the size of the congelation portion [0057] Figure 5 shows the equivalent circuit of the ultrasonic wave transmission, and the ultrasonic wave propergation is equivalently shown as the transmission line network. Pi is the setting position of the oscillation element as shown in Figure 4 and P2 is the tip position of the cylinder or the freezing probe 3. (Though in the figure it is the tip position of the cylinder, there is a case that the tip of the probe is projected forward from this tip position. In this case, the the projected tip of the probe becomes P3.) Ps often corresponds to the position of the maximum congelation diameter. It can be expressed that in the state that the congelation is not produced, there no resistance element such as ri, r2, ...etc., and as the congelation progresses, the congelation size grows, and the resistance element is generated one after another in nearer side than P2 (Pi side from P2) and in over P2 — 1► P3. [00581 When the burst transmission ultrasonic wave signal transmitted to such the equivalent circuit as shown in Figure the ultrasonic reflected wave signal appears, and, when it is converted the electric signal, it becomes the reflected signal S2. The reflected signal the signal corresponding to the congelation size, and then the congelation size is detected by identifying this. Figure 6 is a figure for explaining the emission of the ultrasonic wave and its reflection. Pi is the setting position of the ultrasonic wave pieces and 43, 10 is the congelation portion, and Qi is the reflected wave. The ultrasonic wave emitted from the position Pi propagates through the cylinder 1. The propagating ultrasonic wave returns as the reflected wave from the cylinder earliest since the cylinder is metal. And the amount of its attenuation is a little. This becomes the first reflected wave. [00591 The ultrasonic wave propagates the congelation portion 10 from the circumference of the cylinder 1, though the attenuation is larger than that of the cylinder since the congelation portion 10 contains ice (and water at the thawing) a lot. And the reflection occures on the boundary with the living body 15 and becomes the reflected wave Q2. On the other hand, the attenuation of the propagation in the living body is larger than that of the congelation portion 10, and the reflected wave Q3 is smaller. It becomes the reflected wave Qi including the reflected waves Q2, Q3 and the reflected wave from the cylinder. When the reflected wave Q2 in this reflected wave is identified, the reflected wave signal of the congelation portion is obtained. For instance, the direct reflected wave from the cylinder itself has a large amplitude, but can be removed from the received wave electrically in consideration of the physical condition, such as the distance of the cylinder and Pi, since it is the reflected wave that comes just after the emission. The reflected wave Q3 can be identified on the time axis, since it is the reflected wave comes back late after the reflected wave from the congelation portion 10, or the appearance of the attenuation wave which becomes small amplitude is watched and removed from the processing object by a method for removing it. [0060] An example of the actual measurement is explained. In Figure 7, an interval ti is of reflected wave signals from the cylinder, and this interval ti is obtained from the distance of point Pi and P3 beforehand. Then, all the reflected signals which exist in the interval 1l are excluded, and the envelope according to the amplitude and the time change for the reflected signals after the time ti is obtained, and then the area V of this envelope is obtained. The area V is a value reflecting the congelation size, and the congelation size is calculated by the predetermined conversion. The interval t‘2 which is from the time TI to the time that the reflected signal becomes zero becomes long if the congelation size is large, and becomes short if it is small. These series of processing, that is the processing from the ultrasonic wave transmission to the congelation size calculation is carried out by the congelation size detecting unit. The details are described later. [0062] Figure 8 shows the case to perform the congelation size measurement at plural time phases over the entire 1 cycle including freezing and thawing. Figure 8(a) is of before freezing, Figure 8(b) to (d) are of freezing, and (e) and (£) are of thawing. Figure 9(a) to (d) show time charts of the ultrasonic wave reflected signals corresponding to Figure 8(b) to (e), and it is the reflected signal corresponding to the congelation size in each time phase, and then the congelation size in each time phase is obtained from them. [0063] The detection of the congelation size in the plural time phses shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 has the advantage of understanding the appearance of the growth of the congelation in the freezing process. [0064] There is a way from which the congelation diameter is obtained by finding an amplitude peak instead of finding the congelation size in Figure 7 - Figure 9. In this case, it is a method wherein the largeness and smallness of the adjoined amplitudes are compared, the large one is assumed to be a peak on the way, and finally remained peak is the largest amplitude. There is a way to find the peak by requesting soxalled envelope by detecting only the amplitude value. The peak detection by this envelope is suitable for the peak detection by the statistical procedure, when it is difficult to clearly request the peak, for instance, when there is no projecting peak and is no enormous discrepancy in the amplitude. There is a ways to obtain the mean value for values more than a certain threshold value thought to be the peak in the envelope, and a way to obtain the standard deviation and then obtain mean value of values more than a predetermined value. [0065] To request the congelation size and congelation diameter actually, besides the way that the detected or calculated values are converted to the congelation size and the congelation diameter according to the conversion formula, there is a way too by requesting the standard value decided according to the congelation size and the diameter, memorizing them in the i°i memory beforehand, and finding the standard value accord to or near to the measured value or the calculated value and then obtaining the correspond congelation size. An embodiment to raise the identification rate of the reflected signal explained with Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12. In this embodiment, the delay is compulsorily given to the ultrasonic wave reflected signal. Figure 10(a) is an example installed a material piece 20 whose ultrasonic wave propcrgation characteristic is worse (late) than a metal of the cylinder in the cylinder 1 towards the tip thereof. The inside of the cylinder is cut cylindrically, and cylindrical material piece 20, for instance, the plastic material is installed in this cut part. Figure 10(b) is an example wherein the plastic material 20 is installed inside without cutting. Figure 11 shows the time chart of the ultrasonic wave reflected signal in the embodiment of Figure 10. Figure 12 shows the example of its detection. Since the reflected signal n from the plastic material has small amplitude compared with the reflected signal m from the part wherein plastic material not installed, the distinction of both becomes possible. The actual profit that, since the time that reaches the peak amplitude value in the reflected signal m corresponds to the minor axis, and the boundary time of the reflected signals m and n corresponds to the major axis of the congelation portion, the minor axis and the major axis of the congelation portion can be obtained by detecting those time. The congelation portion have various forms. There are examples of almost a globe, the shape like a rugby ball, and the shape like a shallot bulb of vegetables, etc. These are influenced by the shape of the focus portion. The focus portion appeared in is influenced by the organs surrounging it. For instance, if it appears adjacent to the blood vessel, the shape is influenced by the existence of the blood vessel, and, for example, even if the original shape globular, it is different in the portion touching the blood vessel from globular. In addition, it is preferable that the center of the freezing probe is accord with the center of the focus portion, but there is a case not to accord with each other. In case not to accord, the long one and the short one are caused in the distance to the boundary in the focus portion when seeing from the frozen probe, the congelation portion becomes the shape that it reflected, too. [0070] Moreover, there is another example influenced by the blood vessel, too. Since warm blood streams down blood vessel, the blood temperature might adversely affect to the congelation in the focus portion that near or touch the blood vessel. In other words, a part of globular state is distorted, for instance. [0071] In such various kinds of cases, a minor axis and a major axis will appear, and Figure 8 and Figure 9 become the effective technologies for detection of such minor axis and major axis. [0072] Figure 13 is a figure of an embodiment of the processing of the congelation size detection unit. This embodiment comprises a ultrasonic wave transmitting and receiving unit 5, memory 22, processing unit 23, and display unit 24. The ultrasonic wave transmitting and receiving unit transmitts ultrasonic wave excitation signal to the ultrasonic transducer and receives the reflected signal detected by the transducer 4. The ultrasonic wave excitation signal is sent out at the time of measurement of the congelation size. This measument time is decided beforehand, for example, in every each time phase (a) - (i) shown in Figure 8. [0073] The memory 22 stores the amplitude and the time of the received reflected signal as a pair. In the memory 22, it is stored that the conversion formula and reference values for the judgement of the congelation size and the diameter. [0074] In the processing unit 23, in every each time phase, the area of the envelope of the peak amplitude values in the plural significant amplitude values stored in the memory 22 is obtained, and, from this area, by utilizing the conversion formula or by comparison with the reference value, the congelation size is obtained. The display unit 24 displays this result. Moreover, in case of the peak detection, in the processing unit 23, the maximum amplitude value is obtained, and, by assuming this as the peak value, the congelation diameter is calculated. Figure 13 shows a circuit diagram for the excitation of the ultrasonic wave oscillation pieces 42 and 43. This circuit is a concrete example of the ultrasonic wave transmitting and receiving unit 5, and comprises a transmitting unit 51, a receving unit 50, and a directional circuit unit 52, and the directional circuit unit 52 switches the transmitting unit 51 and the receiving unit 52. In addition, the cylinder 1 is grounded (E) electrically. This grounding (E) is to perform excitation in the oscillating pieces 40 and 41 in a good balance. [0076] Figure 15 is a schematic view for an explanation of the excitation by the oscillation pieces 42 and 43. By a transormer 53, the oscillation pieces 42 and 43 are united with an excitation source. The oscillation pieces 42 and 43 are connected to the both sides of the secondary coil of the transformer 53, respectively, and the middle point of the secondary coil is connected to the surface of the cylinder and is grounded (E). [0077] Figure 16 is a figure of an embodiment where the detected congelation size is utilized for the freezing gas control positively. A freezing • thawing sequence control unit 25 is a device for setting the freezing time sequence which is decided beforehand, and is corrected by the detected value of the congelation size. That is, the congelation size obtained in the processing unit 23 is checked whether it is a target congelation size planed beforehand, and it is controlled so as to be enlarged if it is small, and to stop freezing at that time and shift to the thawing treatment if it reached the target congelation size. Then the sequence control unit 25 is controlled with the detected value of the processing unit 23, and an actual gas is controlled by the gas control unit 26.
