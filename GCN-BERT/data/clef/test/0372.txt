Latin name of genus and species of the plant claimed: Prunus armeniaca L. CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS None STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT None BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct variety of apricot tree named ‘NJA151’. Our new tree resulted from crossing ‘Harcot’ as the seed parent with ‘Bhart’ apricot tree, as the pollen parent. The new variety differs from seed parent ‘Harcot’ (unpatented) in that the new variety produces fruit with a dark orange ground color in late June, while the seed parent produces fruit with orange ground color in early July. The new variety differs from pollen parent ‘Bhart’ (Unpatented in the US) in that the new variety is more productive, while the pollen parent has cropped inconsistently. The resulting tree was selected when growing in a cultivated area as the 107st tree in the 21th row of Block J at a research farm in Cream Ridge, N.J. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The ‘NJA151’ variety is distinguished from other apricot varieties due to the following unique combination of characteristics: Attractive round fruit that are only slightly compressed.Fruit with an attractive dark orange ground color.Good production of fruit that ripen in early-season.Fruit have above average eating quality with an average of 17% soluble solids. The variety was asexually reproduced at the research farm in Cream Ridge, N.J. Asexual reproduction of this new variety by budding onto ‘Lovell’ peach rootstock (unpatented) shows that the foregoing characteristics are so reproduced. The following detailed description concerns the original tree, ‘NJA151’. The original tree and asexual progeny have been observed growing in a cultivated area at the research farm in Cream Ridge, N.J. Certain characteristics of this variety, such as growth and color, may change with changing environmental conditions (such as, light, temperature, moisture, nutrient availability) or other factors. Color descriptions and other terminology are used in accordance with their ordinary dictionary descriptions, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Color designations are made with reference to The Royal Horticultural Society (R.H.S.) Colour Chart. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS This new variety is illustrated by the accompanying photographic drawings, depicting the apricot tree by the best possible color representation using color photography. The colors of and illustration of this type may vary with lighting and other conditions under which conditions and, therefore, color characteristics of this new variety should be determined with reference to the observations described herein, rather than from these illustrations alone. FIG. 1 is a color photograph taken on Oct. 14, 2011 of a characteristic twig of ‘NJA151’ in late summer bearing typical leaves of the mature and immature foliage. FIG. 2 is a color photograph taken on Jun. 19, 2012 of characteristic mature fruit, stones and fresh kernels of ‘NJA151’. Whole fruit are presented in four positions and transverse and longitudinal sections to illustrate the orange flesh color and pericarp that does not adhere to the stone.
