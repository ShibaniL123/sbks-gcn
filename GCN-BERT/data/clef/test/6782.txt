No. 13/670,803, filed Nov. 7, 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/556,563, filed Nov. 7, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure is directed, at least in part, to a method of producing ceramic layers on magnesium and its alloys, a magnesium implant with a ceramic layer made by the method, and a magnesium implant having a biocompatible ceramic layer substantially free of material which impairs the biocompatibility of said biocompatible ceramic layer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Traditional methods of osteosynthesis and osteotomy used permanent metal implants made of steel or titanium. However, since these durable metal implants represent a foreign body, patients receiving them are potentially at a greater risk of a local inflammation. Moreover, while these implants tend to permanently protect healing bones against mechanical exposure, this stress shielding-effect actually forestalls the stabilization of the bone tissue that needs mechanical loads to obtain and maintain its rigidity. One solution to this problem requires a follow up surgery to remove the permanent metal implants. But such follow up surgeries increase the risk of re-fracture of the healing bones, and/or cause the patients to suffer unnecessary inconveniences, including delayed recovery and incurrence of additional expenses. Alternative implants using metallic magnesium and certain magnesium alloys have been shown to be biodegradable and potentially suitable for medical applications. However, because of the electrochemical activity of magnesium, the corrosion rates of such implants are highly dependent on factors such as implant composition, type of environment or site of implantation, and the surface condition of the implant (treated or untreated). When exposed to air the surface of untreated magnesium implants reacts with oxygen, building up a layer of magnesium hydroxide on the surface, thereby slowing down further chemical reactions. In saline media, such as in the environment of the human organism, untreated magnesium implants initially corrode very rapidly, producing high amounts of hydrogen gas and magnesium hydroxide. Uncontrolled corrosion of magnesium implants can cause premature failure of loaded implants due to stress corrosion cracking and/or due to corrosion fatigue. Moreover, because of the initial high gas release subcutaneous gas cavities might form. Thus, a need exists for magnesium based implants with improved corrosion performance. The initial high gas release and the formation of gas bubbles in vivo can potentially be avoided by application of a coating to the surface of the magnesium implants prior to implantation. The coating would retard the rate of corrosion of the metal implants, thereby stabilizing the rate of gas release due to corrosion of the implants. Several attempts to improve corrosion performance of magnesium have been reported, including coating by anodization in solutions of concentrated alkaline hydroxides, or in solutions of hydrofluoric acid or acid fluoride salts. Anodization of magnesium using base solutions of concentrated alkaline hydroxides is generally provided through the supply of a DC current at a range of 50 volts to 150 volts. A coating is formed on the magnesium through the formation of sparks within the bath. The tracking of the sparks across the surface of the magnesium element slowly places the coating onto the magnesium. The use of sparks throughout the process leads to a relatively high current usage and to significant heat absorption by the bath itself. Therefore, cooling may be necessary to reduce the temperature of the bath during the anodization process. Use of hydrofluoric acid or acid fluoride salts in anodization of magnesium results in the formation of a protective layer of magnesium fluoride on the magnesium surface. This protective layer is not soluble in water and thus prevents further reaction of the magnesium metal. Other methods for anodization of magnesium or alloys of magnesium incorporate other species into the film as it is formed on the surface of the magnesium. Some anodization processes use silicates and others use various ceramic materials. However, many of the reported magnesium coatings might be toxic. Therefore, a need exists for biocompatible coating compositions and coating processes will produce resorbable biomaterial onto the surface of magnesium implants that cannot completely prevent the degradation process, so the performance of the implants can be modulated by how the implant is coated and/or the corrosion characteristic of the base material used to coat the implants.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present subject matter will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Figures and Examples, in which representative embodiments are shown. The present subject matter can, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided to describe and enable one of skill in the art. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the subject matter pertains. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. During the degradation of metallic magnesium implant, hydrogen gas and magnesium hydroxide are formed by the corrosion reaction. If the amount of released gas surpasses the absorption and diffusion capacity of the surrounding tissue, gas bubbles might form and are often visible on X-rays. The bare metal surface causes an initial increased release of gas right after implantation, but soon after the metal surface is covered with degradation products, the gas release rate stabilizes and might be low enough to allow sufficient gas transport. The application of a coating could avoid the initial high gas release and the formation of gas bubbles. Also, an adequate coating should effectively avoid premature failure of loaded implants due to stress corrosion cracking and/or corrosion fatigue. Moreover, a coating should be biocompatible and be obtainable without the use of toxic or potentially harmful substances. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention provides a method of producing ceramic layers on magnesium and its alloys.

In an embodiment, a method of the present invention provides for forming a ceramic coating on selected portions of the surface area of the implant. In an embodiment, selected portions of the surface area of the implant are electrically insulated to allow selective anodization of the regions of the surface of the implant that are not electrically insulated. In an embodiment, the electric insulation of the areas which are not to be coated is achieved by applying a lacquer, film or foil or the like to the desired regions of the surface area of the implant, and subsequent to the coating process, the applied lacquer, film or foil is removed (by manual delamination, for example). It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that a wide variety of coating patterns may be designed and applied to implants. Those of ordinary skill in the art that would also know that the position and dimensions of the selectively coated regions of the surface area of the implant may be varied to modulate the corrosion performance the coated implant. For example, the selectively coated regions of the implant would be expected to degrade at a slower rate than the uncoated regions because the coat the reactants must first penetrate the coat or erode it before reaching the coated surface of the reactive surface of the implant.

The magnesium implant with a ceramic layer made by the methods of the present invention advantageously has a ceramic layer that not only improves bone tissue adhesion, but also is substantially free of substances which impair the biocompatibility. In an embodiment, the biocompatible ceramic layer is substantially free of material which impairs the biocompatibility of said biocompatible ceramic layer.

US 2003/0004515 A1 and US 2008/0009872 A1, which are each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These and other aspects of the present invention will be further appreciated upon consideration of the following Examples, which are intended to illustrate certain particular embodiments of the invention but are not intended to limit its scope, as defined by the claims. Example 1 Lean Electrolyte Compositions Coatings were made on rectangular magnesium plates with 10 cm2 surface area immersed in selected electrolyte compositions, using a direct current of 0.16 A, a maximum tension of 400 V and a coating time of 10 minutes. The electrolyte compositions used are as follows: Composition of electrolyte A: 0.13 mol/L diammonium hydrogen phosphate, 1.07 mol/L ammoniac (25%), and 0.50 mol/L urea. Composition of electrolyte B: 0.05 mol/L diammonium hydrogen phosphate, 5.36 mol/L ammoniac (25%), and 0.50 mol/L urea. FIG. 1 shows an SEM image of a coating on a magnesium plate with coarse pores produced using electrolyte A, after plastic deformation. FIG. 2 shows an SEM image of a coating on a magnesium plate with fine pores produced using electrolyte B, after plastic deformation. The composition of the electrolyte was the major parameter for the pore size as all other parameters were identical between the two samples. The size and distribution of the pores may be important for the failure behavior of the implant. After plastic deformation and elastic tensioning, the sample with the coarse pores (FIG. 1) shows broader cracks than the sample with fine pores (FIG. 2) where the cracks are finer and more evenly distributed. It is presumed that corrosion attack may be more localized with the coarser pores, which might also act as stress risers. Example 2 In Vivo Degradation Experiment: All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Swiss animal protection law. Fourteen skeletally mature miniature pigs each with an age of 30 to 36 months and an average weight of 53±7 kg were used in this preliminary study. The midface of the miniature pig is approached by a T-type incision where as a median cut of 11-12 cm length was started about 2 cm below the lower orbits. After exposing the frontal bone, a soft tissue pocket was created with a rasp, big enough to accommodate the two rectangular plates and deep enough to profit of the straight portion of the nasal bone. Pre-bending of the plates could therefore be avoided. FIG. 3 illustrates the positioning of implanted plates 10a and 10b on a pig skull 12 in accordance with this Example. Each miniature pig received either two coated or two non-coated magnesium plates. The coated plates were coated in accordance with Example 3 below. In addition to the post-operative X-rays of the head, intermediate radiographs (Philips BVPulsera) were taken at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. FIG. 7 shows an X-ray image of a non-coated magnesium plate implanted in a miniature pig after 1 week. FIG. 8 shows an X-ray image of a coated magnesium plate implanted in a miniature pig at 12 weeks before euthanasia. The animals were sacrificed after 12 and 24 weeks. After euthanasia, a computed X-ray tomography (CT) was made. A medial incision of about 10 cm length was made along the longitudinal axis of the nose and the implants were removed. The pH of the implant bed was determined using pH sensitive strip (Merck 1.09557.0003, pH range 6.4-8.0) which was moistened with distilled water before use. The removed plates were stored in 70% ethanol in a tightly sealed glass bottle. After transportation to the mechanical testing site, the magnesium plates were removed from the glass bottles, dabbed with paper towel and dried in air. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were carried out in a Zeiss EV060 scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a THERMO Scientific ultra dry EDX detector. The measured spectra were analyzed for the elements C, O, Mg, P, Ca, Y, Zr, Nd, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb, Na and K. Chlorine (Cl) was excluded from the analysis as it could not be detected on any of the spectra. Three areas of about 100 μm×100 μm were measured on each sample to determine the EDX-spectra. The weight loss was determined after brushing off the degradation products with a nail brush. Additionally, the plates were immersed in 40% hydrofluoric acid for at least 5 minutes as described by A. Krause et al. (“Degradation behavior and mechanical properties of magnesium implants in rabbit tibiae” Journal of Materials Science 2010, 45, 624-632, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), cleaned in distilled water and ethanol and dried with an air blower. Results: The occurrence of gas bubbles might be taken as an indicator for the in vivo degradation. As the exposed surface of the magnesium plates is very large (2×9 cm2), a daily release of about 5 ml might be expected when using the in vitro gas release rate of 0.3 ml/cm2 per day. If this amount of gas could not be transported away, gas bubbles would form in the thick soft tissue on top of the plates. Intermediate X-rays were used to check the occurrence of gas bubbles and the integrity of the rectangular plates. For the non-coated plates, gas bubbles could be observed in most of the animals after 1 week. The large observed gas bubble in the case of one animal disappeared by week 4. For the coated plates, the occurrence of gas bubbles was delayed. First signs of gas pockets often occurred around the thread holes and started to appear by week 4. No signs of loose tissue could be seen around the titanium control plates. The additional CT images show the situation after euthanasia and before the removal of the plates. The plates did not seem to be much corroded upon removal. The plates removed at 24 weeks showed larger areas with white corrosion products than the plates at 12 weeks. The two sides of the plates were not equally corroded; the top side in contact with the soft tissue seemed more corroded than the bottom side in contact with the frontal bone. The plates seemed well integrated to the surrounding tissue as a lateral step seemed to have formed in the bone. On one animal of each 24 week group, the pH of the implant beds was determined after removal of the plate. No difference in pH could be found for the coated and non-coated groups compared to the titanium reference. pH values of 7.0-7.2 were typically found. The white, enamel-like degradation products seemed more compact and more adherent compared to the in vitro situation. As a consequence, the brushing off of the degradation products was not sufficient and additional bathing in hydrofluoric acid was used to determine the total weight loss. For both kind of plates, the average weight loss was about 5-6% after 12 weeks and increased to 13-14% after 24 weeks. The results of the EDX analysis of the in vivo degradation products prior to the brush off showed significantly higher calcium and phosphor contents for the coated magnesium plates for each milligram of corroded metal and are summarized in Table I below.

Implants from the same lot were used for all experiments (lot MI0018B, T5 heat treated, 6.4×19 mm extrusion profile). The rectangular plates with 60 mm×6.0 mm×1.50 mm were machined dry (w/o lubricant) using hard metal tools. All edges were rounded with a radius of 0.5 mm. A total of 36 plates were tested, half of the plates without a coating and the other half with a plasmaelectrolytic coating from AHC (Kerpen, Germany). A standard MAGOXID™ electrolyte was used and a direct current of 1.4 A/dm2 for up to 400 V was applied to generate the coating. Non-coated plates initially weighted 940±5 mg. The MAGOXID™ coating had a typical thickness of 10 μm and accounted for 15 mg of additional mass. The total surface of a plate was 9 cm2. The plates were cleaned with ultrasound assistance in 90-100% ethanol, dried in air, packaged in pairs of two in a double vacuum pouch and γ-sterilized with a dose of 25-30 kGy. Example 4 In Vitro Immersion Testing Experiment: Coated and non-coated samples were each tested inside a separate immersion unit containing 250 ml of simulated body fluid (SBF). Coated samples were prepared in accordance with Example 3 above. An immersion unit consisted of a graduated glass cylinder with 25 mm inner diameter and 240 mm length and a 250 ml plastic bottle. Each magnesium sample was put inside the glass cylinder which was then filled with SBF. The plastic bottle was put upside down over the glass cylinder. The cylinder/bottle assembly was quickly tilted to avoid the flowing out of the liquid and the remaining SBF was poured into the gap between bottle and glass cylinder. Finally, the lid of the bottle—which had a 33 mm hole—was slid over the glass cylinder to fix the assembly. The bottles were put inside a tempered water bath at 37° C. The simulated body fluid was prepared from stock solutions as described by L. Müller and F. A. Müller [“Preparation of SBF with different HCO3-content and its influence on the composition of biomimetic apatites” Acta Biomaterialia 2 (2006) 181-9, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety] with TRIS buffer and the recipe for a HCO3-content of 27 mmol/L. The addition of NaN3 was omitted as no bacterial growth was observed and as N2 release into the medium could be avoided. The medium was changed once a week. Identical material lots, coatings and geometries were used for the in vitro and the in vivo degradation tests. The samples were immersed for 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The gas release was determined by regular visual inspection of the graded glass cylinders with a precision of about ±1 ml. The average mass loss was determined at the end of the immersion period by brushing off the corrosion products with a common nail brush. Results: The average gas release during immersion in SBF can be seen in FIG. 5, which shows a graph depicting the average gas release rate of coated and non-coated rectangular plates immersed in SBF for up to 12 weeks (average of 6 tests per data point). The non-coated samples started to release gas directly after immersion. Initial gas release rates were highest during the first couple of days (>1 ml/cm2 per day) and then stabilized around 0.3 ml/cm2 per day. On the other hand, the coated samples showed nearly no gas release during the first two weeks. The gas release rates then started to increase and stabilized around 0.2 ml/cm2 per day. The degradation of non-coated magnesium samples was uniform over the entire immersion time. Some localized corrosion seemed to occur for the coated magnesium samples at 12 weeks which might be associated with a slight increase in the gas release rate around day 65 (9-10 weeks). The mass loss of the samples—determined by brushing off the powder-like white corrosion products—could be put into relation with the observed gas release as shown in FIG. 6, which is a graph depicting gas release as a function of weight loss of coated and non-coated plates immersed in SBF for up to 12 weeks (average of 6 tests per data point). For the non-coated samples, about 1 ml of gas is released for 1 mg of corroded magnesium as theoretically expected from the overall corrosion reaction. For the coated magnesium, however, less gas was released than expected; only around 0.6 ml of gas could be collected Example 5 Mechanical Testing Experiment: The 3-point-bending tests of the in vivo and in vitro degraded samples from Examples 2 and 4 were made using a small Zwick/Roell universal testing machine (type BZ2.5/TN1S) with a test device according to ISO EN 178. FIG. 4 illustrates a depiction of the 3-point-bending test showing a sample 20 positioned on two support brackets 22a and 22b being bent by a downward moving plunger 24. A span of 40 mm was used for all the plates. The support brackets had a radius of 2 mm. The plunger was 4 mm in diameter and was moved downwards at a rate of 1 mm/min. The test was stopped after 10 mm of displacement. Forces were recorded with a precision of ±0.5% (2 kN force gauge). Results: The measured maximum bending force, bending stress, yield strength and flexural modulus are given in Table II for the non-coated and in Table III for the coated implants below. Each value averages 6 samples, from individual bottles for the in vitro case and from 3 different animals in the in vivo case (pairs of two). FIG. 9 is a graph further showing the decrease of yield strength over time for in vitro and in vivo degraded coated and non-coated rectangular plates.

In addition to those 3-point-bending tests on in vivo and in vitro degraded plates, the chosen 3-point-bending setup with a constant span of 40 mm was verified with a series of rectangular plates to check if the changed dimensions of the degraded plates would give correct strength measurements. A uniform degradation was “simulated” by decreasing the thickness and width of the plates in 0.2 mm steps down to a thickness of 0.5 mm and to a width of 5.0 mm. According to theory, the bending force F is expected to depend on the thickness d and on the width b as follows: F = 2 3  σ b L  bd 2 , with the span L and the bending stress σb When assuming a constant bending stress, σb=MPa, an excellent fit between the measured maximum forces (results not shown) and the theoretical values was obtained (ΔF≦2 N). This relation might be used to calculate the core thickness of a degraded plate and to assess the uniformity of degradation. Example 6 Anodic Oxidation Experiment: The magnesium implant of WE43 alloy used in this experiment had a surface of 0.1 dm2. It was degreased, pickled and rinsed with aseptic water. The WE43 alloy was treated with an aqueous electrolyte bath consisting of: 1.07 mol/L ammoniac (25%) (80 ml/L);0.13 mol/L diammonium hydrogen phosphate; and0.5 mol/L urea. The magnesium implant was hung into the aqueous electrolyte bath and the positive pole was connected to a D.C. current source. A sheet of stainless steel was also put inside the aqueous electrolyte bath and was connected to the negative pole of the D.C. current source. The current density was set to 1.4 A/dm2. The “ceramization” of the magnesium implant was carried out for 8 minutes. The final voltage was set to 360 V. Results: The obtained ceramic layer had a thickness of 11 μm. The “ceramized” magnesium implant was taken out of the electrolyte bath and was rinsed well with aseptic, de-ionised water and subsequently dried. Chemical analysis of the produced ceramic layer on the WE43-magnesium implant showed MgO, Mg(OH)2 and small amounts of Mg3(PO4)2, Yttrium oxide and oxides of rare earth elements. Other magnesium wrought alloys such as WE54, ZK40, ZK, 60, AZ31 as well as magnesium cast alloys such as AZ91, AM50, AS41 can similarly be ceramized (with stainless steel and platinum as cathode materials, for example) with the procedure of Example 6. Example 7 In Vitro Degradation Behavior of WE43 Samples Experiment: In vitro degradation behavior of non-coated and coated WE43 magnesium alloy samples during immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) is shown FIG. 10. Magnesium WE43 samples with coatings from three different electrolytes exhibit a significantly reduced hydrogen release compared to non-coated WE43 alloy samples. The three electrolytes contained the following: Electrolyte 1: diammonium hydrogen phosphate and ammoniac.Electrolyte 2: diammonium hydrogen phosphate, ammoniac, and urea.Electrolyte 3: citric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and ammoniac. Example 8 Gas Release and Strength Retention of Tensioned WE43 Samples Immersed in SBF Experiment: Rectangular samples of WE43 alloy (60 mm×8.0 mm×0.50 mm) were dry machined (w/o lubricant) using hard metal tools. A portion of the samples were coated with a plasmaelectrolytic coating from AHC (Kerpen, Germany). The electrolyte compositions used for the plasmaelectrolytic coating are variations of the standard MAGOXID™ electrolyte. A direct current of 1.4 A/dm2 for up to 400 V was applied to generate the coating. Other sample lots were coated using different lean electrolytes comprising varying percentages of diammonium hydrogen phosphate, ammoniac (at 25 vol. % concentration), and urea, the ratios of which are shown in Table IV below. The rectangular samples were manually deformed by bending the ends around a cylinder with a 16 mm diameter. The amount of bending is defined by the span of the two ends of the rectangular sample in a relaxed state. A span of about 42 mm was applied to the samples as shown in FIG. 14A, which depicts an example of a manually deformed sample 30. The bent samples were then put under tension by inserting each of the ends of a sample into slots spaced about 12 mm apart in a UHMWPE sample holder. FIG. 14B shows example sample 30 after the ends of which have been inserted into slots 34a and 34b of sample holder 32 under tension. Immersion tests of the tensioned were performed by placing tensioned samples inside separate immersion units containing 250 ml of SBF in a manner similar to the process described in Example 4 for a total of six weeks. The 250 ml of SBF was exchanged once a week. Gas levels were recorded twice on working days and occurrence of failure was visually checked for the samples. Strength retention tests were also carried out on immersed samples using sample holders with screw fixation (FIG. 15A-15D). During the weekly SBF changes, the screw of the holder is loosened and the spring force above the holder is measured by a push pin (indicated by the arrow in FIG. 15A). The samples did not need to be removed from the holder during the procedure. The samples were left in the SBF for 6 weeks irrespective of eventual failure (breakage) of the sample (e.g., shown in FIGS. 15C and 15D). Results: All the tested coatings had an excellent adherence to the base material and did not delaminate during the large plastic deformation applied to the samples. Plastic deformation did introduce microcracks into the coating which broadened during the additional tensioning and allowed greater access to the corrosive SBF medium. Despite the severe testing conditions, the gas release rates of the lean electrolyte-coated samples were found to be between about 0.2 ml/cm2 per day and about 0.4 ml/cm2 per day, and were generally below the values for the non-coated base material which ranged from about 0.4 ml/cm2 per day to about 0.6 ml/cm2 per day. The average accumulated gas release of the lean electrolyte-coated rectangular samples under tension and immersed in SBF over time is shown in the graph of FIG. 11. The strength retention measurements of the lean electrolyte-coated samples is shown in FIG. 12, which is a graph depicting remaining bending force as a function of immersion time. The failure times of tensioned rectangles during immersion in SBF are shown in the box plot of FIG. 13, which illustrates differences between the various coatings. Four of the five non-coated samples failed after 32 days of immersion. The specimens coated with the lean electrolytes showed a larger degree of variance with some samples withstanding the 42 days of immersion without failing while others failed prior to the non-coated samples. The strength retention (remaining bending force) testing, which was applied only to the coated samples, may have accelerated the failure of the coated samples compared to the non-coated samples. Moreover, variations in the manual force applied to bend and tension the samples may have contributed to the wider scatter of results. Additional time to failure and gas release rate data for the lean electrolyte-coated samples are provided in Table IV below.
