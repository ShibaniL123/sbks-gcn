Example 4
2-methoxy-5-(N,N-dimethyl-formamido)-3-pyrrylformonitrile (VII) (1.9 g, 10 mmol), bromocyclopentane (3.0 g, 20 mmol), cesium carbonate (6.5 g, 20 mmol) and N,N-dimethylformamide 25 mL were added in a reaction bottle, were heated to a temperature of 70-80 step by step, and were subjected to stirring reaction for 26-30 hours to finish TLC detection reaction. Cooling was performed, 50 mL of ethyl acetate and 50 mL of water were added, and a water phase was separated out, and then was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. Organic phases were merged, were washed with water and a saturated salt solution successively, were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and then were concentrated, obtained grease was recrystallized with ethyl acetate and n-hexane (2:1), and was dried under vacuum to obtain off-white solid N-cyclopentyl-2-methoxy-5-(N,N-dimethyl-formamido)-3-pyrrylformonitrile (II) 1.85 g, and the yield was 70.9%; and EI-MS m/z: 262[M+H]+,
