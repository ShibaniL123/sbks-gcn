Example 95A
Methyl 6-bromo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylate
In an atmosphere of argon, a mixture of 100.0 g (292.3 mmol) of the compound from Example 3A and 339.0 g (2.85 mol) of thionyl chloride was heated at the boil for 2.5 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was allowed to stand overnight and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up in 200 ml of dichloromethane, and 400 ml (9.87 mol) of methanol were slowly (initially dropwise) added at RT. After 2 h of stirring at RT, the mixture was concentrated and the residue was taken up in 1 l of dichloromethane. 500 ml of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution were added and the mixture was then stirred at RT for 4 min. The phases were subsequently separated and the aqueous phase was extracted once with 250 ml of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was taken up in 150 ml of dichloromethane, diluted with 150 ml of cyclohexane and purified by column chromatography (15 kg of silica gel, dichloromethane/cyclohexane 1:1, then dichloromethane). This gave 86.68 g (83% of theory, 100% purity) of a first batch of the title compound and 5.50 g (5% of theory, 97% purity) of a second batch of the title compound
