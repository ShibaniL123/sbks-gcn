As illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the disposable diaper 10 according to the present embodiment includes a front waistline region 20, a crotch region 25, and a back waistline region 30. Further, a pair of leg hole opening units 35 is formed in the disposable diaper 10. Here, the front waistline region 20 is the portion that is in contact with the front waistline portion of the wearer, the back waistline region 30 is the portion that is in contact with a back waistline portion of the wearer, and the crotch region 25 is the portion that positioned between the front waistline region 20 and the back waistline region 30. In the present embodiment, the direction from the front waistline region 20 towards the back waistline region 30 is called the product longitudinal direction L, and the direction perpendicular to the product longitudinal direction L is called the product widthwise direction W. The disposable diaper 10 according to present embodiment includes an absorber 40 spanning the crotch region 25 and extending toward at the front waistline region 20 and the back waistline region 30. The absorber 40 is configured by an absorbent core and a core wrap. The absorber core is same as in the conventional disposable diaper, and can be configured appropriately by using popular components and materials, such as ground pulp and high absorbent polymer. The absorber core is wrapped by the sheet-like core wrap. The core wrap is a sheet for wrapping the absorber core. A part of at least the skin surface contact side of the core wrap is configured by various fibrous nonwoven fabrics or a tissue sheet having liquid-permeability. For example, an air-through fibrous nonwoven cloth, a spunbond nonwoven cloth, or an SMS (spunbond - meltblown - spunbond) nonwoven cloth having a mass of approximately 10 to 30 g/m2, or a tissue sheet having a mass of approximately 10 to 30 g/m2 can be used as the component configuring the core wrap. Further, as shown in Fig. 1, a pair of leg stretching units (leg gathers) 75 formed along the leg hole opening units 35 and stretchable in at least the product longitudinal direction L. For example, the leg stretching units 75 each may be composed of a predetermined number of elastic members (two elastic members in the example of Fig. 1). Also, the leg stretching units 75 each may be formed of a stretchable sheet member. Also, a topsheet (not shown) which is a transparent nonwoven cloth sheet is provided at a surface side (a skin contact surface side) of an absorber 40, and a backsheet 60 which is composed of a nonwoven cloth sheet is provided at a back face side (a non-skin contact surface side) of the absorber 40. Furthermore, a liquid-impermeable leakage preventing sheet (not shown) is provided between the topsheet 50 and the backsheet 60. A side flap 70 is provided at both side edges in the product widthwise direction W of the absorber 40. The side flaps 70 are made of one or two or more pieces of nonwoven fabrics overlapping one another. Also, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the disposable diaper 10 according to the embodiment is provided with a pair of fastening tapes 90 configured to extend to the outside of the product widthwise direction W from both side edges of the disposable diaper 10 in the front waistline region 20 (or the back waistline region 30). In addition, the disposable diaper 10 according to the embodiment is provided with a target tape 90B in a predetermined region of the non-skin contact surface side of the back waistline region 30 (or the front waistline region 20). Here, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, at the fastening tape 90, a hook unit 90A is provided, and the hook unit 90A of the fastening tape 90 is mounted to the target tape 90B, whereby the disposable diaper 10 can be retained at the wearer's body. Here, the fastening tape 90 is composed of a plurality of nonwoven cloth sheets. As shown in Fig. 4, in the disposable diaper 10 according to the embodiment, the fastening tapes 90 are composed of two nonwoven cloth sheets 91 and 92. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, at both of the side edges as mentioned above, embossment 60a is provided at the backsheet 60 (a first nonwoven cloth sheet) which is provided at the most non-skin contact surface side of a respective one of the nonwoven cloth sheets (the backsheet 60 and the side flaps 70) that correspond to a joint region 100 in which the fastening tapes 90 is joined. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, embossment 91a having a same shape as or a similar shape to that of the embossment 60a that is provided at the backsheet 60 (the first nonwoven cloth sheet) in a nonwoven cloth sheet 91 which is provided at the most non-skin contact surface side of the respective one of the nonwoven cloth sheets 91 and 92 that constitute the fastening tapes 90. It is to be noted that the same shapes of embossment denotes that patterns which is formed of embossments 60a and 91a or dimensions which constitute the patterns (such as areas of the respective lattices) are the same as each other. It is also to be noted that the similar shapes of embossment denotes that, although the patterns formed of embossment 60a and embossment 91a are the same as each other, dimensions of shapes which constitute the patterns are different from each other or either width or height is stretched or shrunk while the shapes ( For example, a triangle or a square) are maintained. Alternatively, the backsheet (the first nonwoven cloth sheet) and the nonwoven cloth sheet 91 may be composed of a nonwoven cloth which is generated by a same kind of manufacturing method. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4, embossment 92a which is different from the embossment 91a that is provided with respect to the nonwoven cloth sheet 91 may be provided at the nonwoven cloth sheet 92 other than the nonwoven cloth sheet 91 that constitutes the fastening tapes 90. Further, as shown in Fig. 3, it may be that corners 93 in the fastening tapes 90 that extend from both side edges of the disposable diaper each are cut in an arc shape, and that corners 60b at both side edges of the disposable diaper each are cut in an arc shape. Furthermore, it is preferable that a value of KES bending rigidity per unit length in the product longitudinal direction L all over the fastening tape 90 and a value of KES bending rigidity per unit length in the product widthwise direction W all over the fastening tape 90 each are adapted to be smaller than 1.45 gf •cm2/cm. The flexural properties were measured by using KES-FB2 manufactured by KATO TECH CO., LTD., by fixing each sample (such each sample obtained by cutting out the fastening tape 90 together with the nonwoven cloth sheets 91 and 92) between the chucks (while facing down the skin contact surface side (the inside) of the fastening tape 90 in the disposable diaper 10), bending to the front up to maximum curvature +2.5 cm-1, and then bending to the back up to maximum curvature -2.5 cm-1, and then returning to the origin. The value of KES bending rigidity can be set to be smaller than 1.45 gf •cm2/cm by employing a plurality of nonwoven cloth sheets which constitute the fastening tapes 90 or by controlling types of the respective nonwoven cloth sheets or embossment rate forming a pattern or the like. Further, at the target tape 90B, there may be provided embossment having a similar shape to that of the embossment 91a that is provided at a respective one of the backsheet (the first nonwoven cloth sheet) and the nonwoven cloth sheet 91. Here, each nonwoven cloth sheet is formed by laminating single-layered fibers, more preferably by laminating multi-layered fibers. The target tape 90B is composed of a plurality of nonwoven cloth sheets like the fastening tapes 90 or the backsheet 60. In this manner, at the time of wearing the disposable diaper 10, when the fastening tape 90 is mounted to the target tape 90B, a visually integrated pattern is formed all over the front waistline region 20 and the back waistline region 30, making it possible to impart a good impression that any element as a foreign matter is not present. Namely, nonwoven cloth sheets which constitute the target tapes 90B are formed by laminating multi-layered fibers, whereby the durability and engagement property that are required for the target tape 90B are easily achieved while embossment of a same or similar shape are provided. It is to be noted that, in a case where the exterior sheet is provided at the non-skin contact surface side of the backsheet 60, the first nonwoven cloth sheet that is provided at the most non-skin contact surface side of a respective one of the nonwoven cloth sheets that correspond to the joint region 100 is obtained as the exterior sheet in place of the backsheet 60. In so far as the disposable diaper 10 according to the embodiment is concerned, the embossment 91a having a same as or a similar shape to that of the embossment 60a that is provided at the backsheet 60 (the first nonwoven cloth sheet) is provided at the nonwoven cloth sheet 91 that is provided at a respective one of the most non-skin contact surface side of the respective one of the nonwoven cloth sheets 91 and 92 that constitute the fastening tapes 90, thus making it possible to impart an impression that a visual sense of integrity is felt between a respective one of the fastening tapes 90 and the backsheet 60 (or the exterior sheet). Also, the fastening tapes 90 each, as shown in Fig. 4, may be a structure which is sandwiched between the backsheet 60 and a respective one of the side flaps 70 or may be structured so as to be joined with an interior face of the respective one of the side flaps 70. According to the structure as mentioned above, the fastening tapes 90 are not released out to the non-skin contact surface side of the backsheet 60; and therefore, an impression of a visual sense of integrity all over the front waistline region 20 and the back waistline region 30 is improved more remarkably. In addition, it is preferable that nonwoven parts of the non-skin contact surface sides of the backsheets 60 and the fastening tapes 90 be composed of a crimped texture. It is preferable that it be constituted by employing a crimped fiber. As the crimped fiber, for example, there can be employed a fiber obtained by employing a heat shrink crimping approach. In a case where the heat shrink crimping approach is employed, a composite fiber according to a side-by-side type or a core-clad type made of polypropylene and polyethylene, for example, is spun, and then crimping can be developed by a heat shrink difference due to a difference in the melting point. In particular, it is preferable to employ a composite fiber which is obtained by a heat shrink crimping approach according to an eccentric core-clad type while polypropylene is employed as a core and copolymer of ethylene/propylene is employed as a clad, since a desired crimping count, a crimping rate, a crimping and stretching rate, a crimping and restoring rate or the like can be adjusted. By employing such a crimped fiber, the bulkiness of the fiber is easily developed, and an image which is closer to a cloth (in particular, a kilting-like cloth in the embodiment) can be exhibited. In addition, together with embossment, an image which is further closer to a cloth (a kilting-like cloth) can be exhibited. As described above, the present invention has been described in detail by using the above-described embodiment. However, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described in this description. The present invention can be modified and changed without departing from the gist and the scope of the present invention defined by the appended claims. Therefore, the description is aimed at illustration and explanation of the present invention, and does not have any meaning which limits the present invention. It is to be noted that all the contents of Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-259164 (which was filed in November 27, 2012) are incorporated in the present specification by reference. [Industrial Applicability] It is possible to provide a disposable diaper which is capable of imparting an impression that a visual sense of integrity is felt between a respective one of fastening tapes and another portion which is formed of a nonwoven cloth.
