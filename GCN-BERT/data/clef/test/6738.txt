[84] In addition to making the macrocyclic compounds of Formula I, the process described herein may be used to generate the polymers of Formula II. Such polymers can be used for a variety of application, including cosmetics, coatings, medical devices, and time-release formulations, as well as any other appropriate polymer applications. These new polymers can contain either alternating ether/ester linkages, or ether/amide linkages. [85] The polymers described herein (of Formula II) can be used as precursors to produce macrocyclic compounds (of Formula I) that contain an ether linkage. As an example, and as illustrated in Scheme 1 below, polymers can be formed by esterifying and etherifying an olefinic acid and/or ester {e.g., compound 1a or 1b in Scheme 1 ) with a suitable diol of the type described in Scheme 1 {e.g., compound 2) under suitable conditions {e.g., acidic conditions; e.g., elevated temperatures; e.g., reaction times ranging from hours to days). The resulting monomer (e.g., compound 3) can then be polymerized to form a polymer {e.g., compound 5) {e.g., under vacuum distillation conditions) in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as a basic catalyst {e.g., potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, magnesium oxide, or basic alumina). The extent to which the diol (compound 2) is removed from the reaction mixture can influence the polymerization reaction. In one embodiment, the amount of diol (compound 2) removed from the reaction mixture {e.g., by distillation) is inversely proportional to the average molecular weight of the polymer product. The macrocyclic compound {e.g., compound 4) can be separated from the reaction mixture {e.g., by distillation) upon depolymerization/lactonization of the polymer (compound 5), which occurs via the intramolecular esterification of a terminal hydroxyl group with an internal ester group. The resulting polymer (compound 5) is a new type of ester/ether polymer, and the resulting macrocyclic compound (compound 4) is a new type of ester/ether macrocycle. The variables in Scheme 1 below, such as R1 , R2, X, Z, etc. are as defined in Formulae l-V above. heme 1 [86] In some embodiments, an esterification procedure may occur before, concurrently with, or after an etherification procedure. In some embodiments, polymerization and/or lactonization reactions may occur during a first and/or second distillation procedure. In some embodiments, a compound of Formula II {e.g., compound 5 in Scheme 1 ) may be isolated from the reaction mixture in a first or a second distillation procedure. In some embodiments, a compound of Formula I wherein X is O {e.g., compound 4 in Scheme 1 ) may be reacted with pressurized ammonia to produce a corresponding compound of Formula I wherein X is NH {e.g., compound 6 in Scheme 1 ). [87] In some embodiments, 2,6-dimethyl-6-methoxyheptanoic acid is combined with 1 ,6-hexanediol and methanesulfonic acid in an organic solvent {e.g., toluene) and heated, to 25 °C - 200 °C {e.g., to 25 °C, e.g., to 50 °C, e.g., to 75 °C, e.g., to 100 °C, e.g., to 1 10 °C, e.g., to 120 °C, e.g., to 130 °C, e.g., to 140 °C, e.g., to 150 °C, e.g., to 160 °C, e.g., to 180 °C, e.g., to 200 °C), for 0.5 - 10 hours {e.g., 0.5 hours, e.g., 1 hour, e.g., 2 hours, e.g., 3 hours, e.g., 4 hours, e.g., 5 hours, e.g., 6 hours, e.g., 8 hours, e.g., 10 hours) to perform the esterification step. The reaction is then cooled, to 25 °C - 100 °C (e.g., to 20-30 °C, e.g., to 30-40 °C, e.g., to 40-50 °C, e.g., to 50-60 °C, e.g., to 60- 70 °C, e.g., to 70-80 °C, e.g., to 80-90 °C, e.g., to 90-100 °C) and additional 1 ,6- hexanediol is added to the reaction mixture to perform the etherification step. The reaction is kept stirring at the cooled temperature for, 1 hour - 4 days {e.g., 1 hour, e.g., 6 hours, e.g., 12 hours, e.g., 1 day, e.g., 2 days, e.g., 3 days, e.g., 4 days) before quenching the reaction with a basic aqueous solution {e.g., 10 wt.% Na2COs) until the pH of the reaction mixture is slightly basic {e.g., pH = 8). A polar organic solvent {e.g., ethyl acetate) is added to reaction mixture and the phases are separated. The organic phase is washed with brine and then dried with a drying agent {e.g., Na2SO ). The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the organic phase solvent is subsequently removed by evaporation, yielding a residue. An inorganic catalyst {e.g., MgO) and quenching agent {e.g., Na2CO3) are added to the residue, and fractional distillation (the first distillation) is performed. After removing a majority of the light fraction, the macrolactone product is removed from the remaining reaction mixture by distillation (the second distillation). The macrolactone product may be further purified {e.g., by flash column chromatography). Residue in the reaction vessel after distillation includes polymer {e.g., poly(6-((6-hydroxyhexyl)oxy)-2,6-dimethylheptanoic acid)). Product compositions and yields are determined by, e.g., NMR. [88] In some embodiments, citronellic acid is combined with 1 ,6-hexanediol and methanesulfonic acid in an organic solvent {e.g., toluene) and heated, to 25 °C - 200 °C {e.g., to 25 °C, e.g., to 50 °C, e.g., to 75 °C, e.g., to 100 °C, e.g., to 1 10 °C, e.g., to 120 °C, e.g., to 130 °C, e.g., to 140 °C, e.g., to 150 °C, e.g., to 160 °C, e.g., to 180 °C, e.g., to 200 °C), for 0.5 - 10 hours {e.g., 0.5 hours, e.g., 1 hour, e.g., 2 hours, e.g., 3 hours, e.g., 4 hours, e.g., 5 hours, e.g., 6 hours, e.g., 8 hours, e.g., 10 hours) to perform the esterification step. The reaction is then cooled, to 25 °C - 100 °C {e.g., to 20-30 °C, e.g., to 30-40 °C, e.g., to 40-50 °C, e.g., to 50-60 °C, e.g., to 60-70 °C, e.g., to 70-80 °C, e.g., to 80-90 °C, e.g., to 90-100 °C) and additional 1 ,6-hexanediol is added to the reaction mixture to perform the etherification step. The reaction is kept stirring at the cooled temperature for, 1 hour to 4 days {e.g., 1 hour, e.g., 6 hours, e.g., 12 hours, e.g., 1 day, e.g., 2 days, e.g., 3 days, e.g., 4 days) before quenching the reaction with a basic aqueous solution {e.g., 10 wt.% Na2COs) until the pH of the reaction mixture is slightly basic (e.g., pH = 8).

[89] In some embodiments, citronellic acid is combined with 1 ,3-propanediol and methanesulfonic acid in an organic solvent (e.g., toluene) and heated, to 25 °C - 200 °C (e.g., to 25 °C, e.g., to 50 °C, e.g., to 75 °C, e.g., to 100 °C, e.g., to 1 10 °C, e.g., to 120 °C, e.g., to 130 °C, e.g., to 140 °C, e.g., to 150 °C, e.g., to 160 °C, e.g., to 180 °C, e.g., to 200 °C) for 0.5 - 10 hours (e.g., 0.5 hours, e.g., 1 hour, e.g., 2 hours, e.g., 3 hours, e.g., 4 hours, e.g., 5 hours, e.g., 6 hours, e.g., 8 hours, e.g., 10 hours), during which water is removed from the reaction, to perform the esterification step.

Residue in the reaction vessel after distillation includes polymer {e.g., poly(7-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-3,7- dimethyloctanoic acid)). Product compositions and yields are determined e.g., by NMR. [91] The process described herein can be applied using many different combinations of olefinic acids or esters and diols, resulting in a large variety of new compositions of matter. Further, the olefinic acids and esters can be etherified or hydroxylated at the most highly substituted carbon of the olefin and used as a functional equivalent to the olefin. For example, Scheme 2 shows three functional equivalents for this process, where R1 , R3, and R4 are as defined in Formula III above. Scheme 2 [92] Non-limiting examples of suitable olefinic acids and esters for the processes described herein include those depicted in Table 1 below, as well as their substituted and/or unsaturated analogs and functional equivalents. One of the === is a double bond and the other is a single bond, and R3 is as defined in Formula III above. Table 1 [93] Several of the molecules in Table 1 , above, can be derived from renewable resources such as terpenes {e.g., citronellic acid and/or citronellenes) or unsaturated vegetable oil fatty acids. When obtaining these molecules from unsaturated fatty acids, metathesis of the fatty acids with a suitable olefin such as isobutylene or 2,3- dimethylbutene, or reductive ozonolysis followed by Wittig-type olefination, may yield suitable starting materials. Metathesis of fatty acids may also give rise to internal olefins that can then undergo olefin isomerization to produce compounds of the type described in Table 1 . In general, the olefins and corresponding functional equivalents can also be made by adding organometallic species to esters, performing Wittig- or Horner- Wadsworth-Emmons-type olefinations of aldehydes, or by performing metathesis reactions on suitable olefin precursors. [94] Suitable diols for the process described herein include, e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, erythritol, pentaerythiritol, sorbitol, 1 ,3-propanediol, glycerol, 1 ,4- butanediol, 1 ,4-butenediol, 1 ,4- butynediol, 1 ,5-pentanediol, 1 ,6, hexanediol, 1 ,6- hexenediol, 1 ,6-hexynediol, 1 ,7-heptanediol, 1 ,8-octanediol, 1 ,9-nonanediol, 1 ,10- decanediol, 1 ,1 1 -dodecanediol, 1 ,12-doedecanediol, 1 ,13-tridecanediol, 1 ,14- tetradecanediol, 1 ,15-pentadecanediol, and 1 ,16-hexadecanediol, as well as their substituted, polymeric, and/or unsaturated analogs. Diols that are removed from the reaction mixtures described herein by distillation can be reused. [95] The polymers obtained from this process may possess olefinic terminal groups, as described in Scheme 1 and as indicated in Formula II. These olefinic groups can be used to further grow the polymer and add additional functionality. Methods to prepare and grow olefinic polymers include free radical polymerization, metathesis polymerization, anionic polymerization, and/or cationic polymerization. Table 2 below includes representative polymers that can be obtained by the processes described herein, where n is as defined in Formula II above. Table 2 [96] Representative macrocyclic compounds that can be obtained from the processes described herein are shown in Table 3. Table 3 [97] The macrocyclic compounds described herein can be used themselves, or as monomers for ring-opening polymerization. In some embodiments, an ester group oxygen atom of the macrocyclic compound of the application can be replaced with a nitrogen atom under high pressure with ammonia, thus allowing access to polyamide production (see e.g., Ritz, J., Fuchs, H., Kieczka, H. and Moran, W.C. 2011 Caprolactam. Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry). Scheme 3 below depicts a general synthesis route to convert macrocyclic ethers of the application to analogous macrocyclic amines and polyamines. The variables in Scheme 3 below, such as R1 , R2, n, and Z, are as defined in Formulae I and II above. Scheme 3 [98] The details of one or more embodiments of the application are set forth in the accompanying description below. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this application belongs. In the case of conflict, the present specification will control. [99] Unless otherwise indicated, it is to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of terms, which shall be defined to have the definitions set forth below. [100] As used herein, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a reactant" includes not only a single reactant but also a combination or mixture of two or more different reactant, reference to "a substituent" includes a single substituent as well as two or more substituents, and the like. [101] As used herein, the phrases "for example," "for instance," "such as," or "including" are meant to introduce examples that further clarify more general subject matter. These examples are provided only as an aid for understanding the disclosure, and are not meant to be limiting in any fashion. Furthermore as used herein, the terms "may," "optional," "optionally," or "may optionally" mean that the subsequently described circumstance may or may not occur, so that the description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. For example, the phrase "optionally present" means that an object may or may not be present, and, thus, the description includes instances wherein the object is present and instances wherein the object is not present. [102] As used herein, the phrase "having the formula" or "having the structure" is not intended to be limiting and is used in the same way that the term "comprising" is commonly used. [103] "Isomerism" means compounds that have identical molecular formulae but differ in the sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in space. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers". Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereoisomers", and stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed "enantiomers" or sometimes optical isomers. A mixture containing equal amounts of individual enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality is termed a "racemic mixture". [104] A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical substituents is termed a "chiral center." [105] "Chiral isomer" means a compound with at least one chiral center. Compounds with more than one chiral center may exist either as an individual diastereomer or as a mixture of diastereomers, termed "diastereomeric mixture." When one chiral center is present, a stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration (R or S) of that chiral center. Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the chiral center. The substituents attached to the chiral center under consideration are ranked in accordance with the Sequence Rule of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. (Cahn et al., Angew. Chem. Inter. Edit. 1966, 5, 385; errata 51 1 ; Cahn et al., Angew. Chem. 1966, 78, 413; Cahn and Ingold, J. Chem. Soc. 1951 (London), 612; Cahn et al., Experientia 1956, 12, 81 ; Cahn, J. Chem. Educ. 1964, 41, 1 16). In some formulae of the present application, one or more chiral centers are identified by an asterisk placed next to the chiral carbon. In other formulae, no chiral center is identified, but the chiral isomers are nonetheless covered by these formulae. [106] "Geometric isomer" means the diastereomers that owe their existence to hindered rotation about double bonds. These configurations are differentiated in their names by the prefixes cis and trans, or Z and E, which indicate that the groups are on the same or opposite side of the double bond in the molecule according to the Cahn- Ingold-Prelog rules. [107] Some compounds of the present application can exist in a tautomeric form which is also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present application. "Tautomers" refers to compounds whose structures differ markedly in arrangement of atoms, but which exist in easy and rapid equilibrium. It is to be understood that the compounds of the application may be depicted as different tautomers. It should also be understood that when compounds have tautomeric forms, all tautomeric forms are intended to be within the scope of the application, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any tautomeric form. Further, even though one tautomer may be described, the present application includes all tautomers of the present compounds. [108] As used herein, the term "salt" can include acid addition salts including hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates, sulfates, hydrogen sulfates, alkylsulfonates, arylsulfonates, acetates, benzoates, citrates, maleates, fumarates, succinates, lactates, and tartrates; alkali metal cations such as Na+, K+, Li+, alkali earth metal salts such as Mg2+ or Ca2+, or organic amine salts, or organic phosphonium salts. [109] The term "alkyl" as used herein refers to a monovalent or bivalent, branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group typically although not necessarily containing 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n- butyl, isobutyl, f-butyl, octyl, and the like. [110] The term "alkenyl" as used herein refers to a monovalent or bivalent, branched or unbranched, unsaturated hydrocarbon group typically although not necessarily containing 2 to about 12 carbon atoms and 1 -10 carbon-carbon double bonds, such as ethylene, n-propylene, isopropylene, n-butylene, isobutylene, f-butylene, octylene, and the like. [111] The term "alkynyl" as used herein refers to a monovalent or bivalent, branched or unbranched, unsaturated hydrocarbon group typically although not necessarily containing 2 to about 12 carbon atoms and 1 -6 carbon-carbon triple bonds, such as ethyne, propyne, butyne, pentyne, hexyne, heptyne, octyne, and the like. [112] By "substituted" as in "substituted alkyl," "substituted alkenyl," "substituted alkynyl," and the like, it is meant that in the alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or other moiety, at least one hydrogen atom bound to a carbon atom is replaced with one or more non- hydrogen substituents, e.g., by a functional group. [113] Examples of functional groups include, without limitation: halo, hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, Ci-C24 alkoxy, C2-C24 alkenyloxy, C2-C24 alkynyloxy, C5-C20 aryloxy, acyl (including C2-C24 alkylcarbonyl (-CO-alkyl) and C6-C2o arylcarbonyl (-CO-aryl)), acyloxy (-O-acyl), C2-C24 alkoxycarbonyl (-(CO)-O-alkyl), C6-C2o aryloxycarbonyl (-(CO)-O-aryl), halocarbonyl (-CO)-X where X is halo), C2-C24 alkylcarbonato (-O-(CO)-O-alkyl), C6-C20 arylcarbonato (-O-(CO)-O-aryl), carboxy (-COOH), carboxylato (-COO" ), carbamoyl (- (CO)-NH2), mono-substituted d-C24 alkylcarbamoyl (-(CO)-NH(Ci-C24 alkyl)), di- substituted alkylcarbamoyl (-(CO)-N(C C24 alkyl)2), mono-substituted arylcarbamoyl (- (CO)-NH-aryl), thiocarbamoyl (-(CS)-NH2), carbamido (-NH-(CO)-NH2), cyano (-C≡N), isocyano (-N+≡C"), cyanato (-O-C≡N), isocyanato (-O-N+≡C"), isothiocyanato (-S-C≡N), azido (-N=N+=N"), formyl (-(CO)-H), thioformyl (-(CS)-H), amino (-NH2), mono- and di- (C C24 alkyl)-substituted amino, mono- and di-(C5-C20 aryl)-substituted amino, C2-C24 alkylamido (-NH-(CO)-alkyl), C5-C20 arylamido (-NH-(CO)-aryl), imino (-CR=NH where R = hydrogen, Ci-C24 alkyl, C5-C2o aryl, C6-C2o alkaryl, C6-C2o aralkyl, etc.), alkylimino (- CR=N(alkyl), where R = hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, etc.), arylimino (-CR=N(aryl), where R = hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, etc.), nitro (-NO2), nitroso (-NO), sulfo (-SO2- OH), sulfonato (-SO2-O"), d-C24 alkylsulfanyl (-S-alkyl; also termed "alkylthio"), arylsulfanyl (-S-aryl; also termed "arylthio"), Ci-C24 alkylsulfinyl (-(SO)-alkyl), C5-C2o arylsulfinyl (-(SO)-aryl), Ci-C24 alkylsulfonyl (-SO2-alkyl), C5-C20 arylsulfonyl (-SO2-aryl), phosphono (-P(O)(OH)2), phosphonato (-P(O)(O")2), phosphinato (-P(O)(O")), phospho (-PO2),-phosphino (-PH2), mono- and di-(Ci-C24 alkyl)-substituted phosphino, mono- and di-(C5-C2o aryl)-substituted phosphino; and the hydrocarbyl moieties such as Ci-C24 alkyl (including C1-C18 alkyl, further including Ci-Ci2 alkyl, and further including C1-C6 alkyl), C2-C24 alkenyl (including C2-Cis alkenyl, further including C2-Ci2 alkenyl, and further including C2-C6 alkenyl), C2-C2 alkynyl (including C2-Ci8 alkynyl, further including C2-Ci2 alkynyl, and further including C2-C6 alkynyl), C5-C3o aryl (including C5- C2o aryl, and further including C5-Ci2 aryl), and C6-C3o aralkyl (including C6-C2o aralkyl, and further including C6-Ci2 aralkyl). In addition, the aforementioned functional groups may, if a particular group permits, be further substituted with one or more additional functional groups or with one or more hydrocarbyl moieties such as those specifically enumerated above. [114] In the present specification, the structural formula of the compound represents a certain isomer for convenience in some cases, but the present application includes all isomers, such as geometrical isomers, optical isomers based on an asymmetrical carbon, stereoisomers, tautomers, and the like. In addition, a crystal polymorphism may be present for the compounds represented by the formula. It is noted that any crystal form, crystal form mixture, or anhydride or hydrate thereof is included in the scope of the present application. [115] All percentages used herein, unless otherwise indicated, are by volume. [116] All ratios used herein, unless otherwise indicated, are by molarity.

The reaction was cooled to 50-60 °C and additional 1 ,6-hexanediol (36 g) was added to the mixture. The reaction was then kept stirring at this temperature for 2 days before quenching the reaction with aqueous Na2CO3 (10% (w/v)) at room temperature (until pH = 8). Ethyl acetate (100 ml) was added to the mixture and the phases were separated. The organic phase was washed with brine (150 ml) and then dried with Na2SO4. The Na2SO4 was filtered out and solvent was removed from the organic phase by evaporation, resulting in a red liquid residue (167 g). MgO (4 g) and Na2CO3 (4 g) were added to an aliquot of the residue (80 g) and fractional distillation was performed by heating the mixture from 25 to 250 °C under vacuum. After removing most of the light fraction at 1 .0-1 .6 mbar, the final fraction containing the macrolactone product was distilled from the remaining reaction mixture at 200-260 °C under 0.1 -0.5 mbar vacuum. Purification of the final distillation fraction by flash column chromatography gave 2 g of macrolactone product (silica gel, 2-7.5% ethyl acetate/heptane). Residue in the reaction vessel after distillation (28 g) comprised poly(6-((6-hydroxyhexyl)oxy)-2,6- dimethylheptanoic acid), MgO, and Na2CO3.

The reaction was cooled to 50-60 °C and additional 1 ,6-hexanediol (34.5 g) was added to the mixture. The reaction was then kept stirring at this temperature for 2 days before quenching the reaction with aqueous Na2CO3 (10% (w/v)) at room temperature (until pH = 8). Ethyl acetate (100 ml) was added to the mixture and the phases were separated. The organic phase was washed with brine (150 ml) and then dried with Na2SO4. The Na2SO4was filtered out and solvent was removed from the organic phase by evaporation, resulting in a red liquid residue (107 g). MgO (5 g) and Na2CO3 (5 g) were added to the residue and fractional distillation was performed by heating the mixture from 25 to 260 °C under vacuum. After removing most of the light fraction at 0.5-1 .0 mbar, the final fraction containing the macrolactone product was distilled from the remaining reaction mixture at 200-270 °C under 0.3-0.5 mbar vacuum.
