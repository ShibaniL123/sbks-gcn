Step 3: Preparation of (S)-5-(1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethylamino)-3-cyclopropyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
34 mg of (S)-5-(1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethylamino)-3-cyclopropyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was prepared as a white solid by using 43 mg (0.07 mmol) of (S)-5-(1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethylamino)-3-cyclopropyl-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one prepared in step 2 according to the same manner as described in step 8 of Example 1 (0.07 mmol, yield: 99%).
