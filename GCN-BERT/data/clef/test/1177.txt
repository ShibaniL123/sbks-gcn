CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims benefit from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/952,736, filed Mar. 13, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to methods for the treatment of depression and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by administering ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof (hereinafter referred to as “ibogaine”) at a therapeutic dosage that provides both an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL and a QT interval prolongation of no more than about 50 milliseconds. STATE OF THE ART Depressive disorders include major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994a; American Psychiatric Association, 1994b). Major depressive disorder is characterized by the occurrence of one or more major depressive episodes without manic or hypomanic episodes. A major depressive episode is defined as a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it can include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. Dysthymic disorder involves a type of depression that is not severe enough to be called a major depressive episode, but that lasts much longer than major depressive disorder, without high phases. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as defined by DSM-III-R/IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1987; American Psychiatric Association, 1994a), requires exposure to a traumatic event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and a response which involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Although PTSD is classified as an anxiety disorder, PTSD is unique from other anxiety disorders because of the requirement of exposure to a traumatic event. Symptoms that occur as a result of exposure to the traumatic event include re-experiencing of the event in the form of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or dreams, and intense psychological distress and physiological reactivity on exposure to cues to the event; avoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic event, inability to recall details of the event, and/or numbing of general responsiveness manifested as diminished interest in significant activities, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, or sense of foreshortened future; and symptoms of autonomic arousal including hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and irritability or outbursts of anger. A PTSD diagnosis requires that the symptoms are present for at least a month and that they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The CDC estimates that about 1 in 10 adults in the United States suffer from depression. High levels of depression correlate with high rates of other diseases, including obesity, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, PTSD affects approximately 8% of Americans at some point in their lives. More strikingly, up to 30% of people, including veterans, who spend time in war zones develop PTSD. PTSD is increasingly recognized as a major issue for U.S. troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as those who served in previous wars, and is a potential contributor to the high rate of suicide among veterans. Given the prevalence and impact of depression and PTSD, there is a need for treatments that address these issues. Prior to the embodiments described herein, the therapeutic dosing of ibogaine and its derivatives for treating depression and/or PTSD in humans at an acceptable QT interval prolongation has not previously been addressed, especially as it relates to dosing protocols that are effective, as well as safe. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Ibogaine has been used as a botanical preparation from the root bark of iboga tabernathe for over 100 years, both as a crude preparation and as semisynthetic ibogaine, which was marketed in France until about 1970. While ibogaine has been disclosed for treatment of depression, its use in humans is complicated by the fact that the ranges generally used to treat addiction (e.g., 15 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg) cause hallucinations and may be fatal. Lotsof and Wachtel, Manual for Ibogaine Therapy: Screening, Safety, Monitoring & Aftercare (2d revision, 2003), accessed at www.ibogaine.desk.nl/manual.html; Hoelen, et al. New Engl. J. Med. 360(3), 308 (2009), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all of its methods, compositions and teachings. The present invention relates to methods of treating depression and/or PTSD, or symptoms thereof, comprising administering to a patient ibogaine, an ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof thereof. A prolonged QT interval is a marker of potential Torsades de Pointes, a serious arrhythmia that can result in death. Serious complications, including ventricular tachyarrhythmia and death, can result from prolongation of the treated patient's QT interval by ibogaine, rendering high doses of ibogaine unacceptable. Heretofore, it was unclear whether a therapeutic dose of ibogaine could be found that resulted in QT interval prolongation within an acceptable range. It is expected that other compounds that share ibogaine's core structure will have a similar prolongation effect on QT interval. See, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/945,746 filed Feb. 27, 2014 entitled METHOD FOR ACUTE AND LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF DRUG ADDICTION, which application is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The current invention is predicated on the surprising discovery that treatment with a narrow dosage range of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, between greater than about 1 mg/kg body weight and about 8 mg/kg body weight, provides a therapeutic reduction in symptoms of depression and/or PTSD in affected patients. Preferably, the dose range that provide both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds is between about 1.3 mg per kg body weight and no more than about 4 mg per kg body weight and, more preferably between about 1.3 mg per kg body weight and no more than about 3 mg per kg body weight, or any subrange or subvalue within the aforementioned ranges. Furthermore, at very low doses, direct blood stream delivery of ibogaine may reduce symptoms of depression and/or PTSD. Such dosing is well below that previously described. Direct blood stream delivery of ibogaine enhances the amount of ibogaine delivered to the brain, because ibogaine does not pass through the liver as it does when ingested. Direct blood stream delivery of ibogaine includes sublingual, pulmonary and intranasal delivery where the ibogaine is absorbed directly into the blood stream and then into the brain. The rapid delivery of ibogaine into the brain, e.g. less than 15 minutes, may cause a significant reduction in symptoms of depression and/or PTSD. In one aspect, this invention relates to treating depression and/or PTSD in a patient in need thereof comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof. In one embodiment, this invention treats depression. In another embodiment, this invention treats PTSD. In a preferred embodiment, the patient is not addicted to cocaine or an opiate. Unlike PTSD, conventional anxiety disorders are not within the scope of this invention. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of ibogaine or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient is sufficient to provide an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL (area under the curve/24 hours), or any subrange or subvalue there between. In a preferred embodiment, the dose of ibogaine or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 400 ng/mL. In one embodiment, the dose of ibogaine or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 200 ng/mL. In a preferred embodiment, the narrow therapeutic doses of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate described above unexpectedly do not prolong the QT interval to unacceptable levels in human patients. In some embodiments, the patient will be pre-screened to evaluate tolerance for prolongation of QT interval, e.g., to determine whether the patient has any pre-existing cardiac conditions which would disqualify him/her from treatment with ibogaine or ibogaine derivative. In some embodiments, the serum concentration is sufficient to inhibit or ameliorate symptoms of depression and/or PTSD while maintaining a QT interval of less than 500 milliseconds (ms) during said treatment. In some embodiments, the dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 50 ms. In some embodiments, the dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 30 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 20 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the patient is tested to determine QT interval before treatment with ibogaine, and if the clinician determines that the QT prolongation would be unacceptable risk, ibogaine therapy will be contraindicated. In another aspect, this invention provides a method for treating depression and/or PTSD in a patient in need thereof comprising administering to the patient ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or salt and/or solvate thereof in a sustained release manner such that the serum concentration of ibogaine or ibogaine derivative is maintained at a therapeutically effective amount for a period of about 6 hours, about 12 hours, about 18 hours, about 24 hours, about 36 hours, about 48 hours, about 72 hours, about 96 hours, or a period of time between any two of these durations. DETAILED DESCRIPTION It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of this invention will be limited only by the appended claims. The detailed description of the invention is divided into various sections only for the reader's convenience and disclosure found in any section may be combined with that in another section. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a compound” includes a plurality of compounds. DEFINITIONS Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used herein the following terms have the following meanings. The term “about” when used before a numerical designation, e.g., temperature, time, amount, concentration, and such other, including a range, indicates approximations which may vary by (+) or (−) 10%, 5% or 1%. “Administration” refers to introducing an agent into a patient. Typically, an effective amount is administered, which amount can be determined by the treating physician or the like. Any route of administration, such as topical, subcutaneous, peritoneal, intraarterial, inhalation, vaginal, rectal, nasal, introduction into the cerebrospinal fluid, or instillation into body compartments can be used. The related terms and phrases “administering” and “administration of”, when used in connection with a compound or pharmaceutical composition (and grammatical equivalents) refer both to direct administration, which may be administration to a patient by a medical professional or by self-administration by the patient, and/or to indirect administration, which may be the act of prescribing a drug. For example, a physician who instructs a patient to self-administer a drug and/or provides a patient with a prescription for a drug is administering the drug to the patient. “Periodic administration” or “periodically administering” refers to multiple treatments that occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Periodic administration may also refer to administration of ibogaine, derivative, salt and/or solvate thereof one, two, three, or more times per day. Administration may be via transdermal patch, gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, intranasal, intrapulmonary, oral administration, or any other mode of administration. “Comprising” or “comprises” is intended to mean that the compositions and methods include the recited elements, but not excluding others. “Consisting essentially of” when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination for the stated purpose.

In the latter case, the hydrochloride salt is generally preferred, but other salts derived from organic or inorganic acids may also be used. Examples of such acids include, without limitation, those described below as “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” and the like. A “pharmaceutically acceptable solvate or hydrate” of a compound of the invention means a solvate or hydrate complex that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound, and includes, but is not limited to, complexes of a compound of the invention with one or more solvent or water molecules, or 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules. As used herein the term solvate is taken to mean that a solid-form of a compound that crystallizes with one or more molecules of solvent trapped inside. A few examples of solvents that can be used to create solvates, such as pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, include, but are certainly not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, C1-C6 alcohols in general (and optionally substituted), tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, acetic acid, formic acid, water, and solvent mixtures thereof. Other such biocompatible solvents which may aid in making a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate are well known in the art and applicable to the present invention. Additionally, various organic and inorganic acids and bases can be added or even used alone as the solvent to create a desired solvate. Such acids and bases are known in the art. When the solvent is water, the solvate can be referred to as a hydrate. Further, by being left in the atmosphere or recrystallized, the compounds of the present invention may absorb moisture, may include one or more molecules of water in the formed crystal, and thus become a hydrate. Even when such hydrates are formed, they are included in the term “solvate”. Solvate also is meant to include such compositions where another compound or complex co-crystallizes with the compound of interest. “Pharmaceutically acceptable composition” refers to a composition that is suitable for administration to a mammal, particularly, a human. Such compositions include various excipients, diluents, carriers, and such other inactive agents well known to the skilled artisan. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including pharmaceutically acceptable partial salts, of a compound, which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methane sulfonic acid, phosphorous acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, aconitic acid, salicylic acid, thalic acid, embonic acid, enanthic acid, oxalic acid and the like, and when the molecule contains an acidic functionality, include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like. “Therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of a drug or an agent that, when administered to a patient suffering from a condition, will have the intended therapeutic effect, e.g., alleviation, amelioration, palliation or elimination of one or more manifestations of the condition in the patient. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending upon the patient and the condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the condition, the salt, solvate, or derivative of the active drug portion chosen, the particular composition or excipient chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, timing of administration, the manner of administration and the like, all of which can be determined readily by one of ordinary skill in the art. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. For example, and without limitation, a therapeutically effective amount of an agent, in the context of treating depression and/or PTSD, refers to an amount of the agent that attenuates the depression and/or PTSD, and/or symptoms thereof, in the patient. The therapeutically effective amount of the compound may be higher or lower, depending on the route of administration used. For example, when direct blood administration (e.g., sublingual, pulmonary and intranasal delivery) is used, a lower dose of the compound is administered. In one aspect, a therapeutically effective amount of ibogaine or derivative is from about 50 ng to less than 100 μg per kg of body weight. Where other routes of administration are used, a higher dose of the compound is administered. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of the compound is from greater than about 1 mg to about 8 mg per kg of body weight per day. A “therapeutic level” of a drug is an amount of ibogaine or ibogaine derivative that is sufficient to treat depression and/or anxiety but not high enough to pose any significant risk to the patient. Therapeutic levels of drugs can be determined by tests that measure the actual concentration of the compound in the blood of the patient. This concentration is referred to as the “serum concentration.” Where the serum concentration of ibogaine is mentioned, it is to be understood that the term “ibogaine” encompasses any form of ibogaine, including derivatives thereof. “Treatment”, “treating”, and “treat” are defined as acting upon a disease, disorder, or condition with an agent to reduce or ameliorate harmful or any other undesired effects of the disease, disorder, or condition and/or its symptoms. “Treatment,” as used herein, covers the treatment of a human patient, and includes: (a) reducing the risk of occurrence of the condition in a patient determined to be predisposed to the disease but not yet diagnosed as having the condition, (b) impeding the development of the condition, and/or (c) relieving the condition, i.e., causing regression of the condition and/or relieving one or more symptoms of the condition. “Treating” or “treatment of” a condition or patient refers to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired results, including clinical results such as the reduction of symptoms. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, treating depression and/or PTSD. Depression occurring as a result of withdraw and/or use of an opiate or other illicit drug or substance is not within the scope of this invention. As used herein, the term “QT interval” refers to the measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of the heart. Prolongation of the QT interval refers to an increase in the QT interval. As used herein, the term “patient” refers to mammals and includes humans and non-human mammals.

For example, QT interval greater than 500 ms can be considered dangerous for individual patients. Pre-screening and/or monitoring may be necessary at high levels of ibogaine or ibogaine derivative treatment. In one embodiment, a patient receiving a therapeutic dose of ibogaine or ibogaine derivative is monitored in a clinical setting. Monitoring may be necessary to ensure the QT interval is not prolonged to an unacceptable degree. A “clinical setting” refers to an inpatient setting (e.g., inpatient clinic, hospital, or other facility) or an outpatient setting with frequent, regular monitoring (e.g., outpatient clinic that is visited daily or frequently). Monitoring includes monitoring of QT interval. Methods for monitoring of QT interval are well-known in the art, for example by ECG. In a preferred embodiment, the patient receiving treatment with ibogaine or derivative thereof is not monitored in a clinical setting. In one embodiment, the patient is monitored periodically, for example daily, weekly, monthly, or occasionally. In one aspect, this invention relates to a method for treating depression and/or PTSD and/or treating or attenuating the symptoms thereof in a patient, comprising selecting a patient exhibiting symptoms of depression and/or PTSD who is prescreened to evaluate the patient's expected tolerance for prolongation of QT interval, and administering to the patient a dosage of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL, said concentration being sufficient to inhibit or ameliorate said depression and/or PTSD or symptoms while maintaining a QT interval of less than 500 ms during said treatment. In some embodiments, the concentration is sufficient to attenuate said symptoms while maintaining a QT interval of less than about 470 ms during treatment. Preferably, the concentration is sufficient to attenuate said symptoms while maintaining a QT interval of less than about 450 ms during treatment. In one embodiment, the concentration is sufficient to attenuate said symptoms while maintaining a QT interval of less than about 420 ms during treatment. In some embodiments, the method comprises prescreening the patient. In one embodiment, prescreening of the patient comprises ascertaining that ibogaine or ibogaine derivative treatment will not result in a QT interval over about 500 ms. In one embodiment, prescreening of the patient comprises ascertaining that ibogaine or ibogaine derivative treatment will not result in a QT interval over about 470 ms. In one embodiment, prescreening comprises ascertaining that ibogaine or ibogaine derivative treatment will not result in a QT interval over about 450 ms. In one embodiment, prescreening comprises ascertaining that ibogaine or ibogaine derivative treatment will not result in a QT interval over about 420 ms. In one embodiment, prescreening comprises determining the patient's pre-treatment QT interval. As it relates to pre-screening or pre-selection of patients, patients may be selected based on any criteria as determined by the skilled clinician. Such criteria may include, by way of non-limiting example, pre-treatment QT interval, pre-existing cardiac conditions, risk of cardiac conditions, age, sex, general health, and the like. The following are examples of selection criteria for disallowing ibogaine or ibogaine derivative treatment or restricting dose of ibogaine or ibogaine derivative administered to the patient: high QT interval before treatment (e.g., such that there is a risk of the patient's QT interval exceeding 500 ms during treatment); congenital long QT syndrome; bradycardia; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; recent acute myocardial infarction; uncompensated heart failure; and taking other drugs that increase QT interval. In some embodiments, the methods can include selecting and/or administering/providing ibogaine or ibogaine derivative to a patient that lacks one more of such criteria. In one embodiment, this invention relates to pre-screening a patient to determine if the patient is at risk for prolongation of the QT interval beyond a safe level. In one embodiment, a patient at risk for prolongation of the QT interval beyond a safe level is not administered ibogaine or ibogaine derivative. In one embodiment, a patient at risk for prolongation of the QT interval beyond a safe level is administered ibogaine or ibogaine derivative at a limited dosage. In one embodiment, this invention relates to monitoring a patient who is administered a therapeutic dose of ibogaine or ibogaine derivative. In one embodiment, the dose of ibogaine or ibogaine derivative is reduced if the patient has serious adverse side effects. In one embodiment, the ibogaine or ibogaine derivative treatment is discontinued if the patient has serious adverse side effects. In one embodiment, the adverse side effect is a QT interval that is prolonged beyond a safe level. The determination of a safe level of prolongation is within the skill of a qualified clinician.

Examples Example 1 Forced Swim Test (FST) with Rats Animals: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, N.Y.) are used in all experiments. Rats are housed 5 per cage and maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Rats are handled for 1 minute each day for 4 days prior to behavioral testing. Drug Administration: Animals are randomly assigned to receive a single intraperitoneal administration of vehicle (2.5% EtOH/2.5% Tween-80), imipramine (positive control; 60 mg/kg), or Test Compound 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute test period. All injections are given using 1 cc tuberculin syringe with 26⅜ gauge needles (Becton-Dickinson, VWR Scientific, Bridgeport, N.J.). The volume of injection is 1 ml/kg. Experimental Design: The procedure used in this study employs a water depth of 31 cm. The greater depth in this test prevents the rats from supporting themselves by touching the bottom of the cylinder with their feet. Swim sessions are conducted by placing rats in individual plexiglass cylinders (46 cm tall and 20 cm diameter) containing 23-25° C. water. Swim tests are conducted always between 9:00 and 17:00 hours and included an initial 15-minute conditioning test followed 24 hours later by a 5-minute test. Drug treatments are administered 60 minutes before the 5-minute test period. Following all swim sessions, rats are removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels and placed in a heated cage for 15 minutes and returned to their home cages. All test sessions are videotaped using a color video camera and recorded for scoring later. Behavioral Scoring: The rat's behavior is rated at 5 second intervals during the 5 minute test by a single individual, who is blind to the treatment condition. Scored behaviors are: 1. Immobility—rat remains floating in the water without struggling and is only making those movements necessary to keep its head above water; 2. Climbing—rat is making active movements with its forepaws in and out of the water, usually directed against the walls; 3. Swimming—rat is making active swimming motions, more than necessary to merely maintain its head above water, e.g. moving around in the cylinder; and 4. Diving—entire body of the rat is submerged. Data Analysis: The forced swim test data (immobility, swimming, climbing, diving) are subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Newman-Keuls test. The data are analyzed using the GraphPad Prism (v2.01) (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). Example 2 Forced Swim Test (FST) with Mice Animals: DBA/2 mice (Taconic Farms, N.Y.) are used in all experiments. Animals are housed 5 per cage in a controlled environment under a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle. Animals are handled 1 min each day for 4 days prior to the experiment. This procedure includes a mock gavage with a 1.5 inch feeding tube. Drug Administration: Animals are randomly assigned to receive a single administration of vehicle (5% EtOH/5% Tween-80), Test Compound, or imipramine (60 mg/kg) by oral gavage 1 hour before the swim test. Experimental Design: The procedure for the forced swim test in the mouse is similar to that described above for the rat, with the following modifications. The cylinder used for the test is a 1 liter beaker (10.5 cm diameter and 15 cm height) filled to 800 ml (10 cm depth) with 23 25° C. water. Only one 5-minute swim test is conducted for each mouse, between 13:00 and 17:00 hours. Drug treatments are administered 30-60 minutes before the 5-minute test period. Following all swim sessions, mice are removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels and placed in a heated cage for 15 minutes. All test sessions are videotaped using a Sony color video camera and recorder for scoring later. Behavioral Scoring: The behavior during minutes 2-5 of the test is played back on a TV monitor and scored by the investigator. The total time spent immobile (animal floating with only minimal movements to remain afloat) and mobile (swimming and movements beyond those required to remain afloat) are recorded. Data Analysis: The forced swim test data (time exhibiting immobility, mobility; seconds) are subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Newman-Keuls test. The data are analyzed using the GraphPad Prism (v2.01) (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). Example 3 Effect of Ibogaine on QT Interval in Humans The safety of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is evaluated in patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.
