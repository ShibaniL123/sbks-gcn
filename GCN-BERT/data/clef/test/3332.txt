PUMICE-CONTAINING REMEDIAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS ΟΕ USE BACKGROUND [0001] The present invention relates to cementing operations and, .more particularly, in certain embodiments, to methods and compositions that utilize pumice and various additives, [0002] In cementing operations, such as well construction and remedial cementing, settable compositions are commonly utilized. As used herein, the term “settable composition” refers to a composition that hydraulically sets or otherwise develops compressive strength. Settable compositions may be used in primary cementing operations whereby pipe strings, such as easing and liners, are cemented in well bores. In a typical primary cementing operation, a settable composition may be pumped, into an annulus between the exterior surface of the pipe string disposed therein and the walls of the well bore for a larger conduit in the well bore). The settable composition may set in the annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened, substantially impermeable material (e.g„ a cement, sheath) that may support and position the pipe string in the well bore and may bond the exterior surface of the pipe string to the well bore walls for the larger conduit). Among other things, the cement, sheath surrounding the pipe string should function to prevent, the migration of fluids in the annulus, as well as protecting the pipe string from corrosion. Settable compositions also may be used in remedial cementing methods, such as in squeeze cementing for sealing voids in a pipe string, cement sheath, gravel pack, subterranean formation, and the like, [0003] In remedial cementing, settable compositions may be used for sealing voids in a pipe siring or a cement sheath. As used herein the term “void” refers to any type of space, including fractures, holes, cracks, channels, spaces, and the like. Such voids may include: holes or cracks in the pipe strings; holes, cracks, spaces, or channels in the cement sheath; and very small spaces {commonly referred to as fonicroannuif’) between the cement sheath and the exterior surface of the well casing or formation. Sealing such voids may prevent the undesired flow of .fluids (e.g,, oil, gas, water, etc.) and/or fine solids into, or from, the well bore. The sealing of such voids, whether or not made deliberately, has been attempted by introducing a substance into the void and permitting it to remain therein to sea! the void. If the substance does not fit into the void, a bridge, patch, or sheath maybe formed over the void to possibly produce a termination of the undesired fluid flow. Substances used heretofore in methods to terminate the undesired passage of fluids through such voids include settable compositions comprising water and hydraulic cement; wherein the methods employ hydraulic pressure to force the settable composition into the void. Once placed into the void, tile settable composition maybe permitted to harden. [0004] Remedial cementing operations also may be used to sea! portions of subterranean formations or portions of gravel packs. The portions of the subterranean formation may include permeable portions of a formation and fractures (natural or otherwise) in the formation and other portions of the formation that may allow the imdesired flow of fluid into, or from, the well bore. The portions of the gravel pack include those portions of the grave! pack, wherein it is desired to prevent the undesired flow of fluids into, or from, the welt bore, A “gravel pack” is a term commonly used to refer to a volume of particulate materials (such as sand) placed into a well bore to at least partially reduce the migration of unconsolidated formation particulates into the well bore. While screenless gravel packing operations are becoming more common, gravel packing operations commonly involve placing a gravel pack screen in the well bore neighboring a desired portion of the subterranean formation, and packing the surrounding annulus between the screen and the well bore with particulate materials that are sized to prevent and inhibit the passage of formation solids through the grave! pack with produced fluids. Among other things, this method may allow sealing; of the portion of the grave! pack to prevent the undesired flow of fluids without requiring the gravel pack's removal, [0005] A broad variety of settable compositions have been used heretofore, Including cement compositions comprising Portland cement. Portland cement Is generally prepared from a mixture of raw materials comprising calcium oxide, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, ferric oxide, and magnesium oxide. The mixture of the raw materials is heated in a kiln to approximately 2700° F, thereby initiating chemical reactions between the raw materials. In these reactions, crystalline compounds, dicalcium silicates, trica.lciu.tn silicates, tricalcium alummates, and tetracaleium aluminofsrrites, are formed. The product of these reactions is known as a clinker. The addition of a gypsum/anhydrate mixture to the clinker and the pulverization of the mixture results in a fine powder that will react to form a slurry upon the addition of water, [0006] There are drawbacks, however, to the conventional preparation and use of Portland cement. The energy requirements to produce Portland cement are quite high, and heat loss during production can further cause actual energy requirements to be even greater. These factors contribute significantly to the .relatively high cost of Portland cement Generally, Portland cement is a major component of the cost of hydraulic cement compositions that comprise Portland cement. Recent Portland cement shortages, however, have further contributed to the rising cost of hydraulic cement compositions that comprise Portland cement. SUMMARY [0007] An embodiment provides a method of remedial cementing in a subterranean formation comprising: providing a lightweight settable composition comprising pumice, a calcium activator, and water, wherein the lightweight settable composition Sias a density of less than about 13.5 pounds per gallon and is free of Portland cement; and using the lightweight settable composition in a remedial cementing method to seal, one or more voids hi a well bore.

[00411 An example of a method of the present: invention is method of sealing a portion of a gravel pack or a portion of a subterranean formation. An example of such a method may comprise providing a lightweight settable composition; introducing the lightweight settable composition into the portion of the gravel pack or the portion of the subterranean formation; and allowing the lightweight settable composition to form a hardened mass in the portion. The portions of the subterranean formation may include permeable portions of the formation and fractures (natural or otherwise) in the formation and other portions of the formation, that may allow the undesired flow of fluid into, or from, the well bore. The portions of the gra vel pack, include those portions of the gra vel pack, wherein it is desired to prevent the undesired How of fluids into, or from, the well bore. Among other things, this method may allow the sealing of the portion of the gravel pack to prevent the undesired How of fluids without requiring the gravel pack's removal, [0042] Another example of a method of the present invention is a method of sealing voids located in a pipe string (e.g., easing, expandable casings, liners, etc,) or in a cement sheath. Generally, the pipe string will be disposed in. a well bore, and the cement sheath may be located in the annulus between the pipe string disposed in the well bore and a wall of the well bore. An example of such a method may comprise providing a. lightweight settable composition.; introducing the lightweight settable composition into the void; and allowing the lightweight settable composition to set to form a hardened mass in the void. [0043] When, sealing a void in a pipe string, the methods of the present invention, in some embodiments, further may comprise locating the void in the pipe string; and isolating the void by defining a space within the pipe string in communication with the void; wherein the lightweight settable composition may be introduced into the void from the space. The void may be isolated using any suitable technique and/or apparatus, including bridge plugs, packers, and the like. The void in the pipe string may be located using any suitable technique. [0044] When sealing a void in the cement sheath, the methods of the present invention, in some embodiments, further may comprise locating the void in the cement sheath: producing a perforation in the pipe string that intersects the void; and Isolating the void by defining a space within the pipe string in communication with the void via the perforation, wherein the lightweight settable composition is introduced into the void via the perforation. The void in the pipe string may be located using any suitable technique, The perforation may be created in the pipe string using any suitable technique, for example, perforating guns. The void may be isolated using any suitable technique and/or apparatus, including bridge plugs, packers, and the like. [0045] In some embodiments, die lightweight settable compositions may set to have a desirable compressive strength for remedial cementing operations, Compressive strength is generally the capacity of a material or structure to withstand axially directed pushing forces. The compressive strength may be measured at a specified time after the settable compositions have been positioned and the settable compositions are maintained under specified temperature and pressure conditions. Compressive strength can be measured by either a destructive method or non-destructive method. The destructive method physically tests the strength of treatment fluid samples at various points in time by crushing the samples in a compression-testing machine. The compressive strength is calculated from the failure load divided by the cross-sectional area resisting the load and is reported in units of poundforce per square inch. (psi). Non-destructive methods typically may employ an Ultrasonic Cement Analyzer (‘TJCA”), available from Farm Instrument Company, Houston, ΤΧ, Compressive strengths may be determined in accordance with API RP 106-2,Recommended Practice for Testing Well Cements, First Edition, July 2005, [0046] By way of example, the lightweight settable compositions, may develop a 24-hour compressive strength- after mixing of the dry blend with the water in the range of from about 100 psi to about 165 psi, alternatively, from about $0 psi to about 165 psi, or alternatively from about 100 psi to about 600 psi In some embodiments, the lightweight settable composition may develop a compressive strength in 24 hours of at least about 20 psi, at least about i 00 psi, at least about 500 psi, or more, [0047] The exemplary lightweight settable compositions disclosed herein may directly or indirectly affect one or more components or pieces of equipment associated with the preparation, delivery, recapture, recycling, reuse, and/or disposal of the disclosed settable compositions.
