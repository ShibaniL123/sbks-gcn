Technical Field of the Invention The present application relates to polymer/clay nanocomposite materials, more particularly, to nanocomposite materials based on a copolymer of at least two monomers selected from the group consisting of butadiene, isoprene and styrene and a clay mineral, and a process for preparing them. Background of the Invention Polymer nanocomposite materials are substantially different from conventional composite materials(wherein the dispersed phase is in a size of microns) in mechanical properties and functionalization ability, due to a high fineness and a nano-scaled effect of the dispersed phase. Among them, layered silicate/polymer nanocomposite materials exhibit much more pronounced or specific properties, such as high rigidity, high strength, high barrier property, high flame retardancy, high chemical resistance, due to a high shape factor of the dispersed phase(laminar layers of layered silicate crystals). For layered silicate/polymer nanocomposite materials, there are generally three preparation processes: in-situ intercalation polymerization of polymerizable monomers, prepolymer intercalation and polymer intercalation. In the prepolymer intercalation process, a sufficient amount of prepolymers must be intercalated between the layers of organoclays, just like monomers, and however, since the prepolymers are obviously more viscous than the monomers, not only the expansion ability of the organoclays by the prepolymers, but also the reactivity and reaction rate are reduced. Therefore, the difficulties of such a process lie in decreasing the viscosity of the prepolymers and increasing the compatibility or the reactivity between the prepolymers and the organoclays. In the polymer intercalation process, the polymers in the form of melt or solution are directly intercalated between the layers of organically modified silicates, which is driven by the physical or chemical interactions between the polymers and the organically modified silicates, thereby forming layered silicate/polymer nanocomposite materials. In order to improve the compatibility between the polymers and the organoclays, appropriate compatibilizers are often introduced, and the compatibilizers to be introduced are required to have a relatively strong interaction with the intercalating agents or have an enough long non-polar portion to not only provide a steric hindrance, enlarge the interlayer distance and reduce the interlayer attractions, but also improve the compatibility with the polymer matrix. However, the compatibilizers will deteriorate the properties of the resultant materials when used in a relatively large amount. In the in-situ intercalation polymerization of monomers, organoclays are directly added to the monomers so as to be swollen therein and then the monomers are in-situ polymerized in and around the interlayer spaces, with the interlayer distance being gradually enlarged as the reaction progresses and finally the organoclays being uniformly dispersed in the resultant polymers in single layers, thereby forming organoclay/polymer nanocomposite materials. In the nanocomposite materials thus obtained, there are a relatively strong interaction and a better compatibility between the organoclays and the polymers, the organoclays are uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix, a delaminated structure can be easily formed and thus the organoclays exert a pronouncedly reinforcing effect on the polymer matrix. It thus can be seen that the in-situ intercalation polymerization of monomers is most ideal and effective for compounding polymers and organoclays. US Patent No. 4,889,885 discloses two processes for preparing clay/rubber nanocomposite materials. One is the in-situ intercalation polymerization in which the laminar layers of the clay mineral are firstly modified with quaternary ammonium salts having a terminal vinyl group, the resultant organoclay is then dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide solvent, isoprene and a corresponding amount of free radical initiator are added into the resultant dispersion, then isoprene is polymerized in the interlayer spaces of the clay to form an polyisoprene rubber, and finally the solvent is removed to obtain a clay/polyisoprene rubber nanocomposite material. In the other of said processes, a liquid amino-terminated nitrile rubber having a lower molecular weight is dispersed in a mixed solvent composed of water and dimethyl sulfoxide and to the resultant dispersion is added an acid to quaternize the terminal amino group, followed by mixing with an aqueous clay suspension, and finally water and the solvent are removed to form a clay/liquid nitrile rubber nanocomposite material. In the process disclosed in International Patent Application WO 97/00910, a clay mineral is firstly dispersed in water and is very fast and uniformly stratified due to the hydration of the interlayer cations, then to the resultant dispersion are added (a) momoner(s), an initiator, an emulsifier and finally the resultant mixture is emulsion polymerized in the aqueous dispersion of laminar layers of clay crystals, thereby forming clay/rubber nanocomposite materials. Due to the restrictions on the particle diameter and the micellar size of the emulsion, the dispersibility of the clay mineral in said process is inferior, the stratification is caused only by an interfacial physical interaction and the reaction is too complicated to be easily controlled and industrialized. Chinese Patent No. ZL98101496.8 discloses a macromolecular emulsion intercalation process, wherein a clay mineral is firstly dispersed in water in a lower proportion, then to the resultant dispersion is added a rubber latex, with the macromolecular latex particles penetrating and separating the laminar layers of the clay mineral and a smaller diameter of latex particles resulting in a better dispersing effect, to the resultant mixture is added a co-coagulating agent so as to co-precipitate the whole system and finally water is removed to obtain a rubber/clay composite material. By means of such a process, composite materials such as clay/SBR, clay/NBR, clay/XNBR, clay/NR, clay/CR are successfully prepared. In order to improve the interfacial interaction, multifunctional coupling molecules can be added to this system. Said process is based on the fact that most rubbers can be provided in a form of emulsion and thus is simple, easily controllable and involve low costs. Such a process is disadvantageous in that in the case of a high clay content, the dispersibility of the clay mineral is inferior to that in the reactive intercalation process and a larger amount of waste water is produced. Summary of the Invention In view of the above situations, the present inventors made extensive investigations in the field of polymer/clay nanocomposite materials and as a result, it is found that a class of copolymer/clay nanocomposite materials based on a copolymer of at least two monomers selected from the group consisting of butadiene, isoprene and styrene and a clay mineral can be prepared by subjecting said monomers to an in-situ intercalation polymerization in the presence of an organoclay by using an organolithium as the initiator, an organic hydrocarbon solvent as the solvent and a polar additive as the microstructure modifier by means of a classical anionic solution polymerization process, instead of the free radical polymerization process and the emulsion polymerization process as mentioned above, thereby forming elastomers reinforced in a nano-scale and effectively enhancing the comprehensive properties of the polymer products. Meanwhile, compared to the free radical polymerization process and the emulsion polymerization process as mentioned above, the present invention is advantageous in that by means of the anionic solution polymerization process with an alkyllithium as the initiator, the microstructures and the molecular parameters of the copolymers based on at least two monomers selected from the group consisting of butadiene, isoprene and styrene can be easily adjusted, so as to prepare a series of copolymer/clay nanocomposite materials. An object of the present invention is to provide a copolymer/clay nanocomposite material based on a copolymer of at least two monomers selected from the group consiting of butadiene, isoprene and styrene and a clay mineral, which is of a delaminated structure, is excellent in mechanical properties, heat resistance, barrier property, chemical resistance and is well balanced in its comprehensive properties. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the copolymer/clay nanocomposite material according to the present invention, wherein at least two monomers selected from the group consisting of butadiene, isoprene and styrene are subjected to in-situ intercalation polymerization in the presence of an organoclay by means of the lithium-based initiator. Due to the high fineness and the nano-scaled effect of the dispersed phase in the polymer/clay nanocomposite material according to the present invention, the mechnical properties and the functionalization ability of conventional composite materials can be improved and the resultant products have pronounced characteristics, such as high rigidity, high strength, high barrier property, high flame retardance, high chemical resistance. Compared to the copolymers prepared by the free radical polymerization process and the emulsion polymerization as mentioned above, the copolymers based on at least two monomers selected from the group consisting of butadiene, isoprene and styrene, prepared by using an organolithium as the initiator by means of the anionic solution polymerization process, have obviously different characteristics such as microstructures. These and other objections, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description of the present application with reference to the accompanied drawings.

If the content of said clay mineral is less than 0.5 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of said copolymer, the reinforcing effect of said clay mineral is insufficient; and if the content of said clay mineral is higher than 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of said copolymer, the resultant material is in the form of powders and thus is difficult to handle and shape.

When the nanocomposite material according to the present invention comprises a copolymer of butadiene and isoprene, the content of the structural units derived from isoprene is generally from 10'to 90% by weight, preferably from 30 to 70% by weight, and correspondingly, the content of the structural units derived from butadiene is generally from 10 to 90% by weight, preferably from 30 to 70% by weight. The nanocomposite material according to the present invention is of a delaminated structure, wherein the laminar layers of clay minerals are delaminated from each other, completely separated from each other and uniformly dispersed in the copolymer matrix in a disordered state. The present invention also provides a process for preparing the copolymer/clay nanocomposite material according to the present invention, comprising charging a reactor with an organic hydrocarbon solvent, at least two monomers selected from the group consisting of butadiene, isoprene and styrene, optional polar additives and an organoclay mineral dispersed in a dispersing medium; stirring uniformly to form a stable monomers/organoclay dispersion; then raising the temperature of the reaction system to 30 to 80°C; initiating the polymerization reaction by adding an organolithium initiator; after the complete polymerization of all monomers, terminating the reaction and optionally adding a conventional additive; working up the resultant polymer solution by a conventional manner and then drying. In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, the copolymer/clay nanocomposite material according to the present invention can be prepared by a process comprising: 1. providing a dispersion of an organoclay, containing from 1 to 10g of the organoclay per 100ml of dispersing medium;2. adding at least two monomers selected from the group consisting of butadiene, isoprene and styrene in an organic hydrocarbon solvent to a reactor, followed by the addition of the dispersion of the organoclay and optional polar additive for adjusting the microstructures of the resultant copolymer, then stirring the resultant mixture so as to render it uniform and form a stable monomers/organoclay dispersion, and after reaching an initiation temperature of 30 to 80°C, initiating the polymerization reaction by adding an organolithium initiator;3. after the complete polymerization of all monomers, adding a terminator to terminate the polymerization and then optionally adding a conventional additive, working up the resultant polymer solution by a conventional manner and then drying. In the process for preparing the copolymer/clay nanocomposite material according to the present invention, the order for adding the organic hydrocarbon solvent, monomers, optional polar additive and the organoclay dispersed in a dispersing medium is not important, and they can be added sequentially or simultaneously. The amount of the organoclay is such that the resultant copolymer/clay nanocomposite material comprises from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of said copolymer. The organoclay used in the present invention may be any commercial intercalated clay minerals, for example from Zhejiang Fenghong Clay Chemicals Co., Ltd., which is a nano-scaled montmorillonite(fine powders).
