BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic side view of an exemplary wear-resistant article 100 according to the present disclosure. It should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art, which fall within the scope and spirit of the principles of the disclosure. The FIGURE may not be drawn to scale. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The initial composition comprises silica nanoparticles dispersed in an aqueous liquid medium, wherein the silica nanoparticles have a particle size distribution with an average particle size of less than or equal to 20 nanometers, and wherein the initial composition has a pH greater than 6. The silica nanoparticles have an average particle size of less than or equal to 20 nanometers (nm). In some embodiments, the silica nanoparticles have an average particle size of less than or equal to 20 nm, less than or equal to 15 nm, less than or equal to 10 nm, less than or equal to 8 nm, or even less than or equal to 4. Typically, the silica nanoparticles have an average particle size of at least 4 nm, although this is not a requirement. The average primary particle size may be determined, for example, using transmission electron microscopy. As used herein, the term “particle size” refers to the longest dimension of a particle, which is the diameter for a spherical particle. Of course, silica particles with a particle size greater than 200 nm (e.g., up to 2 micrometers in particle size) may also be included, but typically in a minor amount. The silica nanoparticles desirably have narrow particle size distributions; for example, a polydispersity of 2.0 or less, or even 1.5 or less. In some embodiments, the silica nanoparticles have a surface area greater than 150 square meters per gram (m2/g), greater than 200 m2/g, or even greater than 400 m2/g. In some embodiments, the total weight of the silica nanoparticles in the initial composition is at least 0.1 percent by weight, typically at least 1 percent by weight, and more typically at least 2 percent by weight. In some embodiments, the total weight of the silica nanoparticles in the composition is no greater than 40 percent by weight, preferably no greater than 10 percent by weight, and more typically no greater than 7 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the initial composition. The silica nanoparticles may have a polymodal particle size distribution. Nanoparticles (e.g., silica nanoparticles) included in the initial composition can be spherical or non-spherical with any desired aspect ratio. Aspect ratio refers to the ratio of the average longest dimension of the nanoparticles to their average shortest dimension. The aspect ratio of non-spherical nanoparticles is often at least 2:1, at least 3:1, at least 5:1, or at least 10:1. Non-spherical nanoparticles may, for example, have the shape of rods, ellipsoids, and/or needles. The shape of the nanoparticles can be regular or irregular. The porosity of coatings can typically be varied by changing the amount of regular and irregular-shaped nanoparticles in the coatable composition and/or by changing the amount of spherical and non-spherical nanoparticles in the coatable composition. In some embodiments, the total weight of the silica nanoparticles in the initial composition is at least 0.1 percent by weight, typically at least 1 percent by weight, and more typically at least 2 percent by weight. In some embodiments, the total weight of the silica nanoparticles in the composition is no greater than 40 percent by weight, desirably no greater than 10 percent by weight, and more typically no greater than 7 percent by weight. Silica sols, which are stable dispersions of silica nanoparticles in aqueous liquid media, are well-known in the art and available commercially. Non-aqueous silica sols (also called silica organosols) may also be used and are silica sol dispersions wherein the liquid phase is an organic solvent, or an aqueous mixture containing an organic solvent. In the practice of this disclosure, the silica sol is chosen so that its liquid phase is compatible with the dispersion, and is typically an aqueous solvent, optionally including an organic solvent. Typically, the initial composition does not include, or is essentially free of, fumed silica, although this is not a requirement. Silica nanoparticle dispersions (e.g., silica sols) in water or water-alcohol solutions are available commercially, for example, under such trade names as LUDOX (marketed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, Del.), NYACOL (marketed by Nyacol Co., Ashland, Mass.), and NALCO (manufactured by Ondea Nalco Chemical Co., Oak Brook, Ill.). One useful silica sol is NALCO 2326, which is available as a silica sol with an average particle size of 5 nanometers, pH=10.5, and solid content 15 percent solids by weight. Other commercially available silica nanoparticles include those available under the trade designations NALCO 1115 (spherical, average particle size of 4 nm, 15 percent solids by weight dispersion, pH=10.4), NALCO 1130 spherical dispersion, average particle size of 8 nm, 30 percent solids by weight dispersion, pH=10.2), NALCO 1050 (spherical, average particle size 20 nm, 50 percent solids by weight dispersion, pH=9.0), NALCO 2327 (spherical, average particle size of 20 nm, 40 percent solids by weight dispersion, pH=9.3), NALCO 1030 (spherical, average particle size of 13 nm, 30 percent solids by weight dispersion, pH=10.2). Acicular silica nanoparticles may also be used provided that the average silica nanoparticle size constraints described hereinabove are achieved. Useful acicular silica nanoparticles may be obtained as an aqueous suspension under the trade name SNOWTEX-UP by Nissan Chemical Industries (Tokyo, Japan). The mixture consists of 20-21% (w/w) of acicular silica, less than 0.35% (w/w) of Na2O, and water. The particles are about 9 to 15 nanometers in diameter and have lengths of 40 to 200 nanometers. The suspension has a viscosity of <100 mPa at 25° C., a pH of about 9 to 10.5, and a specific gravity of about 1.13 at 20° C. Other useful acicular silica nanoparticles may be obtained as an aqueous suspension under the trade name SNOWTEX-PS-S and SNOWTEX-PS-M by Nissan Chemical Industries, having a morphology of a string of pearls. The mixture consists of 20-21% (w/w) of silica, less than 0.2% (w/w) of Na2O, and water. The SNOWTEX-PS-M particles are about 18 to 25 nanometers in diameter and have lengths of 80 to 150 nanometers. The particle size is 80 to 150 by dynamic light scattering methods. The suspension has a viscosity of <100 mPas at 25° C., a pH of about 9 to 10.5, and a specific gravity of about 1.13 at 20° C. The SNOWTEX-PS-S has a particle diameter of 10-15 nm and a length of 80-120 nm. Low- and non-aqueous silica sols (also called silica organosols) may also be used and are silica sol dispersions wherein the liquid phase is an organic solvent, or an aqueous organic solvent. In the practice of the present disclosure, the silica nanoparticle sol is chosen so that its liquid phase is compatible with the intended coating composition, and is typically aqueous or a low-aqueous organic solvent. Silica sols having a pH of at least 8 can also be prepared according to the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,693 (Brekau et al.). Optionally, the initial composition can further include other nanoparticles, including, for example, nanoparticles comprising aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, tin oxide, antimony oxide, antimony-doped tin oxide, indium oxide, tin-doped indium oxide, or zinc oxide. The initial composition has a pH greater than 6, more typically greater than 7, more typically greater than 8, and even more typically greater than 9. In some embodiments, the initial composition is essentially free of non-volatile organic compounds. In some embodiments, the initial composition is essentially free of organic surfactants. The aqueous liquid medium of the initial composition may comprise (in addition to water) at least one volatile organic solvent. Examples of suitable volatile organic solvents include those volatile organic solvents that are miscible with water such as, e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and combinations thereof. However, for many applications, reduction or elimination of volatile organic compounds will be desirable, and advantageously the present disclosure may be practiced using initial compositions and/or coatable compositions that are essentially free of volatile organic solvent. The initial composition is acidified by addition of inorganic acid until it has a pH of less than or equal to 4, typically less than 3, or even less than 2 thereby providing the coatable composition. Useful inorganic acids (i.e., mineral acids) include, for example, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid, chloric acid, and combinations thereof. Typically, the inorganic acid is selected such that it has a pKa of less than or equal to two, less than one, or even less than zero, although this is not a requirement. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the present inventors believe that some agglomeration of the silica nanoparticles occurs as the pH falls, resulting in a dispersion comprising slightly agglomerated nanoparticles. At this stage, at least one metal compound may be combined with (e.g., dissolved in) the acidified composition thereby providing the coatable composition, generally with mixing. Combination of the various ingredients in the above compositions may be carried out using any suitable mixing technique. Examples include stirring, shaking, and otherwise agitating the composition during or after addition of all components of the composition. The metal compound (and any metal cations contained therein) may comprise a metal (or metal cation) in any of groups 2 through 15 (e.g., group 2, group 3, group 4, group 5, group 6, group 7, group 8, group 9, group 10, group 11, group 12, group 13, group 14, group 15, and combinations thereof) of the Periodic Table of the Elements. Metal cations contained in the metal compound(s) may have a charge of n+, wherein n represents an integer ≧2 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), for example. The metal compounds should have sufficient solubility in water to achieve the desired level of metal incorporation in the resultant wear-resistant composition. For example, the metal compound(s) may comprise metal compound(s). Examples of useful metal compounds include copper compounds (e.g., CuCl2.2H2O), aluminum compounds (e.g., Al(NO3)3.9H2O), zirconium compounds (e.g., ZrCl4 or ZrOCl2.8H2O), titanium compounds (e.g., TiOSO4.2H2O), zinc compounds (e.g. Zn(NO3)2.6H2O), iron compounds, tin compounds (e.g., SnCl4.5H2O or SnCl2), and combinations thereof. Coatable compositions according to the present disclosure may further comprise one or more optional additives such as, for example, colorant(s), surfactant(s), thickener(s), thixotrope(s), or leveling aid(s). Optional other ingredients In some embodiments, the coatable composition may comprise an added surfactant, however, the inventors have unexpected discovered that coatable compositions according to the present disclosure wet out at least some hydrophobic surfaces without added surfactant. The coatable composition may comprise from 30 to 99 percent by weight of silica, preferably from 60 to 97.5 percent by weight of silica, more preferably from 80 to 95 percent by weight of silica, although other amounts may also be used. Similarly, the coatable composition may comprise the metal cations in an amount of from 0.2 to 20 mole percent (desirably from 0.5 to 10 mole percent, more desirably from 2 to 5 mole percent) of the total combined moles of silicon and the metal cations (e.g., having a positive charge of at least 2) contained in the metal compound(s), although other amounts may also be used. Once made, the coating composition is typically stable over long periods of time, over a range of temperatures, although this is not a requirement. The coating composition may be coated onto a substrate and at least partially dried, typically substantially completely dried. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the present inventors believe that during the drying process, condensation processes lead to chemical bonding between the silica nanoparticles and/or agglomerates at points of contact to form a silica matrix. Metal cations may be individually incorporated into the silica matrix, resulting in an amorphous composition. The coatable composition can be contacted with a surface of a substrate and at least partially dried to form a wear-resistant coated article. Unexpectedly, the present inventors have discovered that coatable compositions according to the present disclosure can be contacted with a surface of a substrate and at least partially dried to provide a defect-free layer with unexpected wear-resistant properties, even without added metal cations. Suitable methods of drying the coatable composition include, for example, evaporation in air at about room temperature, ovens, heated air blowers, infrared heaters, and hot cans. Drying is typically carried out until the coatable composition is substantially completely dry, although this is not a requirement. Once contacted with the substrate and at least partially dried, the wear-resistant layer may be aged for a period of time such as for example, at least 1 hour (hr), at least 4 hrs, at least 8 hrs, at least 24 hrs, at least 72 hrs, at least 1 week, or even at least 2 weeks, during which time the wear-resistance of the wear-resistant layer may improve. Referring now to FIG. 1, wear-resistant article 100 comprises wear-resistant layer 110 disposed on surface 120 of substrate 130. Examples of suitable methods of contact the coatable composition with the surface of the substrate include roll coating, spray coating, gravure coating, dip coating, and curtain coating. Typically, the wear-resistant layer has a thickness in the range of from 0.02 to 100 microns, preferably 0.05 to 5 microns, although this is not a requirement. Typically, wear-resistant layers according to the present disclosure are at least substantially transparent, however this is not a requirement. Examples of suitable substrates include virtually any dimensionally-stable material. Examples include glass substrates (e.g., mirrors, windows, windshields, tables, lenses, and prisms), metal substrates, ceramic substrates, organic polymer substrates (e.g., molded polymer articles, automotive paints and clearcoats, polymer films, retroreflective sheeting, indoor signage, and outdoor signage), and fabric (e.g., upholstery fabric). In some embodiments, the substrate comprises at least one of glass or an organic polymer. In some embodiments, the organic polymer comprises at least one of a polyester (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate or polybutylene terephthalate), polycarbonate, allyldiglycol carbonate, acrylics (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)), polystyrene, polysulfone, polyether sulfone, homo-epoxy polymers, epoxy addition polymers with polydiamines and/or polydithiols, polyamides (e.g., nylon 6 and nylon 6,6), polyimides, polyolefins (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), olefinic copolymers (e.g., polyethylene copolymers), and cellulose esters (e.g., cellulose acetate and cellulose butyrate), and combinations thereof.

The diffractometer was fitted with variable incident beam slits and diffracted beam slits. The survey scan was conducted in a coupled continuous mode from 5 to 80 degrees (2θ) using a 0.04 degree step size and 1200 second dwell time. X-ray generator settings of 40 kV and 40 mA were employed. Examples 23-24 Examples 23-24 were prepared by coating metal-doped silica dispersions on soda-lime glass substrates (obtained from Brin Northwestern Glass Company, Minneapolis, Minn.) using a #6 wire-wound coating rod (nominal wet coating thickness=14 microns). The metal-doped colloidal silica dispersions were prepared by diluting NALCO 1115 silica sol to 10 weight percent solids with deionized water, acidifying the diluted silica sol with concentrated HNO3 to a pH of about 2-3—and then adding a desired amount of aqueous metal compound solutions (10 weight percent Cu(NO3)2.3H2O, Zn(NO3)2.6H2O). The type and amount of metal cations added to the coating compositions for Examples 22 and 23 are reported in Table 5. The coated samples were then dried at room temp and then further cured at 120° C. for 10 min. The final coated samples were optically clear and transparent. The powders for analysis were collected by scraping the coating off from glass substrates. The samples thus prepared were analyzed according to the TEST METHOD FOR X-RAY SCATTERING ANALYSIS described above and the results are reported in Table 5.
