PRIORITY CLAIM In accordance with 37 C.F.R. 1.76, a claim of priority is included in an Application Data Sheet filed concurrently herewith. Accordingly, the present invention claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/952,068, entitled “HINGED EXPANDABLE CORPECTOMY DEVICE”, filed Mar. 12, 2014. The contents of the above referenced application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention generally relates to improvements to vertebral implants and, more particularly, to a longitudinally expandable vertebral implant including telescoping sections configured for incremental expansion by a ratchet expander for ease of securement at any desired increment in situ. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The spine consists of vertebrae that are categorized into sections known as the cervical, thoracic and lumbar section in a flexible arranged column. The vertebrae are separated by small cartilaginous cushions known as intervertebral discs. Intervertebral discs are oblate spherical structures that maintain the space between adjacent vertebrae. Each intervertebral disc consists of an outer annulus fibrosus, which surrounds the inner nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus consists of several layers of strong annular fibrocartilage to contain the nucleus pulposus and distribute pressure evenly across the disc wherein a mucoprotein gel serves to absorb shocks. Deterioration of an intervertebral disc results in limited mobility and can cause severe pain. For instance, normal aging causes the nucleus pulposus to lose fluid and contract in volume resulting in a reduction in the intervertebral space. Any reduction of space between adjacent vertebrae may put pressure on the nerves of the spinal column. Further, a reduction in volume of the nucleus pulposus reduces the disc's ability to absorb shock which can result in disc herniation. The bulge of a herniated disc may also put pressure on nearby nerve structures resulting in pain as well as diminished range of motion. Surgical options are available including laminectomy and discectomy combined with vertebral fusion and/or dynamic stabilization. However, these surgical options are highly invasive and require prolonged hospitalization and recovery. More recently, artificial disc replacement prosthetics have been used to replace or augment all or part of the removed or resected intervertebral disc. In order to reduce the pain associated with the movement of the intervertebral joint, surgical intervention is often indicated as a means to alleviate pressure upon the spinal cord while concomitantly stabilizing the associated vertebrae. This involves a surgical procedure to distract the disc and or vertebra, or portions thereof, and the insertion of bone fusing material into the cavity of the opposing vertebra. Corpectomy devices have been developed to help support the spine and maintain the normal spacing between opposing vertebrae. Some of these devices may be packed with fusing material to ensure solid bone growth between the two vertebrae. Typically, corpectomy devices are manufactured at various heights requiring that a cavity between opposing vertebrae to be distracted to a dimension corresponding to the sized corpectomy device. The surgical procedure to prepare the implant site can be difficult and lengthy. Moreover, the procedure can increase risk of trauma to the tissues surrounding of the implant site. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a longitudinally adjustable corpectomy device which fits within the intervertebral distracted channel. The device includes a means for engaging an extendable member to accommodate the distracted channel. An expanding member moves in relation to a main body in accordance with a hinged operation. An objective of the instant invention to provide a corpectomy device that may be adjusted within the intervertebral cavity or adjusted in situ within the cavity. It is a further objective of the instant invention to provide an expandable corpectomy which can be expanded by use of a hinged mechanism. Yet another objective of the instant invention is to provide vertebra engagable endplates which are arranged to pivot and self adjust. Other objectives and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with any accompanying drawings wherein are set forth, by way of illustration and example, certain embodiments of this invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described a presently preferred, albeit not limiting, embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the present invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated. Referring now to the Figures, set forth is a hinged, expandable corpectomy implant device, referred to generally as 10. The corpectomy implant device 10 is defined by a main body 12, a first expandable plate 14, and an opposing second expandable plate 16. Each expandable plate 14 and 16 is adapted to fit within the main body 12 in a non-expanded state, see FIG. 1. Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, in an expanded state, each expandable plate 14 and 16 moves a distance from the main body 12. The expandable plate 14 contains an upper surface 18 which can be smooth. In a preferred embodiment, the upper surface 18 contains surface configurations, such as ridges or teeth 20. The teeth 20 are sized, shaped, and orientated to grip and secure to a surface, such as a vertebral bone. A side wall 22 extends away form the upper surface 18 and is set back to allow for at least a portion of the upper surface 18 to overhang. The first expandable plate upper side wall 22 is inserted into the main body 12 so that in the non-expanded position, the upper surface lies flush with the top end 24 of the main body 12. Two slotted regions 26 and 28 are sized to receive an expansion member to be described later. The second expandable plate 16 contains an upper surface 30 which can be smooth. In a preferred embodiment, the upper surface 30 contains surface configurations, such as ridges or teeth 32. The teeth 32 are sized, shaped, and orientated to grip and secure to a surface, such as a vertebral bone. A side wall 34 extends away form the upper surface 30 and is set back to allow for at least a portion of the second expandable plate upper surface to overhang. The second expandable plate upper wall side wall 34 is inserted into the main body 12 so that in the non-expanded position, a portion of the second expandable plate 16 lies flush with the bottom end 36 of the main body 12. Two slotted regions 38 and 40 are sized to receive an expansion member to be described later. To provide for the expandable plates 14 and 16 to traverse between an expanded position and non-expanded position, the corpectomy implant device 10 comprises an expansion member 42, illustrated as a toggle. The expansion member 42 is defined by a screw 44 operatively coupled to a plurality of pivotably connected to a pair of expansion member plates 46 and 48. The screw head 50 is shaped to receive a rotation generating device, such as a drill bit or other driving tool, such as a screw driver, to provide the necessary rotational force to move the expansion member plates 46 and 48 relative to each other. In use, as the screw 44 is rotated, the expansion member plate 46 and the expansion member plate 48 pivot about hinge 52 from a first position in which the expansion member plates 46 and 48 from a generally V shaped orientation to an expandable state in which the expansion member plates 46 and 48 form a linear structure. Depending on the degree of expansion required, the expansion member plates 46 and 48 may assume a position in-between the non-expanded state and the fully expanded state. The expansion member 42 is designed so that the degree of expansion when the expansion member plates 46 and 48 are in the non-expansion state is greatest. As such, during the first few rotations, the degree of member plate separation is greatest. As the expansion member plates 46 and 48 reach their most distal heights, i.e. formation of a liner structure, plate separation is more difficult. Such feature allows the surgeon the capability to make fine adjustments at this point. Positioned at the distal end of each expansion member plate 46 and 48 are generally cylindrical bars 54 and 56. The cylindrical bar 54 is sized and shaped to slidably engage slotted region 28. The cylindrical bar 56 is sized and shaped to slidably engage slotted region 38. As such, when screw 44 is engaged and rotates causing each expansion member plate 46 and 48 to pivot about hinge 52, bar 54 slides within slotted region 28. As the bar contacts the closed end 58, the first expandable plate 14 moves. Concurrently, as bar 56 slides within slotted region 38 and contacts closed end 60, the second expandable plate 16 moves, causing overall expansion.
