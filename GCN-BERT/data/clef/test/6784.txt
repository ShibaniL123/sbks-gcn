l0 2U This invention relates to the polymerization of vinyl acetate and relates more particularly to the pïoductlon of aqueous emulsions of polyvinyl acetate. It is an object of this invention to provide a novel aqueous emulsion of polyvinyl acetate, and a novel process for the preparation of such emulsions. Another object of this invention is the provision of a new aqueous emulsion of polyvinyl acetate of fine particle size that may be mixed with relatively large counts of pigments to produce a stable paint. furrier object of this invention is to provide an aqueous emulsion of polyvinyl acetate that may be mixed with pigments to provide paint films of improved scrubresistance. Other objects of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and claims. In accordance with one aspect of this invention, aqueous emulsions of vinyl acetate polymers are produced by the polymerization of vinyl acetate in aqueous mulsion in ue presence of decahydronaphthalene. Advantageously a small amount of the dec ahydronaphthalene is added to the monomeric vinyl acetate and the resulting mixture is polymerized by adding it gradually to an aqueous medium containing a dispersing agent, while sald aqueous medium is maintained at an I 6 83672 J±evated temperature, a polymerization catalyst being present during the polymerization reaction. However, the decahydrenaphthalene may be added separately to the aqueous medium, before or during the polymerization reaction, if desired. Suitable proportions of decahydronaphthalene are about 0.2 to 10%, preferably 0.5 to 4%, based on the weight of the vinyl acetate. According to another aspect of this invention emulsions of vinyl acetate polymers are prepared by polymeriI0 nation in the presence of a small amount, e.g. 0.01% te 0.1%, of a chelating and sequestering agent containing amino and carboxylic acid groups, such as for example, iminotriacetîo acid or its alkali metal salts r ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid or its alkali metal salts. Especially good results have been obtained by the use of the trisodîum sali of ethylene diamine tetraacetioE acid. It is found that when these agents are added the reaction proceeds in such a manner that the content of residual monomer in the polymerized product is lower than when such agents are absent, all other conditions being the same. This effect is particularly marked when commercial vinyl acetate containing a minor amount of a polymerization inhibitor, such as hydroquinone, is employed. The chelating and sequestering agents used in the practice of this invention are stable indefinitely in the polymer emulsion or paint, undergoing no reversion, hydrolysais or decomposition. They are not colloidal, do not precipitate proteins which may be present in the emulsion, are compatible wi h cationic agents which may be added, do not thin out clays or starches and exert a dispersing action on titanium dioxide and other inorganic materials such as manganese dioxide. • • • i•• i ii ••• ip,ï•• •••i ..... •kl ï ï• ii ï k • • iïi!i ! • • i¸ •¸• •III! I i!ï •i 3.O In one preferred form of this invention the monomeric vinyl acetate is added to the aqueous medium containing the dispersing agent at such a rate that throughout substantially the thole of the polymerization reaction the concentration of monomer is relatively low, i.e. not over about 25 parts of monomer» preferably not above parts of monomer, for each lO0 parts of water. Advantageously» the monomer is added at a rate substantially equal to the rate of polymerization thereof in said aqueous medium« Th monomer is added until the concentration of polyvinyl acetate in the aqueous medium has increased to the desired value, preferably until the polyvinyl acetate content of the resulting emulsion is about 50 to 60%. The ìolymerîzation reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a catalyst, preferably a peroxide catalyst, Examples of suitable peroxide catalysts are potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate hydrogen peroxide» and such combinations as mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and an iron salt! hydrogen peroxide and zinc formaldehyde sulfoxylate or other similar reducing àgentJ hydrogen peroxide and a tltanous salt potassium persulfate and sodium blsulfltej a bromate mixed with a blsulfitej and other redox catalyst systems. In general an amount of peroxide catalyst sufficient to supply O.OO1 to 0.i part of available oxygen per i00 parts of monomer is suitable« The dispersing agent employed in the practice of this invention is preferably a mixture of 1 to I0 parts of a hydrophilic colloid and O.01 to 2 parts of a surface tension depressant per 100 parts of, water. Examples of suitable hydrophilîc colloids are water-soluble polyvinyl alcohols, including substantially fully hydrolyzed and partially hydrolysed polyvinyl acetates, gum arabic» hydrox jethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, carbox nethyl cellulose, soluble starch, glue, gelatine, sodium alginate and agar. Examples of suitable surface tension depressants are the known anionic» cationic and non-lonic wetting agents. Among the anionic agents which may be used are the higher molecular relight sulfonlo acids and salts thereof e«g. aoEkyl aryl sulfonates such as Isobutyl» diisobutyl or keryl naphthalene sulfonic acids or their sodium salts» sodium lauryl sulfate» sodium salt of dloctyl sulfosuccinate» and f0rmaldehyde-naphthalene sulfonic acid condensation products. Examples of suitable non-lonlc surface tension depressants are the polyglycol ethers, esters and amides obtained by the reaction of ethylene oxide or higher polyethylene glycols with higher fatty acids» alcohols or amides« A mixture of a hydropbillc colloid and a cyclic alcohol» e.g. a sterol such as cholesterol, is also suitable as the dispersing agent« The polymerization Of the vinyl acetate iS advantageously carried out at a pH of about 3 to g» preferably 4 o V The pli may be controlled by the use of mild acids or i bases» such as formic acid, sodium bicarbonàte1 sodium acetate sodium phosphate, or mixtures thereof. The temperature of polymerization may be varied c considerable Temperatures of about 50 to 95°C. are preferred» The polymerization reaction may be carried out under atmospheric» subatmospheric or superatmospher$c pressure. Conveniently, the reaction is carried out in a substantially oxygen-free atmosphere by operating in a closed reactor equipped with a reflux condenser, which prevents the vinyl acetate monomer» 6 83672 t0 the most volatile constituent of the reaction mixture, from leaving the reactor and serves to maintain an atmosphere of vinyl acetate vapor above the liquid aqueous reaction medium. The reaction may be carried out in an atmosphere of an inert gas» e.g. by passing a stream of nitrogen or carbon dioxide through the reaction mixture. The process of this invention finds its greatest utility in the manufacture of homopolymers of vinyl acetate. However, it may also be employed for the copolymerization of mixture of vinyl acetate and minor amounts of other ethylenically unsaturated copolymerizable monomers such as the alkyl acrylates and methacrylates, e.g. methyl acrylate or methyl methacrylate; other vinyl esters such as vinyl buryrate or vinyl chloride; crotonlc esters» e.g. ethyl crotonate; dlaikyl maleates such as dimethyl maleate; acrylic, methacrylic or crotonlc acids; acrylamide and N-alkyl or N N dlalkyl acrylsmides; methyl Vinyl sulfone; vinyl benzene sulfonic acid or salts thereof; vinyl benzene sulfonamidej sodium oriother salt of vinyl-sulfonic acid; esters of vinyle-sulfonic acid such as the ethyl ester; nitriles such as acrylonitrîle or fumaronltrile; malefic anhydride; N-vlnyl pyrrolldone; and similar compounds. The polyvinyl acetate emulsions produced in accordance with this invention are generally of fine particle size» i.e. the polymer particles therein have diameters of 2 microns or less» e.g. 0.3 te 1.2 microns. They may be mixed with pla ticlzers and pigments te produce paints of excellent properties. Comparisons between paints made with the known polyvinyl acetate emulsions and paints made with the decahydronaphthalene-contalnlng polyvinyl acetate emulsions of this invention show that the emulsions of this invention ,. - ;Ç u :. U ;y ,- tolerate larger volumes of pigment and that paints made ith the emulsions of this invention are less sensitive to mechanical agitation and are much more resistant to scrubbing Examples of pigments which may be employed for producing paints in accordance with this Invention are titanium dioxide such as that known as "Titanox RA-50"j llthopone such as that known as "Alballth 14" antimony oxide; barytes; diatomaceous silica, e.g. "Celite 281 talc sŒEch as "Nytal 300"; clay such as that sold under the name "ASP 400"; mica, for example 325 mesh waterground mica; red» yellow, black and brown iron oxides, a.g. "Zrox Red 1380" and "Mapîco Browne; maroon oxides; metallic browns; cadmium red; toluidine red; para red; lithos toner; cadmium yellow; hansa yellow; benzidine yellow; dinltraniline orange; chromium oxide green; phthalocyanlne green phthalocyanlne blue; lampblack; carbon black; mineral black; metallic flakeoe and powders (e.g. aluminum, copper)j and luminous pigments. The amount of pigment used may be varied widely» a suitable range being» fer example, an amount sufficient to prOVide a .pigment volume conca tration" of about 30 te 45% Pigment volume concentration (rabbreviated "P.V.C.") is defined in the ar as the volume of pigment divided by the sum of the volume of pigment and the volume of non-volatile vehicle in the paint« The B.V.C. may be varied depending on the type of pigment, degree of hiding desired and degree of flatness desired. The high tolerance for pigments of the polyvinyl acetate emulsions made in the presence of decahydronaphthalene in accordance with this invention makes it possible to use the cheaper extender types of pigments while still obtaining a paint of good hiding power and scrub resistance,. • !p ' i ........ i i i ' . lO Examples of plasticizers which may be used in the manufacture of the paint are monomeric ester plasticizers sotch as dibutylphthalate, or alkyd resin type polyesters, e.g. "Paraplex G25". "Paraplex G40,,t "Paraplex G60"t or "Resoflex R-296"; chlorinated diphenyls such as that sold under the name "Aroclor 1242," and extender type plasticizers such as the substituted biphenyls sold by Monsanto Chemical Company under the names B40" and " IB20". The amount of plasticizer it is preferred to use varies depending on the particular plasticizer chosen. Thus for such plasticizers as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate and trícresyl phosphate the preferred proportion is about lO to !15% based on the weight of polyvinyl acetate, while for dioctyl sebacate or dioctyl adipate it is about 8 to 10% and for the alkyd resinous type of plasticizer it is about 12 to 20%. Smaller proportions, or no plasticizer at all, should be employed with those copolymers of vinyl acetate which are internally plasticized by the presence of the copolymerized ethylenlcally unsaturated compound. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention further. EXAMPLE I 0'.96 parts by weight of the polyvinyl alcohol known as "Elvanol 51-05", 0.64 parts by weight of the lower molecular weight polyvinyl alcohol known as "Elvanol 50-4 (both "Elvanols" being hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates Whose extent of hydrolysis is 86 to 89%), 0.15 parts by weight of ,Aerosol 0T, (sodium sait of díoctyl sulfosuccinate), 0.05 par by weigh of potassium persulfate 0.033 parts by weight of sodium bicarbonate and 0.025 parts by weight of "Sequestrene 6 8367 2 NA3' (the trisodium salt of ethylene diamine tetracetic acid) are mixed with 44.1 parts of water to form a Solution. 53 parts by ",:elght of vinyl acetate are mixed with I part by weight of decahydronaphthalene and 5.1 parts by weight of the resulting mixture are added to the aforementioned aqueous solution, which is at a temperature of 60°C., in a reactor fitted vlth a stirrer and a reflux condenser. An exothermic pol> erlzation reaction takes place after a short induction period. The temperature of the resulting aqueous mixture is raised voile refluxing takes place and reaches 79,5°C« after 21 minutes. The remainder of the mixture of vinyl acetate and deca dronaphthalene is then added dropping with adequate stirring to the aqueous mixture over a period of ll9 minutes, while the temperature of t he aqueous mixture is maintained at 78-81°C., änd thereafter the whõle is heated to 9000. for 60 minutes to complete substantially the polymerization of the monomer. The resulting emulsion has a North Fineness eT 8, a viscosity (Brookfìeld» 20 RPM) of 6280 centlpolses, and a pE of 4«8. It is stable to freezing, withstanding more than five freeze-thaw cycles» and has a particle size of about 0.3 te 1.2 microns. EXAMPLE, I The polyvinyl acetate emulsion produced in Example I Is mixed with an aqueous plasticizer emulsion containing dlbutyl phthalateæ the amount of the plasticizer emulsion being sufficient to provide 15 parts of dibutyl phthalate per i00 parts of the "solids" (i.e. non-volatile materials) present in the polyvînyl acetate emulsion. The ìesulting mixture is formed into a film which is tested for scrub resistance. The film withstands I/+00 scrub cycles before IO it fails. When the sa e test is applied to an emulsion made in an otherwise identical manner, but without the decahydronaphthalene, the film withstands only 225 scrub cycles before it fails. In this example the aqueous plasticizer emulsion contains, by weight, 50% of dibutyl phthalate, 2 % of the emulsifying agent known as ',Triton XlO0,, 1% of concentrated aqueous ammonia and the balance water. The mixture of the polyvinyl acetate emulsion and the plastìclzer emulsion is laid down in the form of a film 0.006 inch thick on a ground glass plate and then ged I+8 hours, after which the coated plate is placed in Gardner Washability Machine (Model 105) where the surface o£ the coating is thoroughly wetted with a 1% aqueous solution of the detergent known as -Dreft,, and a uniformly weighted bristle brush is passed back and forth over the film. brushing is counted.
