DESCRIPTION Title of Invention ECTOPARASITE CONTROL AGENT Technical Field [0001] The present invention relates to an ectoparasite control agent having a reliable effect. Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2013-046259, filed March 8, 2013, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. Background Art [0002] Ectoparasites such as fleas, lice, flies, mosquitoes, ticks, and mites, and endoparasites such as digestive tract nematodes, trematodes, and heartworms are problematic to both humans and animals. Such parasites include an egg stage, a larval stage, a pupal stage, a nymph stage, and an adult stage, decrease the body weight increase of a host, cause low quality of leather, wool, and meat, cause death in some cases, and exert a serious influence on productivity in the domestic animal industry. In addition, ectoparasites and endoparasites spread disease through food or pets, and cause discomfort. In particular, it is known that ectoparasites cause infection by becoming the habitat for various microbial pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and parasitic protozoa. Many ectoparasites are pathogenic with respect to humans, and other homoiothermal mammals and birds. Examples of diseases in which ectoparasites are involved include malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and blood-borne filariasis, trachoma, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, babesiosis, and food-bome diseases caused by salmonella, Ε. cob, or Campylobacter, but the examples thereof are not limited thereto. [0003] An important point in medical care against parasite by parasite exterminating drugs is to promote the development of a reagent capable of suppressing the parasite. For example, usual methods for suppressing parasite by parasite exterminating drugs, in general, focus on the use of an agricultural pesticide, and these are unsuccessful or insufficient in many cases for at least one of the reasons described below. The reasons are (1) the owner or the applicator's compliance (frequent administration is required) failure, (2) behavior or physiological intolerance of an animal with respect to the exterminator product or the administration method, (3) expression of resistance of ectoparasites with respect to a reagent, or (4) a negative effect with respect to the environment and/or toxicity. [0004] Specifically, it is known or considered that ticks and fleas are parasitic on wild animals in the same manner as on domestic animals or humans, and are involved in mediating pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and parasitic protozoa. Currently, ticks are considered to be the second most common vectors of human diseases in the world after mosquitoes; however, in North America, ticks are considered to be the most serious pathogens. Since there is often a need to treat the environmental reservoir host together with the direct host at the same time, effective extermination against parasite by ectoparasites such as fleas in the domestic environment is difficult and unrealistic in many cases. Currently, suppression of ticks in the agricultural environment is performed by an overall harmful organism treatment method in which various suppression methods are adapted to one region or one type of tick, while sufficiently considering the environmental effect. [0005] Although the use of insecticides and exterminators is beneficial to suppress ectoparasites, improved compounds, formulations, and methods to replace the existing ones are needed. Desirable compounds, formulations, and methods will not only provide alternative treatments but also overcome at least some of the restrictions of current methods. Such restrictions include toxicity and safety to an animal, a user, or an owner, restrictions relating to the efficacy (potency, durability of activity, killing speed), and the problem of resistance (limited to this). In addition, affecting the beneficial use of insecticides and exterminators is hindrance of administration, and as such hindrance, the method, a user or an owner's compliance problem relating to the treatment recommendation, and repetition of administrations are exemplified. For example, excessively repeatedly treating animals is often troublesome and difficult for a user or an owner, and therefore, it is desirable to reduce the number of administrations while maintaining the efficacy. [0006] Specific examples of the 1-heterodiene compounds used in the ectoparasite control agent of the present invention are disclosed in PTLs 1 and 2.

Description of Embodiments [0024] Hereinafter, preferable examples of the present invention will be described, but the present invention is not limited to the examples. Additions, omissions, substitutions, and other modifications can be made to the configuration of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The ectoparasite control agent of the present invention contains at least one compound selected from the 1-heterodiene compounds (hereinafter, also referred to as the compound (1)) represented by Formula (I) and salts thereof as an effective component. First, the term "unsubstituted" in the present invention means that only a group which is a base skeleton is present. When only the name of a group which is a base skeleton is described without describing "have a substituent", it means "unsubstituted" unless specified otherwise. On the other hand, the term "have a substituent" means that any hydrogen atom of a group which is a base skeleton is substituted with a group having the same structure as or different from the base skeleton. Therefore, "a substituent" is another group which is bonded to a group which is a base skeleton. The substituent may be one, or two or more. Two or more substituents may be the same as or different from each other. The term "Cl-6" represents that the carbon atom number of a group which is a [0025] base skeleton is 1 to 6. The carbon atom number does not include the number of carbon atoms present in a substituent.

To securely promote the stability and delivery of effective components, an additional effective component and carrier may be included in a formulation containing at least one compound selected from the compounds of the present invention. The term "carrier" is used in the specification in order to describe optional raw materials other than the effective component in the formulation. The selection of the carrier widely depends on factors such as the specific method in the administration or application, the effect of the carrier on solubility and stability, and the properties of the dosage form. [0109] The ectoparasite control agent of the present invention can control parasites over a long period of time in a single administration even in a case where the dosage is low, by excellent durability of activity that the compounds of the present invention have. Specifically, it is possible to control about three weeks to about one month in a single administration. Therefore, the ectoparasite control agent of the present invention may be administered weekly, biweekly, monthly, or at a longer interval than those. That is, when the ectoparasite control agent of the present invention is administered to a host animal, in particular, a warm-blooded animal by a known veterinary method, in particular, topically, a long validity period can be expected. [0110] That is, the present invention further includes the following. (1) An ectoparasite control agent, which is administered topically monthly or at a longer interval than that, contains at least one compound selected from the 1-heterodiene compounds represented by Formula (I) and salts thereof as an effective component. (2) A method for controlling ectoparasites that are gathered in and on a warm-blooded animal, in which the ectoparasite control agent which contains at least one compound selected from the 1-heterodiene compounds represented by Formula (I) and salts thereof as an effective component is administered topically monthly or at a longer interval than that. (3) A method for suppressing parasites in the body or on the body surface of an animal requiring suppression of parasite by parasites, in which an effective amount of at least one compound selected from the 1-heterodiene compounds represented by Formula (I) and salts thereof is administered topically to the animal monthly or at a longer interval than that. (4) A topical use of at least one compound selected from the 1-heterodiene compounds represented by Formula (I) and salts thereof for suppressing parasite of ectoparasites monthly or at a longer interval than that. [0111] Since the compounds shown below among 1-heterodiene compounds represented by Formula (I) show excellent durability of activity, a long validity period can be expected. [0112] Larval immersion microassay can be performed as described in "J. Med. Entomol. 41: 1034 - 1042 (2004)". In brief, a test compound was mixed with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare a stock solution having a concentration of 10 mM. Then, a 10 mM sample solution was diluted with an aqueous solution containing 1% ethanol and 0.2% TritonX-100, per fraction using a 96-well microtiter plate to obtain 0.1 ml of a test compound having a desired concentration (in general, 0.3 mM or less) (dilution was repeated at least three times with respect to each compound or each concentration). About 30 to 50 larvae of a lone star mite (Amblyomma americanum) were immersed in each well containing the test compound. After immersing for 30 minutes, the larvae were taken out using a wide bore pipette tip having a capacity of 0.05 ml, put into commercially available tissue biopsy bags made of paper, of which the upper portions were sealed with dialysis clips made of plastic, separately, and air-dried for 60 minutes in a state of being upside down. Next, the bag containing the larvae was kept at a temperature of about 27 °C and a relative humidity of 90% or higher. After 24 hours, the bag was opened, and the surviving larvae and dead larvae were counted, and the mortality rate of the larvae was calculated. [0114] The following test compounds showed an activity of 80% or greater in the test using this assay, at a concentration of 100 μΜ or less. 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, 1-15, 1-16, 1-17, 1-18, 1-19, 1-20, 1-21, 1-22, 1-23, 1-24, 1-25, 1-28, 1-29, 1-30, 1-31, 1-33, 1-36, 1-38, 1-39, 1-42, 1-43, (Test Example 2) Acaricidal Test of Rodent (RAT) In Vivo Evaluation of the test compounds can be performed by a method obtained by modifying the analysis method described in "J. Med. Entomol. 43 (3) 526 - 532 (2006)". In the analysis method, other mite species (in references, described as a mite of Amblyomma americanum) can be also used, and, for example, other mite species such as a mite of Dermacentor variabilis can be also used. A mite-holding unit (which was configured of small size nipples, a crew cap with a vent, and a reinforcing rubber washer) was attached to the back of an adult Sprague-Dawley rat. After attaching the holding unit, 0.05 ml of a test compound dissolved in acetone was applied topically on the skin surface inside the holding unit. After leaving to stand for a sufficient period of time to evaporate the acetone, about 10 American dog mites (Dermacentor variabilis) in nymph stage, to which food was not given, were put into each holding unit. Three to five rats per treatment group were used. 48 hours after the treatment, the holding unit was removed, and the surviving mites and dead mites were counted. In the evaluation of efficacy, geometric mean calculation was used. First, the total number of surviving mites was converted by the natural logarithm transformation by adding 1 (Ln total number + 1). That is, by adding 1 to each total number, the total number which was zero was adjusted. The geometric mean (GM) of the total number of mites in a treatment group was obtained by inverse-transforming the mean transformation value of the total number of treatment groups and subtracting 1. The non-treated control group was used for comparison with the groups in which the test compound was given for calculation of efficacy % (reduction % in the number of surviving mites). By comparing the geometric mean (GM) of surviving mites which were observed in the treated rats with the GM number of surviving mites which were counted in negative control rats, the efficacy of the treatment was calculated using the following equation. [0116] Efficacy [%] = [(survival mites GM number of control - survival mites GM number of treatment groups) / (survival mites GM number of control) χ 100 [0117] The following test compounds showed an efficacy of 50% or greater in the test using the analysis method, at an effective component concentration of 1% or less (10 mg/ml). 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, 1-11, 1-12, 1-13, 1-14, 1-15, 1-16, 1-17, 1-18, 1-19, 1-20, 1-21, 1-22, 1-23, 1-25, 1-26, 1-27, 1-28, 1-29, 1-30, 1-31, 1-32, 1-33, 1-34, 1-35, 1-36, 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, 1-41, 1-42, 1-43, 1-44, 1-46, 1-52, 1-55, 1-57, 1-61, 1-62, 1-64, 1-69, 1-71, 1-72, and 2-1 The activity in the above analysis method shows that the compound of the present invention is useful for suppressing parasite of mites. [0118] (Test Example 3) Parasite extermination Test of Dog In Vivo Each type of the test compounds was applied to four dogs. One day before treatment (-1 day) of the test compound, about 50 adults of Rhipicephalus sanguineus to which food was not given, per dog, were parasitized. It was estimated that 50% of the 50 ticks were male and 50% of the 50 ticks were female. Separately, the tested compound was dissolved in a mixed solvent consisting of 80% by volume of benzyl alcohol and 20% by volume of isopropyl myristate such that the concentration became 50 mg/ml, whereby a test solution was prepared. On zeroth day, several different spots of the interscapular region were treated with the test solution by "topical spot-on" such that the test compound was treated per 20 mg/kg per body weight of a dog. For comparison, a negative control was also prepared. In order to evaluate the treatment against the parasitized ticks, survival of the ticks were observed on the 2nd day (48 hours after the treatment). To evaluate the durability, on the 5th, 12th, 19th, and 28th day, 50 ticks to which food was not given, per dog, were parasitized again. In addition, on the 12th and 28th day, 50 adult fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) to which food was not given were parasitized together. Furthermore, on the 33rd day, 50 adult American dog mites (Dermacentor variabilis) to which food was not given were parasitized. On the 7th, 14th, 21st, 30th and 35th day, 48 hours after each was parasitized, survival of the ticks and mites were observed, and the ticks and mites were removed from the dogs. The ticks were classified according to whether or not the ticks were attached, and the survival state was determined. In the evaluation of efficacy, the same geometric mean calculation as that in Test Example 2 was used. [0119] As the test compounds, 1-3, 1-5, 1-10, 1-28, 1-29, and 1-71 were used. Here, the test using American dog mites was performed on 1-28 and 1-71. The test results are shown in the following table. The number of the upper portion of the cell in the table shows the average number of surviving parasites, and the lower portion shows the efficacy (%).
