Step 3: preparation of intermediate trans-6-allyloxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-iodo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1d)
To a solution of trans-N-allyloxy-6-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-iodo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-3-amine (1c) (7.99 g, 18.83 mmol) in anhydrous ACN (980 mL) at 0Â°C under inert atmosphere was added TEA (10.56 mL, 75.31 mmol). A solution of diphosgene (1.14 mL, 9.41 mmol) in anhydrous ACN (20 mL) was added dropwise over 5 h. Once the addition finished, the reaction mixture was allowed to reach rt and stirred for 3 days. H2O was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc 100/0 to 80/20) to give trans-6-allyloxy-2-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-iodo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (1d) (7.25 g, 16.10 mmol, 85%).
