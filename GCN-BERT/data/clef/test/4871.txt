FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition for altering the color of keratin fibers such as the hair. The cosmetic composition comprises at least one fatty substance, at least one acrylic polymer, at least one salt and a cosmetically acceptable solvent. The cosmetic composition further comprises at least one oxidizing agent and may additionally contain a colorant compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that consumers desire to use cosmetic and personal care compositions that enhance the appearance of keratin fibers such as hair by changing the color of the hair and/or by imparting various properties to hair, for example, shine and conditioning. The process of changing the color of hair can involve depositing an artificial color onto the hair which provides a different shade or color to the hair and/or lifting the color of the hair, such as lightening the color of dark hair to lighter shades. The process of lifting the color of hair, also known as lightening, generally requires the use of compositions that comprise at least one oxidizing agent. When colorants or dye compounds such as oxidation dye precursors and direct dyes are present in these compositions, such compositions can change or deposit color and lighten the color of hair at the same time. Conventional hair coloring products are permanent dye compositions comprising oxidation dye precursors, which are also known as primary intermediates or couplers. These oxidation dye precursors are colorless or weakly colored compounds which, when combined with oxidizing agents, give rise to colored complexes by a process of oxidative condensation. In general, hair lightening or color lifting compositions and hair dyeing compositions possess an alkalinity such that these compositions have a pH value of above 7, typically being at pH 9 and above, and may generally require the presence of an alkalizing agent such as ammonia or an ammonia gas generating compound and/or an amine or ammonium-based compound in amounts sufficient to make such compositions alkaline. The alkalizing agent causes the hair shaft to swell, thus allowing the small oxidative dye molecules to penetrate the cuticle and cortex before the oxidation condensation process is completed. The resulting larger-sized colored complexes from the oxidative reaction are then trapped inside the hair fiber, thereby permanently altering the color of the hair. While such hair dyeing and/or color lifting compositions can effectively alter the color of hair, these compositions can damage the hair fibers and/or irritate the scalp and may be accompanied by an undesirable odor of ammonia. Thus, in order to reduce or avoid the drawbacks above, as well as to improve the cosmetic performance of hair color lifting and hair dyeing compositions, the use of new and additional ingredients and novel combinations of ingredients are continuously sought. However, the choice of ingredients or combinations of ingredients could pose difficulties insofar as they cannot be detrimental to other cosmetic attributes such as ease and uniformity of application, rheology or viscosity properties and stability of the compositions, color deposit and target shade formation, and/or result into more disadvantages such as increased damage or a less healthy look to the hair. It is therefore, desirable to provide the consumer with compositions and methods that can lift the color of hair and additionally, deposit color onto hair in an efficient or improved manner, while providing other cosmetic advantages such as shine, conditioning, and a healthy appearance to the hair. Furthermore, it is preferable to formulate such compositions that are less costly to manufacture by requiring less ingredients and/or lower levels of ingredients and/or employing a more efficient process of manufacture. Thus, the objective of the present invention is to obtain novel compositions for altering the color of hair by lifting or lightening the color of the hair and additionally, depositing color while providing conditioning, a healthy and shiny appearance to hair and minimizing the damage to the hair and other adverse effects to the consumer. Another objective of the invention is to provide compositions that have a unique, non-drip consistency or rheology and yet spreads easily on the hair. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure is directed to compositions and methods for changing or altering the color of hair. Exemplary methods comprise applying a composition comprising a cosmetic composition and an oxidizing composition, and subsequently applying the composition to the hair in order to lift or lighten the color of the hair. When the composition also contains dye compounds, the composition is also able to deposit color onto the hair. By way of example, there is a need to provide compositions and processes that provide for hair to be lightened, and if desired, additionally colored, while achieving a desired change in hair tone and minimizing damage to the hair. Lightening or lifting the color of the hair is typically evaluated by the variation in tone height before and after the application of a hair color-altering composition onto hair. This variation corresponds to the degree or level of lightening or lift. The notion of “tone” is based on the classification of the natural shades, one tone separating each shade from the shade immediately following or preceding it, which is well known to hairstyling professionals. The tone heights or levels range from 1 (black) to 10 (light blond), one unit corresponding to one tone; thus, the higher the number, the lighter the shade or the greater the degree of lift. Accordingly, in various exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, the compositions and methods described allow one to achieve a desired level of color “lift” in tone, i.e. to a higher number. In further exemplary embodiments, the compositions and methods described below allow one to additionally deposit color onto hair. In order to achieve these and other advantages, the present invention is drawn to a cosmetic composition comprising: (a) from about 10% to about 80% by weight of at least one fatty substance;(b) at least one acrylic polymer selected from crosslinked copolymers of (meth)acrylic acid and/or (C1-C6)alkyl esters and from acrylic associative polymers;(c) from about 0.5% to about 15% by weight of at least one salt selected from an ammonium salt other than an ammonium acetate salt, a quaternary ammonium salt, a quaternary diammonium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, a transition metal salt, an alkali metal salt other than an alkali metal phosphate salt, an agmatine salt, and mixtures thereof; and(d) at least one cosmetically acceptable solvent; all weights being based on the total weight of the composition. The present invention is also drawn to compositions comprising the above-described cosmetic composition and an oxidizing composition containing at least one oxidizing agent and a cosmetically acceptable solvent selected from water and a water/organic solvent mixture. The present invention is also drawn to a process of lifting or lightening the color of keratin fibers, such as hair, comprising applying onto the said fibers, a composition comprising the above-described cosmetic and oxidizing compositions; and leaving the composition on the fibers for a period of time sufficient to lighten the fibers. The above-described cosmetic composition may further comprise at least one colorant compound. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients and/or reaction conditions are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about” which encompasses +10%. “At least one” as used herein means one or more and thus includes individual components as well as mixtures/combinations. “Keratin fiber” may be chosen from, for example, human hair. The term “altering the color” or “color-altering” as used herein may refer lifting or lightening the color of hair. It can also refer to dyeing or coloring hair or depositing color onto the hair. In certain instances, it refers to lifting or lightening the color of hair and depositing color onto the hair at the same time. “Formed from,” as used herein, means obtained from chemical reaction of, wherein “chemical reaction,” includes spontaneous chemical reactions and induced chemical reactions. As used herein, the phrase “formed from”, is open ended and does not limit the components of the composition to those listed, e.g., as component (i) and component (ii). Furthermore, the phrase “formed from” does not limit the order of adding components to the composition or require that the listed components (e.g., components (i) and (ii)) be added to the composition before any other components. “Hydrocarbons,” as used herein, include alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, wherein the alkanes comprise at least one carbon, and the alkenes and alkynes each comprise at least two carbons; further wherein the hydrocarbons may be chosen from linear hydrocarbons, branched hydrocarbons, and cyclic hydrocarbons; further wherein the hydrocarbons may optionally be substituted; and further wherein the hydrocarbons may optionally further comprise at least one heteroatom intercalated in the hydrocarbon chain. “Silicone compound,” as used herein, includes, for example, silica, silanes, silazanes, siloxanes, and organosiloxanes; and refers to a compound comprising at least one silicon; wherein the silicone compound may be chosen from linear silicone compounds, branched silicone compounds, and cyclic silicone compounds; further wherein the silicone compound may optionally be substituted; and further wherein the silicone compound may optionally further comprise at least one heteroatom intercalated in the silicone chain, wherein the at least one heteroatom is different from the at least one silicon. “Substituted,” as used herein, means comprising at least one substituent. Non-limiting examples of substituents include atoms, such as oxygen atoms and nitrogen atoms, as well as functional groups, such as hydroxyl groups, ether groups, alkoxy groups, acyloxyalkyl groups, oxyalkylene groups, polyoxyalkylene groups, carboxylic acid groups, amine groups, acylamino groups, amide groups, halogen containing groups, ester groups, thiol groups, sulphonate groups, thiosulphate groups, siloxane groups, and polysiloxane groups. The substituent(s) may be further substituted. “Polymers,” as defined herein, include homopolymers and copolymers formed from at least two different types of monomers. “(Meth)acrylic” as used herein, is understood to mean, within the meaning of the present patent application, “acrylic or methacrylic”. The term “substantially free of ammonia” as defined herein means that the compositions of the present invention are completely free of ammonia (including ammonium ions) or contains no appreciable amount of ammonia (including ammonium ions) or contains no appreciable amounts of ammonia gas generating compounds, for example, no more than 1% by weight, or no more than 0.5% by weight, or no more than 0.3% by weight, or no more than 0.1% by weight, based on the weight of the cosmetic compositions or compositions comprising the cosmetic composition and the oxidizing composition of the invention. It has been surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that when the cosmetic composition of the present invention contains an oxidizing agent or when it is mixed with an oxidizing composition containing an oxidizing agent, improved hair color lightening or lifting effects are achieved. For example, the composition provides good uniformity of lift along the fiber between the tip and the root of the hair (also called the selectivity of lightening). Moreover, the composition can be applied without difficulty onto keratin fibers without running or dripping and less amount of oxidizing agent can be used in order to achieve the desired level of lift or lightening. It has also now been surprisingly discovered that altering the color of hair by way of lifting the color of hair can be achieved using the process and compositions of the present invention, and particularly, using a composition having a pH of from 2 to 7 and comprising the cosmetic composition and oxidizing composition of the present invention. Moreover, it was surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that by using the compositions of the present invention, it was possible to achieve acceptable lift to the color of the hair that corresponds to an increase in tone height in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 4. Furthermore, when the cosmetic composition of the present invention additionally contains dye compounds, it was surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that the composition can also deposit color effectively and comparably to, if not better, than traditional or commercial hair dyes using similar or less amounts of dye compounds. Thus, the compositions and process of the present invention can provide for improved color visibility and better color coverage. It has also been surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the cosmetic composition of the invention can provide the desired cosmetic performance and attributes at lower manufacturing costs due to one or more of the following factors: lower amounts of dyes used, nature or number of ingredients, less time of production, and process of making wherein the cosmetic composition of the present invention can be prepared by a cold process method, i.e., without the use of heat.

In certain embodiments, the pH of the oxidizing composition is below 7. The pH of the composition resulting from mixing together the cosmetic composition and the oxidizing composition, may range from about 2 to about 7, such as from about 3 to about 6.9, or from about 4 to about 6.9, or from about 4 to about 6.85, or from about 5 to about 6.8. All numbers expressing pH values are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about” which encompasses up to +3%. According to at least one embodiment, the cosmetic compositions and compositions comprising the cosmetic composition and the oxidizing composition of the present invention are substantially free of ammonia. The cosmetic composition of the present disclosure is preferably in the form of an emulsion, for example, oil-in-water emulsion and water-in-oil emulsion.

The compositions of the present invention according to the disclosure can also comprise at least one additive used conventionally in compositions for application onto hair. “Additive” means a substance that is added, different from the compounds already mentioned. As examples of additives that can be used, non-limiting mentions can be made of antioxidants or reducing agents, penetrating agents, sequestering agents, perfumes, buffers, dispersants, ceramides, sunscreen agents, preservatives, opacifiers, and antistatic agents. The cosmetic and oxidizing compositions of the present invention according to the disclosure can be in various forms, such as in the form of liquids, creams, liquid-gels, liquid-creams, gels, lotions or pastes. It was surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that the use of nonionic surfactants helped stabilize the cosmetic composition (i.e., there was no phase separation) when oxidative dye precursors are present in the composition. Thus, in preferred embodiments, when colorant compounds such as oxidative dye precursors are present in the cosmetic composition, at least one nonionic surfactant is also present. Preferably, the nonionic surfactant is chosen from alkoxylated nonionic surfactants. In preferred embodiments, the process of making the cosmetic composition involves a cold process that does not require the use of heat while the ingredients are mixed and does not require the use of an emulsifier blade. In other preferred embodiments, the cosmetic composition does not require the presence of a fatty alcohol in order to form an emulsion. When the cosmetic composition does not contain a fatty alcohol, the cosmetic composition may be prepared in the absence of heat using mixing speeds at shearing rates that are lower than the shearing rates used to prepare conventional/commercial hair lighteners that are typically provided in the form of emulsions. According to the present disclosure, the process of making the cosmetic composition involves the general procedure of: mixing the acrylic polymer (e.g, Carbopol® Aqua SF-1 or Carbopol® Aqua SF-2) with water using a mixer, if necessary, adding an amount of a neutralizing agent, such as ethanolamine, to the mixture, in order to neutralize the acrylic polymer (as indicated by the formation of a clear solution), adding a fatty substance (e.g., mineral oil) and optionally, nonionic surfactant (s) while mixing, wherein the speed of mixing can be increased to ensure proper mixing), optionally, adding more of the fatty substance and/or another fatty substance and/or an emulsifying agent if an emulsion is desired, while continuously mixing, optionally, adding an organic solvent (e.g. ethanol and/or glycerin and/or propylene glycol), adding salt (e.g., ammonium chloride) and optionally, dyes or colorant compounds, auxiliary ingredients, additional fatty substances, and antioxidants e.g., sodium bisulfite and erythrobic acid. The acrylic polymer may also be pre-neutralized before it is combined with the other ingredients according to the process above. The above-described process is a cold process, that is, it does not require heat and reduces the amount of time needed to prepare a conventional/commercial hair cosmetic composition. Process of Lifting the Color of Hair or Altering the Color of Hair The cosmetic compositions of the present invention are capable of being mixed with an oxidizing composition containing at least oxidizing agent. The term “mixed” and all variations of this term as used herein refers to contacting or combining or reconstituting or dissolving or dispersing or blending or shaking the cosmetic composition with the oxidizing composition. It can also mean introducing the cosmetic composition to the oxidizing composition. It may also mean placing the cosmetic composition in the same vessel or container as the oxidizing composition. Thus, the process of lifting or altering the color of hair in accordance with the invention comprises applying a composition comprising the cosmetic composition and the oxidizing composition of the present invention onto hair. Said composition that is applied onto hair is formed by mixing the cosmetic composition with the oxidizing composition. The cosmetic composition can be mixed or combined with the oxidizing composition in a ratio by weight of from about 1:1 to about 1:10, such as from about 1:1 to about 1:4, preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:3, or preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:2. Upon application of the composition comprising the cosmetic composition and the oxidizing composition and after a resting time (leave-on time) on the keratin fibers, for example, ranging from about 1 to about 60 minutes, such as from about 5 to about 45 minutes, or such as from about 5 to about 20 minutes, or such as from about 10 to about 20 minutes, or such as of about 20 minutes, the keratin fibers are rinsed, optionally washed with shampoo, rinsed again, optionally washed with a hair conditioning composition, and rinsed again, then dried. The shampoo and hair conditioning composition can be any conventional hair shampoo and conditioner products. In addition, independently of the embodiment use, the mixture or composition present on the fibers or hair (resulting from the extemporaneous mixing of the compositions, or from the successive application of the cosmetic and oxidizing compositions) is left in place for a time, generally, from about 1 to about 60 minutes, such as from about 5 to about 45 minutes, or such as from about 5 to about 20 minutes, or such as from about 10 to about 20 minutes, or such as of about 20 minutes. The temperature during the process of lifting or altering the color of hair is between room temperature and 80° C. and preferably, between room temperature and 60° C. It has been surprisingly discovered that the combination of the fatty substance, the acrylic polymer, the salt and a cosmetically acceptable solvent results in a stable cream or liquid emulsion cosmetic composition which, when combined with the oxidizing composition of the present invention, produces a final mixture or a composition with a non-drip consistency that is still easy to spread on keratin fibers, such as hair. It has also been discovered that the application of the final mixture or composition onto the fibers results in satisfactory lifting or lightening of the color of the fibers. When the cosmetic composition of the present invention further comprises a colorant compound selected from oxidative dye precursors, direct dyes, pigments or their mixtures, the fibers are also colored satisfactorily with respect to degree of color deposit and desirable shade formation coloring. At the same time, lower amounts of the oxidizing agent and/or lower amounts of oxidative dye precursors and dye compounds can be used compared to conventional dyeing compositions. The coloring obtained using the compositions and process of the present disclosure may also be durable or wash/fade resistant. The lifting of the color of the hair is evaluated by the tone height or level which describes the degree or level of lift or lightening. The tone heights range from 1 (black) to 10 (light blond), one unit corresponding to one tone; the higher the number, the lighter the shade or the greater the degree of lift. It was surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that by using the compositions and process of the present invention on hair, the color of the hair was sufficiently lightened such that the degree of lift (increase in tone height) ranged from 0.5 to 4, such as from 1 to 3 or such as from 1 to 2. For example, when the starting tone height before treating the hair is 5, and the tone height after treating the hair is 6, then the degree of lift or increase in tone height is 1. At the same time, the hair treated with the compositions of the invention did not feel as rough and did not visually appear to be as damaged as hair treated with conventional dyeing or lifting compositions. As used herein, the process and composition disclosed herein may be used on the hair that has not been artificially dyed or pigmented. As used herein, the process and composition disclosed herein may be also used on the hair that has been artificially dyed or pigmented. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations, unless otherwise indicated the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. The examples that follow serve to illustrate embodiments of the present disclosure without, however, being limiting in nature.

The solution became a clear thick gel upon complete neutralization. The speed of mixing was increased to at least about 600 rpm. The solution became thicker & turned into a white paste. 80 g of mineral oil was added to the solution to create an emulsion and the speed of mixing was increased to at least about 1000 RPM. One half of the remainder of the oil, was then added to the emulsion and mixing was continued for about 10 minutes. The speed of mixing was increased to at least about 1200 RPM to ensure proper mixing. One half of the total concentration of organic solvent (glycerin) was added to adjust or decrease the viscosity of the emulsion The remainder of the mineral oil was then added and mixing was continued for a few minutes. The salt was added as well. Any desired additional ingredients such as dyes or colorant compounds, chelants, an additional fatty substance and/or additives or auxiliary ingredients, were added at this stage. The anti-oxidants, sodium sulfite and erythorbic acid, were also added to the emulsion. The speed of mixing was decreased. The remainder of the ethanolamine was added to the emulsion to adjust the pH. Citric acid was used to adjust the pH, if necessary.

It was found that before mixing with an oxidizing composition, the inventive cosmetic compositions had an excellent, non-drip consistency. This consistency remained even after the inventive cosmetic compositions were mixed with the oxidizing compositions.

Two parameters, L and ΔE (delta-E), were measured. L* represents the intensity of the color, a* indicates the green/red color axis and b* the blue/yellow color axis. According to this system, the greater the value of L, the lighter or less intense the color. Conversely, the lower the value of L, the darker or more intense the color (this can also indicate greater color deposit when the composition contains colorants). The ΔL or the difference between the L value for the treated hair versus the L value for the control hair swatch represents a change in the value of L: the more negative the ΔL value is, the darker the color that is deposited on the hair: ΔL=Lt (treated hair)−Lc (control hair) Delta-E (ΔE) represents color change. If ΔE is less than 1.0 there is hardly any color difference that the human eye can see. If ΔE greater than 1.0, then there is a noticeable color difference. The following tables show the color changes imparted to the hair.

The results above show that the color of the level 3 and level 6 hair treated in accordance with the invention was significantly lifted (i.e., lighter) as evidenced by the higher L values compared to the control hair swatch (observation by eye and colorimetric measurements). In addition, the degrees of lightening/lift and color changes on hair treated with the composition prepared from the cosmetic composition of the invention were comparable to those obtained with the compositions prepared from the comparative compositions (observation by eye and colorimetric measurement of delta). Thus, even at an acidic pH and with minimal amount of neutralizing agents (such as remaining or residual unreacted ethanolamine after neutralizing the acrylic polymer), the compositions of the invention were still able to lighten or lift the color of the hair as effectively as or even better compared to the comparative compositions an acidic composition prepared from Formula E and alkaline compositions prepared from Formulas D and F, each containing a significant amount of ethanolamine at 4.2% by weight. Example III Stability Studies The inventive compositions, Formula A, B, and C above were heated from between 20° C.-60° C. in a controlled environment chamber. The compositions showed no phase separation and maintained their cream-like structure. Stability was also independent of the presence of oxidation dyes and levels of the high viscosity oil. The stability of these formulas were also tested against a formula that did not contain salt e.g., ammonium chloride, sodium acetate. It was found that while the formula without the salt remained stable for 8 weeks, the inventive formulas remained stable for a longer period of time.

The L values in the table above also show that the color of the hair was significantly more lifted or lighter after contacting the hair with the compositions prepared from the inventive cosmetic compositions as compared to the color of the hair contacted with the control formula. Moreover, the degree of lifting or lightening of the color increased with increasing amounts of fatty substance (mineral oil). Example V Levels and Degrees of Lift A. Inventive Formula B Versus Comparative Formula F Half-head studies on the hair of human volunteers were conducted in order to compare the degrees of lift of color on hair provided by the compositions prepared from the inventive cosmetic compositions with those provided by the compositions prepared from the comparative cosmetic compositions composition. Processing time of these compositions (“test compositions”) on the hair was 20 minutes. The hair was then rinsed and dried. The degree of lift in the color of the hair was determined by visually comparing the tone or lightness/darkness of the hair before and after contacting the hair with the test compositions (invention and comparative) and also by comparing the hair contacted with the compositions of the invention with the color tones of standard hair swatches. TABLE 9 Comparison to an alkaline system Natural Level after treating hair Level Invention Comparative before Cosmetic composition, Cosmetic composition, treating Formula B + oxidizing Formula F + oxidizing Test hair composition, Formula I composition, Formula II 1 5.0 6.0 6.5 2 6.0 7.0 7.75 3 4.0 5.0 6.5 Formula B that did not contain salt (“formula B without salt”) was also tested on hair. The degree of color lift provided by formula B without salt ranged from zero up to 0.25 (for example, if the starting color level of untreated hair was 5, after treating the hair with formula B without salt, the color level was at from between 5 to 5.25). The results in Table 9 above surprisingly and unexpectedly showed that the composition of the invention consistently lifted the color of the hair by one level, i.e., the degree of lift was 1. This color lifting capability of the inventive composition allows for enhanced gray coverage when dye compounds are present in the inventive cosmetic composition. While Formula F demonstrated greater lift, the results for this comparative formula can be attributed to its alkaline nature due to the presence of higher levels of ethanolamine (4.2% by weight) which is less desirable with respect to the condition of or adverse effect on the hair fibers. On the other hand, the composition prepared from the cosmetic composition of the invention still produced an acceptable level of lift to the color of the hair even when the amount of ethanolamine in the base formula was much lower at about 1% or less by weight such that the composition had a pH below 7 (acidic system).

At the same time, using the same dye concentrations, the hair contacted with the compositions prepared from inventive Formula A exhibited comparable and/or greater color deposit as evidenced by the L values compared to the hair contacted with the compositions prepared from the comparative Formulas. Example VIII Levels and Degrees of Lift Using Formulas with Dyes Half-head studies on the hair of human volunteers were conducted in order to determine the degrees of lift of color on hair provided by the compositions prepared from the inventive cosmetic compositions. Processing time of these compositions on the hair was 20 minutes. The hair was then rinsed and dried. The level of color or tone height of the hair was determined as described above.

Thus, the inventive composition imparts lift to color of hair (increase in tone height or color level) while allowing for enhanced gray coverage in the presence of dye compounds. Example IX Hair Damage The extent of hair damage (if any) imparted to hair by contacting the hair with the test inventive and test comparative conventional acidic and alkaline compositions was evaluated based on the texture and feel of the hair and by determining the amount of cysteic acid in the hair using amino acid analysis. The cysteic acid content is one way to measure the amount of damage to hair fibers caused by various chemical treatments performed on hair such as dyeing, lightening and bleaching. The higher the cysteic acid content, the more damage done to the hair. The cysteic acid content can be correlate to the degrees of damage imparted to the hair. Hair samples were processed with 1 cycle (1× application) or 5 cycles of contacting the hair with the product, leaving the product for a period of time on the hair, washing the hair, and then drying the hair It was observed that the hair contacted with the inventive composition, formula A, and compositions prepared from the acidic comparative composition had a smoother feel than the hair contacted with the alkaline comparative compositions. TABLE 13 Level of cysteic acid Treatment on Hair samples 1X application 5X application Control - untreated 0.5 0.5 Treatment product: Cosmetic composition + oxidizing composition Formula A (Invention) + 0.7 0.9 Formula II Comparative composition, 0.7 0.8 acidic system Comparative composition, 0.8-1.0 1.4-2.5 alkaline system Based on the measured amounts of cysteic acid, the degree of damage to the hair contacted with the composition prepared from the inventive formula A was: (i) comparable to that assessed from the hair treated with the acidic comparative composition at 1× and 5× applications; and (ii) significantly less than the degree of damage assessed from the hair treated with the alkaline comparative composition. These results show that the compositions of the invention in an acidic system are able to lift the color of hair and deposit color effectively onto hair while leaving the hair less damaged, even when these compositions contained less amount of dyes than typical hair dyeing compositions.
