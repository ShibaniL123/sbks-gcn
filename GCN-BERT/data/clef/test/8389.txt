Government Rights [0002] The United States Government has certain rights to the invention pursuant to Grant/Contract Nos. DE-SC0001087 and DE-AC05-06OR23100 from U.S. Department of Energy and Grant/Contract No. DMR-0820506 from the NSF. Technical Fields of the Invention [0003] The invention generally relates to materials and methods for organic photovoltaics and solar cells. More particularly, the invention relates to novel functional fullerene interlayers, their applications in organic photovoltaics, and the resulting improved solar cells. Background of the Invention [0004] Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is a rapidly growing area of research worldwide due to its promise to offer low temperature, inexpensive processing of lightweight and flexible solar cells. OPV cells based on organic polymers are of interest as alternative sources of renewable electrical energy to the typical silicon-based cell. Dramatic improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk heteroj unction (BHJ) polymer-containing solar cells (PSCs) include recent reports on devices with PCE values exceeding 9%. (He, et al. 2012 Nat. Photonics 6, 591-595; You, et al. 2013 Nat. Commun. 4, 1410-1446; Liu, et al. 2013 Sci. Rep. 3, 3356; You, et al. 2013 Adv. Mater. 25, 3973- 3978; Yao, et al. 2014 Adv. Energy Mater. doi: 10.1002/aenm.201400206.) [0005] However, achieving such high efficiency requires increasingly complex polymer syntheses and device architectures (e.g. fabrication of tandem devices). In addition, the use of aluminum as the most common metal cathode lacks practicality owing to its rapid oxidation and inability to be processed from solution. More stable metals, like Ag, Cu, or Au, can be deposited from solution, but have limited utility as cathodes in organic photovoltaics due to their high work-function ( ) that further limits the open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) due to low a built-in electrostatic potential difference across the device. (Krebs 2009 Sol. Energ. Mat. Sol. Cells 93, 465-475; Krebs, et al. 2009 J. Mater. Chem. 19, 5442-5451 ; Guo, et al. 2013 Adv. Energy Mater. 3, 1062-1067.) [0006] To circumvent this limitation, a thin buffer layer inserted between the active layer and cathode tailors the interface, maximizes Voc, and minimizes contact resistance. Numerous inorganic buffer layers have been studied, such as Ca and LiF, while organic interlayers would be better suited to solution-based device fabrication. (Yip, et al. 2012 Energy Environ. Sci. 5, 5994-601 1 ; Duan, et al. 2013 Chem. Soc. Rev. 42, 9071-9104; Gu, et al. 2014 Adv. Energy Mater. doi: 10.1002/ aenm.201301771.) [0007] Conductive interlayers such as Ca, advantageous for their intrinsically low Φ, suffer from their relative lability and sensitivity to oxygen or water. Polar organic interlayers permit layer-by- layer solution deposition, but have poor adhesion to low surface energy active layers, thus limiting their utility in conventional device architectures (as fabricated from anode-to-cathode). (Zhang, et al. 2013 J. Mater. Chem. A 1, 9624-9629.) Furthermore, buffer layers are typically very thin (< 5 nm), so as to prevent charge-build up due to large injection barriers at the active layer/buffer layer interface or slow charge transport through the buffer layer. However, from a processing standpoint, the need to reproduce precise nanometer or sub-nanometer interlayer thicknesses is in itself problematic. [0008] Buffer layers, or interlayers, lower the work function of the cathode, with a magnitude frequently described by the interfacial dipole (A), where large negative A values have produced some of the most effective reported OPVs. (Worfolk, et al. 2012 Adv. Energy Mater. 2, 361-368.) For example, solution-processed dimethylaminopropyl-substituted polyfluorene (PFN) yielded a maximum PCE of 9.21% in an inverted device, while poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) and its derivatives enabled all-solution-processed inverted devices with maximum PCE values of 8.9%. (Zhou, et al. 2012 Science 336, 327-332; Woo, et al. 2014 Adv. Energy Mater. doi: 10.1002/aenm.201301692.) In each case, the amine functionality of the interlayer is responsible for the large negative A values (< - 0.5 eV). However, these interlayers have their own drawbacks - the PFN backbone is intrinsically p- type, while PEI is insulating and exhibits poor adhesion to the photoactive layer. [0009] With respect to electrode selection, recent reports of BHJ PSCs using a bathocuproine (BCP) interlayer with a Ag cathode achieved PCEs of 7.7 and 8.1%, representing benchmark values to-date for standard single-junction PSCs containing Ag cathodes. (Martinez-Otero, et al. 2013 Adv. Optical Mater. 1, 37-42;Betancur, et al. 2013 Nat. Photonics 7, 995-1000.) However, BCP requires a thermal deposition step and a precisely defined interlayer thickness (3.5 nm) to be effective. (Martinez-Otero, et al. 2013 Adv. Optical Mater. 1, 37-42.) Conjugated polymer zwitterions (CPZs) were recently reported that show large negative A values (-0.5 eV to -0.9 eV) on metal electrodes. (Page, et al. 2013 Macromolecules 46, 344-351 ; Liu, et al. 2013 Adv. Mater. 25, 6868-6873; Page, et al. 2014 Chem. Sci. doi: 10.1039/c4sc00475b.) Spin-coating CPZs and the active layer polymer from orthogonal solvents provides good control over interlayer thickness with little disruption of the underlying surface. To date, CPZs have demonstrated effectiveness as interlayers in OPV devices over a thickness range of -5-10 nm; however, thicker films are not useful due to the p-type characteristics of the selected polymers. (Liu, et al. 2013 Adv. Mater. 25, 6868-6873.) [0010] Inverted polymer solar cells (iPSCs) containing high work function metal anodes (e.g., Ag or Au) and modified indium tin oxide (ITO) cathodes exhibit superior efficiency and stability over PSCs with a conventional geometry. (He, et al. 2012 Nat. Photon. 6, 591 ; Chen, et al. 2009 Adv. Mater. 21, 1434; Hau, et al. 2010 Polym. Rev. 50, 474; Jorgensen, et al. 2012 Adv. Mater. 24, 580; Liu, et al. 2013 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 135, 15326; Zhang, et al. 2014 Adv. Energy Mater. DOI: 10.1002/aenm.201400359.) iPSCs preclude the need for a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT: PSS) hole transport layer, which is corrosive to ITO and leads to device deterioration. (Xu, et al. 2009 Adv. Fund. Mater. 19, 1227; Yang, et al. 2012 Adv. Energy Mater. 2, 523; Jorgensen, et al. 2008 Sol. Energ. Mat. Sol. C. 92, 686.) [001 1] A major limitation associated with iPSCs is the large barrier to electron extraction at the photoactive layer-ITO interface. To address this limitation, inorganic materials are implemented as electron transport layers (ETLs), including zinc oxide (ZnO), cesium carbonate (CS2CO3), titanium oxide (TiOx), and titanium chelate. (You, et al. 2012 Adv. Mater. 24, 5267; White, et al. 2006 Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 143517; Sun, et al. 2011 Adv. Mater. 23, 1679; Li, et al. 2006 Appl. Phys. Lett. 88, 253503; Liao, et al. 2008 Appl. Phys. Lett. 92, 173303; Waldauf, et al. 2Mb Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 233517; Tan, et al. 2012 Adv. Mater. 24, 1476.) However, organic ETLs possess inherent advantages over inorganic layers for their ease of processing and favorable mechanical properties. (Yip, et al. 2012 Energy Environ. Sci. 5, 5994; Duan, et al. 2013 Chem. Soc. Rev. 42, 9071.) Prime examples of organic ETLs used for ITO modification in iPSCs include polyfluorene derivatives (PFNs), polyethyleneimine (PEI), and ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE). (He, et al. 2012 Nat. Photon. 6, 591 ; Liu, et al. 2013 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 135, 15326; He, et al. 2011 Adv. Mater. 23, 4636; Kang, et al. 2012 Adv. Mater. 24, 3005; Lee, et al. 2013 Energy Environ. Sci. 6, 1 152; Zhou, et al. 2012 Science 336, 327.) In these devices, the amine groups impart a large negative interfacial dipole (A) (< -0.5 eV) that reduces the energy barrier to charge extraction and increases the built-in potential of the device. However, these ETLs have drawbacks - the PFN backbone is intrinsically p-type, whereas PEI and PEIE are insulating and exhibit poor adhesion to the active layer. [0012] Interest is thus emerging in fullerene-based ETLs that promote rapid electron transport and selectivity, and provide the capacity for π-π interactions to enhance adhesion with the active layer. (Yao, et al. 2014 Adv. Energy Mater. 4, 1400206; O'Malley, et al. 2012 Adv. Energy Mater. 2, 82; Yang, et al. 2013 Adv. Energy Mater. 3, 666; Wei, et al. 2008 Adv. Mater. 20, 221 1 ; Mei, et al. 2013 ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 5, 8076; Li, et al. 2013 J. Mater. Chem. A 1, 12413; Li, et al. 2013 Adv. Energy Mater. 3, 1569; Lai, et al. 2013 ACSAppl. Mater. Interfaces 5, 5122.) However, only a few examples of fullerene based ETLs are sufficiently robust to endure multilayer solution processing, including thermally cross-linked fullerene derivatives, a phosphoric diethyl ester functionalized fullerene, a fullerene/ZnO composite, and a blend of fulleropyrrolidinium iodide (FPI) and PEIE (FPI-PEIE). (Hsieh, et al. 2010 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 132, 4887; Duan, et al. 2012 Chem. Mater. 24, 1682; Cheng, et al. 2013 ACSAppl. Mater. Interfaces 5, 6665; Liao, et al. 2013 Adv. Mater. 25, 4766; Liao, et al. 2014 Sci. Rep. 4, 6813; Li, et al. 2014 Adv. Mater. 26, 6262.) [0013] Realizing uniform ultrathin films over large areas represents a significant challenge, yet most efficient iPSCs reported to-date require an ultrathin ETL (e.g., ~5 nm of PEIE or PFN). While a recent report describing the incorporation of mercury into PFN (PFEN-Hg) achieves thickness independent properties, mercury carries inherent practical limitations. (Liu, et al. 2013 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 135, 15326.) Doping FPI with PEIE (FPI-PEIE) also leads to an ETL thickness independence, but the doping ratio needs to be elaborately controlled. (Li, et al. 2014 Adv. Mater. 26, 6262.) Simpler materials are thus needed to improve the properties of large area coatings while maintaining device efficiency. [0014] Accordingly, there remains an urgent, on-going need for novel materials, methods and designs to enable improved power conversion efficiencies of OPVs, especially novel approaches to interlayers for polymer-based solar cells. Summary of the Invention [0015] The invention provides novel materials, methods and designs to enable improved power conversion efficiencies of OPVs, especially novel approaches to interlayers for polymer-based solar cells. Novel functional fullerene-based interlayers are disclosed that enable high efficiency devices in conjunction with numerous active layer and electrode materials. High PCEs (exceeding 8.5%) were obtained irrespective of the cathodes work- function, even for the high work function Au, indicating a universal utility of these interlayers. The invention also allows dual utility of C60-SB in acting as a thickness insensitive cathode modification layer and electron acceptor in efficient iPSCs, while demonstrating its applicability to large area, room temperature, all-solution processed fabrication techniques with slot-die coating. [0016] In one aspect, the invention generally relates to a fullerene derivative having the structural formula: wherein R each is independently a neutral group selected from primary, secondary, tertiary amino groups, thiol group, phosphonate ester group, phosphoric acid group, or a zwitterionic group selected from sulfobetaine, carbocybetaine, phosphobetaine and phosphorylcholine groups; and x is an integer from 1 to 12. [0017] In another aspect, the invention generally relates to a buffer or interlayer adaptable for use in an organic photovoltaic (OPV) device, comprising one or more fulleropyrrolidine derivatives with each of which bearing: one or more neutral groups selected from primary, secondary, tertiary amino groups, thiol group, phosphonate ester group, phosphoric acid groups, or one or more zwitterionic groups. [0018] In yet another aspect, the invention generally relates to an OPV device comprising a buffer or interlayer disclosed herein. [0019] In yet another aspect, the invention generally relates to a solar cell panel or assembly, which includes the OPV device disclosed herein. Brief Description of the Drawings [0020] FIG. 1. Solar cell components and architecture. (A) Chemical structures of the two fulleropyrrolidines ( βο- and C60-SB) employed as cathode modification layers; (B) Device configuration, consisting of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/ESL/cathode, where PEDOT:PSS is the hole selective layer (HSL) and anode modifier, and Al, Ag, Cu or Au were used as the cathode; (C) Chemical structures of the compounds comprising the active layer, with PC71BM as the acceptor and PTB7 or PCE-10 as the donor. [0021] FIG. 2. OPV device performance for an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCE- 10:PC7iBM/(fulleropyrrolidine)/cathode architecture. (A) Representative J- curves for OPVs with bare Ag cathodes, and -15 nm-thick Οβο- and C60-SB interlayers; (B) Representative J- curves showing the effect of cathode work function on Voc for the bare metal devices, and impact on OPVs containing a thin layer (-15 nm) of C60- between the active layer and top cathode; (C) Device metrics obtained at varying interlayer thickness (from -5 to 55 nm). [0022] FIG. 3. (A) UPS of C60-alkyl, C60-N and C60-SB (-15 nm layers) on metal substrates, showing the high and low binding energy regions of Οβο- and C60-SB on Ag and of bare Ag used to determine A, Ip and Ep. The high binding energy region near the E C shows that C6o~N provides a larger A on Ag, -0.83 eV than C60-SB, -0.51 eV and Ceo-alkyl, -0.37 eV. The low binding energy region provides the Ip for Ceo-alkyl, Οβο- and C60-SB, giving 5.70 eV, 5.62 eV and 5.72 eV respectively. (B) Representative high binding energy region for Οβο- films on freshly prepared Ag, Cu and Au substrates that pins the work function of each modified metal surface at -3.9 eV or -3.65 eV for 1 nm and 15 nm films, respectively. (C) Work function modification of Ag, Cu and Au with C60- films of various thickness. Pinning of the effective work function pinning occurs is seen for very thin films (nominally 1 nm), and large modification of metal work function (to 3.65 eV) is achieved at film thickness >4 nm. [0023] FIG. 4. (A) Representative J-V curves for electron-only devices with PC71BM, PC71BM/C60- and C60- layers in-between ITO and Ag electrodes, revealing that Οβο- removes the barrier for electron injection from Ag into the bulk organic layer, forming Ohmic contact. The dashed lines show fits to the Mott-Gurney law in the range of a space charge limited current regime of device operation. (B) UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy of OPV devices varying Οβο- interlayer thickness from 4 to 57 nm (with no interlayer as a control). The increased reflectance from 600 to 740 nm for devices containing interlayers thicker than 7.7 nm is direct evidence of an "optical spacer" effect, which explains the reduced Jsc for OPV devices with thicker interlayers.

J-V curve of the certified device after it was returned from NREL, showing good agreement of device metrics using the solar simulator. Optimization of fulleropyrrolidine synthesis and isolation and OPV device fabrication later resulted in a PCEmax of 9.78 % for devices with the same general architecture. [0035] FIG. 16. UV-Vis absorption spectra of fulleropyrrolidines. Right spectra plotted against absorption coefficient as a logarithmic scale to help identify an approximate onset of absorption equal to 1.8 eV, which matches well with the difference in EA and Ip energies obtained using CV and UPS respectively. Absorption coefficients were determined by casting three relatively thick films (-150 nm) onto clean glass substrates, measuring their absorption profiles with UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, determining thickness using profilometry and taking the average values from both measurements as A (absorption, AU) and / (path length, cm) to determine the absorption or attenuation coefficient (a, cm"1) using the Beer-Lambert law for films: a =All.

Synthesis of amine-substituted mixed C60 C70 fullerenes, comparative device data, spectroscopic evidence of the similar electronic properties between the pure Ceo and mixed fullerene structures. Description of the Invention [0061] The invention provides novel materials, methods and designs to enable improved power conversion efficiencies of OPVs, especially novel approaches to interlayers for polymer-based solar cells. Novel functional fullerene-based interlayers are disclosed that enable high efficiency devices in conjunction with numerous active layer and electrode materials. For example, standard single- junction PSCs fabricated utilizing fulleropyrrolidines bearing terminal tertiary amine or sulfobetaine functionalities (e.g., Ceo- and C60-SB) as buffer layers provided very high PCE values for such conventional devices, and unprecedented efficiency (9.78%) for Ag cathode devices. High PCEs (exceeding 8.5%) were obtained irrespective of the cathodes work- function, even for the high work function Au, indicating a universal utility of these interlayers. [0062] Among the advantages of the invention are: (1) Novel functionalized carbon-based compounds (functional fullerenes) as efficient electron carriers; (2) Capabilities of generating high efficiencies from conventional device architecture (e.g., single junction conventional design rather than inverted or tandem types); (3) Enabling the use of Ag and other high work function metals as cathodes, which are advantageous over other typical electrodes such as aluminum due to stability. The use of Ag opens an opportunity to make an all-solution-processible device through the use of silver paste (slurry) in conjunction with the solution-processible organic/polymer components (active layer and interlayer); and (4) Improvements regarding thickness of the interlayer - the invention can tolerate thick (>50 nm) interlayers, which simplifies device fabrication. [0063] The invention also allows dual utility of C60-SB in acting as a thickness insensitive cathode modification layer and electron acceptor in efficient iPSCs, while demonstrating its applicability to large area, room temperature, all-solution processed fabrication techniques with slot-die coating. [0064] In one aspect, the invention generally relates to a fullerene derivative having the structural formula: wherein R each is independently a neutral group selected from primary, secondary, tertiary amino groups, thiol group, phosphonate ester group, phosphoric acid group, or a zwitterionic group selected from sulfobetaine, carbocybetaine, phosphobetaine and phosphorylcholine groups; and x is an integer from 1 to 12. [0065] The fullerene derivative may be based on any suitable fullerene compound, for example, the fullerene may be selected from Οβο, C70, C76, Cg2 and Cg4. In certain preferred embodiments, the fullerene is Ceo- In certain preferred embodiments, the fullerene is C70. [0066] The R groups may be selected to be all identical or not all identical. In certain embodiments, all R's are identical. In certain embodiments, all R's are not identical. [0067] Exemplary R groups include the following and derivatives thereof: Amine Methylamine Dimethylamine Thiol PhosphonateEster Phosphonic Acid [0068] In certain embodiments, each R is a neutral group. In certain preferred embodiments, each R is an amino group selected from primary, secondary, and tertiary amino groups. In certain preferred embodiments, each R is a tertiary amino group. [0069] In certain preferred embodiments, each R is a thiol group. [0070] In certain embodiments, each R is a zwitterionic group selected from sulfobetaine, carbocybetaine, phosphobetaine and phosphorylcholine groups. In certain preferred embodiments, each R is a sulfobetaine group. Sulfobetaine Carboxybetaine Phosphobetaine Phosphorylcholine [0071] "x" may be any suitable number, for example, an integer from 1 to 12 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12).

[0081 ] In yet another aspect, the invention generally relates to an OPV device comprising a buffer or interlayer disclosed herein. [0082] In general, the OPV device of the invention is characterized by a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8% or greater (e.g., preferably a PCE of 8.5% or greater, more preferably a PCE of 9.0% or greater, even more preferably a PCE of 9.5% or greater). [0083] In certain embodiments, the OPV device comprises a cathode of Al, Ag, Cu or Au. In certain preferred embodiments, the OPV device comprises an Ag cathode. [0084] In certain embodiments, the OPV device is a PSC. The OPV device may be a regular (conventional) PSC or an iPSC. [0085] In yet another aspect, the invention generally relates to a solar cell panel or assembly, which includes the OPV device disclosed herein. [0086] In certain preferred embodiments of the iPSC disclosed herein, it may include one or more tris(sulfobetaine)-substituted fullerenes (C60-SB) acting as both a (thickness insensitive) cathode modification layer and electron acceptor. [0087] In certain embodiments, the fulleropyrrolidine derivative utilized with the OPV device has the structural formula of wherein R each is independently a neutral group selected from primary, secondary, tertiary amino groups, thiol group, phosphonate ester group, phosphoric acid group, or a zwitterionic group selected from sulfobetaine, carbocybetaine, phosphobetaine and phosphorylcholine groups; and x is an integer from 1 to 12. [0088] An ideal cathode design for OPVs might consist of a metal with a high intrinsic work function to benefit stability, but a readily tailored surface to lower its effective work function to benefit device performance. It is demonstrated that novel functionalized fullerenes bearing tertiary amine (Ceo-N) or sulfobetaine (C60-SB) groups are easy to process in solution, with excellent adhesion to the photoactive layer, and afford OPV devices with outstanding PCE values even when employing high work function metals as cathodes. [0089] Disclosed herein are the synthesis, characterization and use of new trisubstituted polar fulleropyrrolidines as highly effective interlayer materials in polymer-based solar cells. The syntheses of tris(sulfobetaine)-substituted fullerene and its tris(dimethylamino)-substituted precursor, shown in Scheme 1, are rapid and efficient. PSCs utilizing this fullerene design in conjunction with Al, Ag, Cu and Au cathodes gave PCE values >8.5 %. Two different active layer polymers, used in conjunction these fullerene interlayers, showed dramatically increased performance as a result of the interlayer. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), charge mobility measurements, and reflectance spectroscopy provide insight to this observed efficiency enhancement. Scheme 1. Synthesis of fullerene interlayer materials Οβο- and C60-SB [0090] The amine (Ceo-N) and sulfobetaine (C6o-SB)-substituted fullerenes were prepared by connection of the corresponding trisubstituted phenyl groups through a pyrrolidine ring (FIG. 1A, Scheme 1). For Οβο- , Mitsunobu coupling gave the trifunctional benzaldehyde bearing pendant amines, followed by a Prato reaction to connect the benzaldehyde to fullerene-C6o. Ceo- served as a precursor to C60-SB, by use of the tertiary amines of Οβο- in ring-opening of 1,3-propanesultone. (Mitsunobu, et al. 1967 Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 40, 2380-2382; Maggini, et al. 1993 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115, 9798-9799; Prato, et al. 1998 Acc. Chem. Res. 31, 519-526.) These syntheses are rapid and efficienty, while precluding the need for methanofullerene derivatives prepared through unstable diazo intermediates. (Hummelen, et al. 1995 J. Org. Chem. 60, 532-538.) [0091] Single junction OPVs were fabricated with a BHJ active layer containing a blend of [6,6]- phenyl C7i-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor and a low bandgap conjugated polymer thieno[3,4-Z?]thiophene-a-benzodithiophene with either 2-(ethylhexyl)oxy (PTB7) or 2- (ethylhexyl)thienyl (PCE-10) side chains as the donor (FIG. IB and 1C) (data for PTB7 found in FIG. 13 and Table 1). (Liang, et al. 2010 Adv. Mater. 22, E135-E138.) In a device, C60-N or C60-SB was deposited by spin coating onto the active layer from trifluoroethanol (TFE), followed by deposition of the metal cathode (Al, Ag, Cu or Au). A device fabricated in this fashion, containing a Ag cathode, was examined and certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) with a PCE of 8.91% (FIG. 14), identical to the efficiency obtained in our laboratories (FIG. 15).

Error represents ± 1 standard deviation for averages obtained over six to eight devices and PCEmax is given in parenthases. [0092] The PCE-10:PC7iBM OPV devices fabricated with an Ag cathode were optimized further: whereas bare Ag control devices (no cathode modification layer) gave a PCE of 2.76 ± 0.59% (maximum PCE 3.72%), devices with C60-N or Ceo-SB interlayers yielded PCE values of 9.35 ± 0.13% (maximum PCE 9.78%) and 8.57 ± 0.15% (maximum PCE 8.92%), respectively (FIG. 2A and Table 2). This large efficiency improvement stems from higher Voc and FF values, given in the associated plots. Devices with bare Ag cathodes suffer from the high work function of Ag that creates insufficient built-in electrostatic potential difference. FIG. 2A shows that devices fabricated with C60-N interlayers outperform those with Ceo-SB interlayers due to higher Voc (0.75 - 0.78 V) and FF (68-71%). Devices were also fabricated using a standard Ca/Al cathode, giving PCEs of 8.36 ± 0.21% (Table 2). Comparable PCEs were obtained for devices with C60-N/AI and C60-SB/AI, with average PCEs of 8.65 ± 0.1 1 % and 8.29 ± 0.1 1 % respectively, thus eliminating the need for thermal deposition of Ca. (Grossiord, et al. 2012 Org. Electron. 13, 432-456.) [0093] OPV devices fabricated with Cu or Au cathodes, omitting a cathode-modifying interlayer, had low PCEs of 1.29 ± 0.06% and 0.99 ± 0.05% respectively, as expected from the high F values for Cu (4.7 eV) and Au (5.1 eV). (Tipler, P. A. and Llewellyn, R. A. Modern Physics, 3rd ed., W.H. Freeman, 1999.) However, by casting a ~15 nm thick layer of C60-N onto the active layer prior to cathode deposition, the Voc recovered to 0.75 V for Cu and 0.76 V for Au, producing devices with PCE values of 8.67 ± 0.17% (PCEmax = 8.88%) and 8.56 ± 0.21 % (PCEmax = 8.83%), respectively. The higher PCE values obtained for devices containing Ag cathodes over other metals is a direct result of higher Jsc'- 16.83 mA/cm2 for Ag, 16.01 mA/cm2 for Cu, and 15.75 mA/cm2 for Au. In addition, a large FF (~ 70%) was obtained, independent of the metal cathode, underscoring the universal nature of Ceo-Ν interlayers. These high work function metals have the important advantage of increasing device lifetime and, in the case of Ag, offer a pathway to all-solution-processing ultimately towards roll-to-roll techniques.

Al, Ag, Cu and Au were employed as cathodes. Error represents ± 1 standard deviation for averages obtained over six devices; PCEmax is given parenthetically. [0094] Seven different interlayer thicknesses were investigated over a range from 5 to 55 nm (FIG. 2C, FIGs. 16 - 17 and Table 3). Both C60-N and C60-SB produced devices with peak PCE at -15 nm interlayer thickness. For Ceo-Ν, Voc and FF plateaued at approximately 0.75 V and 70%, respectively, in accord with interlayer thickness, while Ceo-SB devices maintained a constant Voc (~ 0.75 V) and a slight decline in FF (from 68 to 65%) for films thicker than ~15 nm, and a decrease in Jsc from ~17 mA/cm2 (thickness < 15 nm) to ~13 mA/cm2 (thickness ~55 nm). Thus, these interlayers offer advantages over other interlayers, such as CPZs as previously reported, in which thickness must be controlled, since >10 nm layers result in S-shaped J-V curves and reduced PCE. (Liu, et al. 2013 Adv. Mater. 25, 6868-6873.) Unlike the CPZ interlayers, these fulleropyrrolidine interlayers afford efficient devices even at thicknesses exceeding 50 nm. Scheme 2.

The data was obtained by removing a thin layer of material using a razor blade, followed by at least 10 measurements around the active device area. Measurements were done between the Ag cathodes, such that the thickness data includes the following layers (where PEDOT:PSS was measured to be -30 nm thick): PEDOT:PSS/PCE-10:PC7iBM/(C60-N). The thickness of the interlayer was then calculated by taking the difference between the average control thickness (no interlayer) and measured thicknesses for devices containing interlayers. The results match well with those obtained using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. [0095] The interactions of Οβο- and C60-SB interlayers with metal surfaces were investigated and compared to interlayers from 2,3,4-tris(hexyloxy)fulleropyrrolidine (Ceo-alkyl) lacking the amine or sulfobetaine functionality (Scheme 2 and FIGs. 18-22). The three fullerenes had similar optoelectronic properties, with UV absorption onset indicating optical band gaps (Eg) of approximately 1.8 eV for each (FIG. 17), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) giving electron affinity (EA) values of 3.8-3.9 eV from the onset of reduction (FIG. 23). The high and low binding energy onsets in UPS showed that the ionization potential (Ip) for the fulleropyrrolidines ranged from 5.6-5.7 eV (FIG. 3A). Eg values calculated from the difference between EA and Ip correlated closely to the Eg values determined by UV-Vis absorbance spectroscopy (-1.8 ± 0.1 eV). The similar EA values of these fullerenes with that of PC71BM suggests that there is little-to-no energy barrier for electron transfer at the interface of PC71BM with fulleropyrrolidine interlayers. An appreciable energy barrier in these fulleropyrrolidine interlayers that would reduce FF due to interfacial charge build-up was not observed even at >15 nm thickness; as such, these substituted fullerene combine the benefits of electronic transport with polar, surface interacting functionality for improved device performance. [0096] The high binding energy region of the UPS spectra provides interfacial dipole (A) values that reflect difference in the high binding energy onset, or ESEc, of a bare vs coated metal substrate. UPS characterization of Οβο- , C6o-SB and Ceo-alkyl on freshly prepared Ag substrates revealed Ceo- N to have the largest A value, -0.83 ± 0.02 eV (FIG. 3A), which remained constant for films thicker than 8 nm, and was found to decrease for very thin films (in accord with the reduced Voc for those devices, Table 4). Table 4. UPS of Οβο- on Ag, varying fullerene thickness C 60-N on Ag Thickness (nm) = 4.0 7.7 11.5 15.2 24.0 32.2 -0.74 ± 0.01 -0.83 ± 0.02 -0.82 ± 0.03 -0.84 ± 0.02 -0.85 ± 0.01 -0.84 ± 0.01 I P (eV) 5.65 5.62 5.64 5.62 5.62 5.63 * Interfacial dipole increases by approximately 0.1 eV when going from 4.0 nm to 7.7 nm, but plateaus past this thickness, giving an interfacial dipole around -0.83 eV. This result agrees with the lower Voc obtained for OPV devices fabricated with a ~4 nm interlayer thickness of C60- , compared to those fabricated with thicker films. [0097] The larger A for Οβο- relative to C60-SB accounts for the higher Voc in those devices. A larger A value increases the built-in electrostatic potential difference in the device, improving charge extraction and reducing the recombination losses, which explains the higher Jsc and FF values for devices with Οβο- relative to C60-SB. The difference in work function of the electrodes coated with Ceo-alkyl and C60-SB (0.14 eV) arises from a permanent dipole effect due to interaction of zwitterionic sulfobetaine groups with metal surfaces, while the larger A for Οβο- is likely due to electron transfer from the tertiary amines to the metal substrate, a mechanism not available to the sulfobetaine zwitterions. (Liu, et al. 2013 Adv. Mater. 25, 6868-6873; Broker, et al. 2008 Appl. Phys. Lett. 93, 243303; Lindell, et al. 2008 Appl. Phys. Lett. 92, 163302; Lindell, et al. 2006 Chem. Mater. 18, 4246-4252.) [0098] The magnitude of A for Οβο- films on metal substrates exhibited a distinct dependence on film thickness (FIG. 3B). However, for ultrathin films (1 nm nominal thickness) of Οβο- on Ag, Cu or Au substrates, the effective work function was already "pinned", independent of the metal composition, at 3.9 eV. Observing this effect for such thin films indicates that pinning originates at the metal/C6o-N interface, though the exact mechanism of this interaction (specific chemisorption/physisorption interactions and associated modification of the electron density tail at the metal surface) is not understood fully. (Braun, et al. 2009 Adv. Mater. 21, 1450-1472.) With increasing Οβο- thickness, work function values saturated at 3.65 eV on Ag, Cu or Au (FIG. 3C). Such a gradual change of A within ~5 nm of the interface indicates a narrow space charge region in C60- films, similar to a depletion region at the metal/doped semiconductor interface. The formation of a positive space charge in Οβο- is consistent with the electron transfer from tertiary amines to the metal substrate. (Broker, et al. 2008 Appl. Phys. Lett. 93, 243303; Lindell, et al. 2008 Appl. Phys. Lett. 92, 163302; Lindell, et al. 2006 Chem. Mater. 18, 4246-4 Using the expression for a depletion layer width w = where Vu (= A) is the built- in potential, q is the elementary charge, EQ = 8.85x 10" F/m, sr (=5) is the dielectric constant, and w = 5 nm, the density of positive charges No can be estimated at 1 * 1019 cm"3. Taking the volume of a single Οβο- molecule as ~1 nm3, approximately 1 in 300 amines in the layer participates in electron donation to the metal. This effect is independent of the metal substrate, yielding an effective work function of 3.65 eV for C6o-N-modified Ag, Cu and Au electrodes (FIG. 3C). This suggests that Ceo- N provides Ohmic contact for electron injection as well as large built-in electrostatic potential difference for effective charge extraction in OPVs. The effect of these fullerenes on different metals confirms the general utility of these interfacial layer materials, and successful interfacial tailoring independent of electrode work function. [00100] Although device performance exceeded 6% for interlayers ranging from -5-55 nm, an optimum PCE was reached at ~15 nm thickness, followed by a steady decrease in efficiency for thicker interlayer films (FIG. 2C). To better understand the role of these polar fullerene interlayers, single-carrier devices were prepared to determine electron mobilities, using the modified Mott- 9 V2 Gurney law (/ = γ - εΐ.ε0μ— , where γ<1 is the contact non-ideality factor) for a space charge limited current (SCLC) regime of device operation (FIG. 4A and FIG. 24). First, electron-only devices were constructed using an ITO bottom electrode and Ca/Al top electrode with PC71BM, Ceo- or C60-SB as the bulk transport material. Assuming that Ca/Al is an Ohmic contact (γ=1), the electron mobilities of 5 x 10"4 cm2/Vs, 9 x 10"4 cm2/Vs and 1 x 10"5 cm2/Vs were estimated for PC71BM, C60-N and C60- SB, respectively (the dielectric constants, er, were determined by impedance spectroscopy to be 3.5 for PC71BM and 5.0 for C60-N and C60-SB, FIGs. 25-27). The higher electron mobility of C60-N compared to C60-SB explains why the photovoltaic devices with Ceo- interlayers work more efficiently up to larger interlayer thicknesses; while less efficient extraction of electrons through the thicker C60-SB interlayers leads to larger series resistance, reducing the FF and Jsc in such devices. Next, to determine whether Ag forms Ohmic contact with PC71BM directly and whether C60- interlayer improves its properties, devices were fabricated with an Ag top electrode and a PC71BM, PC7iBM/C6o-N or Ceo-N electron transport layer (FIG. 4A). Devices with only PC71BM showed evidence of a Schottky barrier, resulting in a γχμ product of 3 x 10~7 cm2/Vs, therefore indicating that γ<0.001 (3 orders of magnitude lower than in diodes with Ca/Al electrode). This is consistent with a relatively high work function of Ag (4.45 eV) as compared to the LUMO of PC71BM (3.9 eV). Inserting a layer of C60- (13 nm, 25 nm or 48 nm) between PC71BM and Ag leads to a mobility of 2.5 x 10"3 cm2/Vs (4 orders of magnitude higher). Therefore, C6o- /Ag forms a good Ohmic contact for electron injection into PC71BM, better than Ca/Al does, while the value of 2.5 x 10~3 cm2/Vs is a more accurate estimate of the electron mobility in PC71BM. In the photovoltaic devices, lower potential barrier for electron injection at Ohmic contact translates into larger built-in potential that leads to faster electron extraction and, therefore, to higher Jsc and FF. This is consistent with the systematically better performance of photovoltaic devices with C6o- /Ag cathode. Additionally, single-carrier devices with only Οβο- as the bulk transport material and top Ag electrodes gave electron mobility (1.1 x 10~3 cm2/Vs) equivalent to that measured using Ca/Al electrodes. Since the electron mobility of PC71BM is independent of C60- interlayer thickness and comparable to the electron mobility in Οβο- itself, electron transport through Οβο- in OPV devices is not hindered, and thus not the primary reason for decreasing PCEs with increasing interlayer thickness. [00101] To further examine the relationship between PCE and interlayer thickness, UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy was performed directly on OPV devices with Ag cathode and Οβο- interlayers of different thicknesses (FIG. 4B). The measurements were made through the ITO substrate at 5° with respect to surface normal. Devices with interlayers thicker than 7.7 nm exhibited higher reflectance (reduced absorption) from 600 to 740 nm, where PCE- 10 absorbs most strongly, and C60- has no absorption. This is direct evidence of an "optical spacer" effect, where Ceo-N redistributes the optical field within the device. (Kim, et al. 2006 Adv. Mater. 18, 572-576.) The loss of absorption in the photoactive layer from 600 to 740 nm explains the reduced Jsc, and lower PCE, for OPV devices with thicker interlayers. Additionally, UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy of bare metal cathodes reveals that lower PCE for devices with Cu (8.67 ± 0.17%) or Au (8.56 ± 0.21 %) cathodes, relative to Ag (9.35 ± 0.13 %) can be attributed to enhanced visible light absorption through the activation of plasmonic modes in the metal (FIG. 28). [00102] Thus, two novel fulleropyrrolidines bearing terminal tertiary amine or sulfobetaine functionalities were prepared and found to open new routes to high efficiency devices in conjunction with numerous active layer and electrode materials. Standard single-junction PSCs fabricated utilizing Οβο- and C60-SB as buffer layers provided very high PCE values for such conventional devices, and unprecedented efficiency (9.78%) for Ag cathode devices. It was also shown that PCEs exceeding 8.5% were obtained irrespective of the cathodes work-function, even for the high work function Au (F = 5.1 eV), indicating a universal utility of these interlayers. UPS revealed that a "pinning" of the work- function at 3.65 eV is likely responsible for the observed cathode independent Voc values (~ 0.75 V) as well as for significantly improved Jsc and FF values. Further, UPS, charge mobility measurements, and reflectance spectroscopy explain the origin of the higher efficiency in devices using Ceo- over C60-SB buffer layers, of the apparent insensitivity of device performance (PCE > 6 %) to interlayer thicknesses (~5 - 55 nm), and of the exceptional performance of OPV devices with an Ag cathode (PCE = 9.35 ± 0.13 %) in comparison to those with a Cu (8.67 ± 0.17 %) or Au cathode (8.56 ± 0.21 %). The synthetic accessibility of Ceo- and C60-SB, along with their ability to provide highly efficient OPVs independent of the cathode material, makes these fulleropyrrolidines excellent candidates across organic electronic platforms. [00103] Also demonstrated herein is the dual utility of C60-SB acting as a thickness insensitive cathode modification layer and electron acceptor in efficient iPSCs, while demonstrating its applicability to large area, room temperature, all-solution processed fabrication techniques with slot- die coating. [00104] Certain conjugated polymer zwitterions (CPZs) containing pendent sulfobetaine (SB) groups were recently developed. CPZs provide large negative A values (-0.5 eV to -0.9 eV) on metal substrates, and have demonstrated effectiveness as interlayers in PSCs over a thickness range of ~5 to 10 nm. (Page, et al. 2012 Macromolecules. 46, 344; Page, et al. 2014 J. Polym. Sci. Part A: Polym. Chem. 53, 327; Liu, et al. 2013 Adv. Mater. 25, 6868.) However, zwitterionic-substituted fullerenes, intrinsic n-type materials, reduce device sensitivity to ETL thickness. (Page, et al. 2014 Science 346, 441.) For example, the tris(sulfobetaine)-substituted fullerene (C60-SB) is advantageous for its good solubility in trifluoroethanol (TFE), and insolubility in solvents used for processing active layers, such as chlorinated aromatics. [00105] The present invention allows dual utility of C60-SB in acting as a thickness insensitive cathode modification layer and electron acceptor in efficient iPSCs and enables applicability to large area, room temperature, all-solution processed fabrication techniques with slot-die coating. [00106] iPSCs were fabricated by coating C6o-SB directly onto ITO substrates (FIG. 29). The BHJ active layer, containing a blend of [6,6]-phenyl C7i-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor and the low band gap conjugated polymer PCE-10 as the donor, was then coated onto a C60- SB ETL (FIG. 29, chemical structures found in supporting information, FIG. 35). Molybdenum oxide was applied by evaporative deposition, followed by silver as the anode. The optimized iPSCs fabricated with bare ITO cathodes gave PCE values of 1.96 ± 0.07% (maximum PCE 2.05%) (FIG. 30A, Table 5). In stark contrast, devices containing a C60-SB ETL yielded PCE values of 9.08 ± 0.05% (maximum PCE 9.23%) (FIG. 30A and Table 5). This dramatic improvement in PCE stems from higher open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) values, while devices without the C60-SB interlayers (i.e., with bare ITO cathodes) suffer from the high intrinsic work function of ITO and the resultant weak built-in electrostatic potential difference. In addition, ambient stability of the iPSCs was studied and compared to PSCs with a conventional geometry containing a C6o-SB/Ag cathode. Unencapsulated devices were removed from the glove box for 24-48 hour periods, and brought back into the glove box for testing, which revealed dramatically improved stability for iPSCs relative to those with a conventional geometry (FIG. 30B).

As shown in FIG. 30C, Voc, FF and PCE improved steadily with increasing ETL thickness. For an ETL thickness of 1.8 nm, the Voc values are 0.71 ± 0.006 V, FF values are 49.3 ± 1.72 %, and PCE values are 6.33 ± 0.25 %, while an ETL thickness of 40 nm results in Voc values of 0.76 ± 0.004 V, FF values of 66 ± 0.63 %, and PCE values of 9.08 ± 0.05 %, respectively. Interestingly, both Voc and FF were largely maintained even when the ETL thickness was 140 nm, surpassing the thickness of the BHJ photoactive layer (-100 nm). However, the short circuit current density (Jsc) exhibited a very different trend from Voc and FF (FIG. 30C). Below an ETL thickness of 40 nm, Jsc maintained a constant value of -18 mA/cm2. Surprisingly, with increased ETL thickness from 40 to 140 nm, the Jsc gradually decreased to ~17 mA/cm2, which explains the modest decrease in PCE from 9.08 % (-40 nm ETL) to 8.15 % (-140 m ETL) for these devices. Overall, an excellent device tolerance to ETL thickness is observed, and high PCE is maintained. [00108] An increase in the series resistance (Rs), from 5.57 ± 0.37 Ω-cm2 (-40 nm ETL) to 7.73 ± 0.84 Ω-cm2 (-140 nm ETL), is partly responsible for the observed reduction in Jsc for devices with thicker ETLs (FIG. 30C, Table 5). The increased absorption by the thicker C60-SB layer also leads to current loss, reflected in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements (FIG. 31A), where a decrease of EQE is observed below 500 nm. UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy (FIG. 31B) probed the redistribution of the optical field within devices containing different ETL thicknesses. Increasing ETL thickness (from 2 to 70 nm) led to decreased reflectance (enhanced absorption) from 475 to 575 nm, where C60-SB has negligible absorption. Correspondingly, EQE was greater over this wavelength range for the same device structure. Although the enhanced absorption contributes to the overall Jsc, a competing increase in reflectance (reduced absorption) from 600 to 740 nm, where PCE-10 absorbs most strongly, was found for devices containing ETLs thicker than 30 nm. Hence, the suppressed absorption in the 600 to 740 nm range for devices having thicker ETLs is responsible for the reduced Jsc. [00109] To further understand the working mechanism of C60-SB as an ETL in iPSCs, C60-SB/ PCE-10 bilayer devices (FIG. 32) were prepared by coating pure PCE-10 directly onto C60-SB. These bilayer devices gave Voc values of 0.82 ± 0.008 V, Jsc values of 3.46 ± 0.05 mA/cm2, FF values of 63.7 ± 0.47 %, and PCE values of 1.80 ± 0.03 % (FIG. 36). The working OPV bilayer devices, in which PCE- 10 functions as the donor layer and C60-SB as the acceptor layer, demonstrates the capability of the C60-SB/PCE-IO interface to effectively separate excitons into free charges, while C60-SB acting as a cathode modification layer (FIG. 32). To elucidate whether these mechanisms pertain to the BHJ iPSCs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to probe the composition of the bottom BHJ interface that contacts C60-SB (FIG. 37). This was accomplished by selectively dissolving C60-SB with TFE, followed by flipping the BHJ film and placing it onto a substrate for XPS analysis. Significant "F ls", "Sis", and "S2p" signals were observed, indicating that the bottom of the BHJ layer (in contact with C60-SB) contains PCE-10 (~30 wt% by integration) (FIG. 37). Therefore, this contact functions as a bilayer solar cell, where the C60-SB interlayer also serves as the acceptor, contributing to the overall device performance (FIG. 32). Hence, these iPSCs function is expected to function like two single junction devices (BHJ and bilayer) in parallel, where excitons generated in the PCE-10 phase migrate to the polymer/PC7iBM and polymer/C6o-SB interfaces, then dissociate into free electrons and holes (FIG. 32). (Yang, et al. 2012 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 134, 5432.) Holes transport through polymer channels to the anode and electrons generated in the BHJ transport through the PC71BM enriched domains to the C60-SB interlayer, then through the C60-SB layer in conjunction with electrons generated at the polymer/C6o-SB interface, which are collected by the ITO cathode. The thickness insensitivity is attributed to this dual functionality of the C60-SB layer. In addition, the higher relative dielectric constant of C60-SB (ε = 5.0) is expected to suppress bimolecular (non-geminate) recombination, mitigating space charge effects, while simultaneously decreasing the exciton binding energy at the polymer/ C60-SB interface. (Koster, et al. 2012 Adv. Energy Mater. 2, 1246; Cho, et al. 2014 Adv. Energy Mater. 4, 1301857.) Table 6.

Data is shown in Table 6 (in atomic fractions) for C60-SB on ITO (take-off angle 15° - 45°; detection depth 1 - 2.5 nm). For an ETL thickness of 2 nm, the signal arising from ITO (In3p3, In3d3, and In4d) can be detected even at a take-off angle of 15° (detection depth 1 - 1.5 nm), indicating incomplete C60- SB coverage. Increasing the C60-SB layer thickness to ~5 nm causes the signal from the ITO to vanish, suggesting full coverage by C60-SB. For the fully covered samples, a gradient in element composition was found, as shown in Table 6. Increasing the take-off angle from 15° to 45° resulted in a decrease in the atomic fraction of carbon, while the relative amount of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur increased. Since fullerene has a diameter of ~1 nm, comparable to the detection depth increment from a take-off angle of 15° - 45°, the observed changes in element composition must arise from the preferential orientation of the zwitterionic sulfobetaine chains towards the ITO surface. To complement XPS, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to characterize the electronic effect of C60-SB on ITO (FIG. 33B). The high energy region of the UPS provides interfacial dipole (A) values that reflect the difference in the high binding energy onsets, or ESEC, of bare vs. coated ITO. UPS characterization of C60-SB on ITO showed that a ~5 nm thick layer of C60- SB had the largest A = 0.6 eV (FIG. 33B), and this remained relatively constant with increasing C60- SB film thickness (even > 50 nm). A lower A value was observed for the 1.8 nm thick films, which likely arises from incomplete coverage, in accord with XPS results. The large negative A value for films > 1.8 nm in thickness increases the built-in electrostatic potential difference in the device, improving charge extraction and reducing recombination losses, consistent with the high Jsc and FF values of the devices. Similar to CPZs, work function modification of ITO by C60-SB may arise from orientation of the permanent dipole at the interface, due to the preferential interactions of the sulfobetaine zwitterion with the ITO surface. (Liu, et al. 2013 Adv. Mater. 25, 6868; Page, et al. 2014 Science 346, 441.) [001 1 1] Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed the surface of the bare ITO with a root-mean- squared (RMS) roughness of 0.65 nm (FIG. 34A). After coating with C6o-SB (~ 40 nm thick), the surface roughness decreased to 0.21 nm (FIG. 34B), indicating the presence of a continuous film of C60-SB; this may also contribute to improved device performance due to the good film-forming property of C60-SB on ITO. To investigate solvent resistance of C60-SB films, common solvents (chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene) were used in washing steps of C60-SB on glass. UV -visible absorption (FIG. 34C) shows that these solvents neither remove the films nor modify their electronic signature. Furthermore, the interfacial properties between the BHJ active layer and C60-SB layer was investigated by cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FIG. 34D). The C60-SB layer was prepared by spin-coating an 8 mg/ml C60-SB solution in TFE onto UV- ozone treated silicon wafers, affording a film thickness of ~40 nm. A sharp interface between the active layer and C60-SB layer was found indicating that C60-SB and the active layer do not interdiffuse (FIG. 38). [001 12] The orthogonal solubility of C60-SB with the photoactive layer, combined with excellent thickness tolerance, opens the potential for roll-to-roll (R2R) and slot-die processing. The compatibility of slot-die coating processes with C60-SB was investigated using the mini-slot die coater shown in FIG. 39A. A detailed description on the components and working mechanism of this coater is given elsewhere. (Liu, et al. 2014 Adv. Mater., DOI: 10.1002/adma.201404040.) During the slot-die coating process, a C60-SB solution was first injected onto a pre-cleaned ITO substrate through the slot-die head using a conventional syringe pump. Uniform films of C60-SB (~ 35 nm) on ITO were obtained over large areas with a RMS roughness of 0.32 nm as measured by AFM (FIG. 39B, FIG. 40), followed by directly slot-die coating an active layer film (PCE-10:PC7iBM, 120 nm) onto the C60-SB ETL. The present method demonstrates how both a C60-SB ETL and photoactive layer can be concurrently coated by slot-die to obtain uniform thin films over a large area. Preliminary photovoltaic performance testing of these devices has thus far been performed with an illumination area of 0.1 1 cm2, resulting in PCEs of 7.38 %, with further device optimization and large-area testing currently under way (FIG. 39C, FIG. 39D). This is believed to be the first report of an organic ETL used in a large area slot-die coating process. In addition, this solution processible ETL can be used without post-processing treatment, indicating its potential compatibility with fast and mass-production processes. [001 13] In summary, high performance iPSCs were successfully fabricated with an organic ETL composed of zwitterionic fullerenes. PCEs as high as 9.23 % were achieved with an ETL thickness of ~40 nm. Exceptional insensitivity to the ETL thickness, from 5 nm to 140 nm, was found, with PCEs exceeding 8 % across the entire thickness range. C60-SB layers function both as electron acceptor and cathode modification layers in iPSC devices. This dual role of the zwitterionic fullerene contributes to the ETL thickness insensitivity of device performance, which is an important and unique property of C60-SB. XPS and UPS showed that a C60-SB thickness of ~5 nm is necessary for full coverage of an ITO substrate, where upon the work function of ITO was decreased by -0.6 eV. The orthogonal solubility of C60-SB and the active layer, coupled with its thickness insensitivity, enabled slot-die preparation of iPSCs with PCEs of 7.38 % effectively, opening a new route to efficient large area devices that can be fabricated at room temperature. [001 14] It was found that a mixture of functional fullerenes, specifically amine-substituted Ceo and C70, gives excellent results when used as interlayers in solar cell fabrication. The C60 C70 mixture represents an inexpensive alternative (about 25% of the cost) relative to the preparation of substituted pure C60, using identical chemical transformations. Moreover, this approach varies, albeit slightly, the composition of matter of the interlayer. Spectroscopic characterization of the commercial C60 C70 materials indicate an approximately 3 :2 ratio of C60 to C70 in the mixture, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry confirms the presence of each amine-substituted structure in the mixture. The fullerene mixture is electronically similar to the pure Ceo and C70 compounds, as seen by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy to have similar ionization potential and work function reduction of Ag. Solar cells containing the mixed fullerenes as the cathode modification layer are equally efficient to those containing the pure Ceo interlayer. FIG. 41 describes the synthesis of amine-substituted mixed Ceo C70 fullerenes, comparative device data, spectroscopic evidence of the similar electronic properties between the pure Ceo and mixed fullerene structures.

OPV Device Fabrication and Characterization [00122] Photovoltatic devices were fabricated by spin coating poly(ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (H.C. Starck, I 4083) onto pre-cleaned, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (10 Ω/ , from Thin Film Devices, Inc.). PEDOT:PSS was baked at 150 °C for 30 minutes, and transferred to the glove box (N2 atmosphere, < 1 ppm O2, <1 ppm H20) for photoactive layer deposition. A mixture of PCE-10 and PC71BM (1 :2 weight ratio) or PTB7 and PC71BM (1 : 1.5 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene: l,8-diiodoocatane (2.5 v% DIO) was stirred at 80 °C for ~1 day. The photoactive layers were deposized by spin-coating the mixture solution onto the prepared substrates. The thickness of the active layer film after spin-coating was -100 (determined by profilometry, Table 3). DIO was removed under vacuum, and the devices were placed in a glove box for spin-coating of Οβο- or C60-SB and thermal evaporation of metal electrode through a shadow mask. Film thickness was measured by KLA-TENCOR Alpha-Step IQ Surface Profiler. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-meter under simulated AM1.5G irradiation using a 300 W Xe lamp solar simulator (Newport 91 160). The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si reference solar cell and KG-5 filter. The illuminated area (0.03025 cm2) was defined by using a photomask with an aperture the area of which was tested by NREL. [00123] In another experiment, the indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (20 ± 5 ohms/square) were bought from Thin Film Devices Inc., and were cleaned through ultrasonic treatment in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then dried in an oven overnight. The substrates were transferred into a glove box (N2 atmosphere, < 1 ppm O2, <1 ppm H20). C60-SB solution (2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol) with different concentration (from 0.25 mg/ml to 30 mg/ml) was spin-coated (4000 rpm, 60 s) onto ultraviolet ozone-treated ITO substrates to obtain film thickness from 1.8 nm to 139.2 nm. The thicknesses were determined by taking an average of thickness values over the absorption wavelength region, given pre-determined attenuation coefficients (cm"1).'401 A mixture of PCE-10 and PC71BM (1 : 1.8 weight ratio) in chlorobenzene: l,8-diiodoocatane (3.2 v% DIO) was stirred at 80 °C for ~1 day. The photoactive layers were deposited by spin-coating BHJ solution onto C60-SB layer or bare ITO substrate. The thickness of the active layer film was -100 nm (determined by profilometry). DIO was removed under vacuum, followed by thermal evaporation of M0O3 and metal electrode through a shadow mask created four devices on each substrate. Performance characteristics of those devices were averaged. The overlap between the bottom ITO electrode and the top metal electrode defined the maximum available device area of 0.06 cm2. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured in a 2 atmosphere using a Keithley 2400 source-meter under simulated AM1.5G irradiation using a 300 W Xe lamp solar simulator (Newport 91 160). The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si reference solar cell and KG-5 filter. The illuminated area (0.05255 cm2) was defined by a photomask with an aperture, the area of which was measured at NREL, and used in all reported PCE measurements.
