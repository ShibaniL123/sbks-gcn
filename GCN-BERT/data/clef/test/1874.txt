Example 75
2-Cyanoethyl (N-(O-(5-(3,4,6-O-triacetyl-2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-β-D-galactopyranosyl)oxy)pentanoyl)-4-(((4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)oxy)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)methyl N,N-diisopropylamidophosphite 31i
Compound 27i (0.990 g, 1.0 mmol) and 2-cyanoethyl N,N,N',N'-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite (0.316 g, 1.05 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (20 mL), and the mixture was shaken with flame-dried molecular sieves 4 Å for 1 h. This was cooled to −10° C., 1H-tetrazole (0.45M, 0.40 mmol, 0.889 mL) in acetonitrile was added, and the mixture was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was quenched with triethylamine (0.5 mL) and diluted with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The product was extracted with DCM, the organic extract was dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated to dryness. The crude product was purified on a silica gel column (5% Et3N, 5-45% of ethyl acetate in hexanes) to yield 31i (1.097 g, 92.2%) as a white solid foam.
