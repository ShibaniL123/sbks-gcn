TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a polyester coating composition assuring an extended duration of stain deposition inhibiting property, particularly to a polyester coating composition suitable as coatings for building materials, construction, automobiles and electric appliances and as a heavy duty coating. BACKGROUND ART So far, polyester coatings are used in many cases for outdoor coating of roofs and walls, especially for coating of a metal plate called pre-coat metal (PCM) which is processed after the coating. This is because polyester coatings are excellent in processability, transparency, curability and coloring property. However, recently as environmental changes such as air pollution advance, a lot of oil droplets and dusts have come to be contained in the air, and as a result, there are problems that coating films on building materials and automobiles are easily stained more than before and such stains are difficult to remove. Accordingly, coating films formed are demanded to have property of inhibiting deposition of outdoor stains for a long period of time from an initial stage of coating. For improving such property of inhibiting deposition of stains, there have been developed techniques of blending a silane compound to a coating composition to make a coating film surface hydrophilic, thus making hydrophobic stains to be hardly deposited, and further removing deposited stains with flowing raindrop or the like (WO 94/06870, JP4-275379A, U.S. Pat. No. 6,486,239 and JP7-82520A). However, a degree of hydrophilization of a coating film surface and repeatability thereof are still insufficient, long-term property of inhibiting deposition of stains is not always secured, and a large amount of silane compound is required for making a coating film surface hydrophilic. As a result, coatings are not satisfactory from the viewpoint of curability, compatibility, re-coatability, storage stability, a life (pot life) from mixing to coating, anti-floating property, defoaming property, workability in coating and processability of a coating film. Also, there are known techniques of using an additive prepared by modifying a silicate compound with fluorine for the purpose of exhibiting hydrophilic property from an initial stage of coating (WO 96/26254, JP2001-151970A and JP11-333992A). However, any of the mentioned techniques are not satisfactory from the viewpoint of re-coatability, storage stability, pot life, defoaming property, workability in coating and processability of a coating film. Especially, hydrophilic property and property of inhibiting deposition of stain of an obtained coating film are greatly lowered because a pot life is short and hydrolysis occurs in the coating composition before coating and gelling starts due to condensation unless coating is initiated soon after blending of a coating. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a polyester coating composition having excellent action of preventing deposition of outdoor stain and stain resulting from rainfall and being capable of extending a life (pot life) from the mixing to the coating. Namely, the present invention relates to a coating composition comprising: (A) a polyester resin, (B) at least one of fluorine-containing organosilicon compound having a fluorine content of 5 to 30% by mass and represented by the formula (I). wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and each is an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms which may have hetero atom and may have polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond at its end; “n” is an integer of 1 to 30; at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 has fluorine atom, (C) at least one of aliphatic hydrocarbon compound having hydroxyl group and 1 to 10 carbon atoms, in which a part of hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atom may be substituted by fluorine atoms and/or at least one of alkoxy compound having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, in which a part of hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atom may be substituted by fluorine atoms, and (D) an organic solvent. In the present invention, it is preferable that the fluorine content of the fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (B) is 7 to 20% by mass, from the viewpoint of satisfactory concentration at a coating film surface and hydrolyzability and since a pot life is extended satisfactorily. In the present invention, when 5 to 95% by mass of the fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (B) is replaced by a non-fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (G), namely, when the fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (B) and the non-fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (G) are used together, there can be provided a coating composition being excellent in a degree of hydrophilization and property of inhibiting deposition of stains and having reduced fluorine content in the whole composition. In the present invention, it is preferable that fluorine atom is not contained in the aliphatic hydrocarbon compound and/or the alkoxy compound (C) since solubility in the organic solvent is satisfactory. In the present invention, it is preferable that the aliphatic hydrocarbon compound and/or the alkoxy compound (C) is a non-fluorine-containing alcohol or a non-fluorine-containing alkoxy compound, from the viewpoint of satisfactory effect of further extending a pot life.

In the present invention, it is preferable that the fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (B) is contained in an amount of 0.01 to 40 parts by mass and the aliphatic hydrocarbon compound and/or alkoxy compound (C) is contained in an amount of 0.01 to 500 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the polyester resin (A), and the amount of organic solvent (D) is an amount to provide a solid content of 0.1 to 90% by mass. In the present invention, it is preferable that the polyester resin (A) is a polyester resin having functional group and the composition further comprises a curing agent (E) for curing the resin, from the viewpoint that strength and hardness, durability and water resistance of a coating film are satisfactory. In the present invention, it is preferable that the polyester resin (A) is a polyester resin having hydroxyl group and the curing agent (E) is an amino resin curing agent since a curing time can be shortened. In the present invention, it is preferable that the curing agent (E) is contained in an amount of 5 to 150 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the polyester resin (A), since proper time for curing is assured and balance between hardness and flexibility is satisfactory.

Each component is explained below. (A) Polyester Resin The polyester resin is a product (esterification product) obtained by condensation polymerization reaction of a polybasic acid component and a polyalcohol component. Example of a polybasic acid component to be used mainly is at least one of dibasic acid selected from phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, succinic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid and maleic anhydride or lower alkyl ester compound of these acids. If necessary, a monobasic acid such as benzoic acid, crotonic acid or p-t-butylbenzoic acid may be used together. Examples of a polyalcohol component to be used mainly are polyalcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, neopentylglycol, 3-methylpentanediol, 1,4-hexanediol and 1,6-hexanediol. These polybasic acid components and polyalcohol components can be used alone or can be used in a mixture of two or more thereof. The condensation polymerization reaction (esterification reaction or transesterification) of the polybasic acid component with the polyalcohol component can be carried out by a known method. In the present invention, for improving strength, hardness, durability and water resistance of a coating film, it is preferable that the polyester resin has functional group. The functional group has action of not only providing cure site but also improving adhesion to substrates such as metals and ceramics. Examples of such a functional group are hydroxyl group and carboxyl group. For introducing functional group to the polyester resin, known methods are used. For example, carboxyl group can be introduced by using trivalent or more polybasic acid such as trimellitic anhydride, methylcyclohexene tricarboxylic acid or pyromellitic dianhydride together as a part of polybasic acid components. Also, hydroxyl group can be introduced by using trivalent or more polyalcohol such as trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane or pentaerythritol together as a part of polyalcohol components. Further, the polyester resin may be one modified with fatty acid of fat and oil (so-called alkyd resin), modified polyester resins such as urethane-modified polyester resin and epoxy-modified polyester resin, and further silicone-modified polyester polyol resin. The polyester resin modified with fatty acid of fat and oil is one obtained by reaction of a fatty acid of fat and oil in addition to the polybasic acid component and the polyalcohol component of the polyester resin having or not having the above-mentioned functional group.

Examples of epoxy-modified polyester resin are reaction products obtained by addition reaction, condensation reaction or graft reaction of the polyester resin having functional group with an epoxy resin by using a polyester resin prepared from each component to be used for preparation of the above-mentioned polyester resin having functional group, such as reaction products obtained by reaction of carboxyl group of the polyester resin having functional group with an epoxy-containing resin, and reaction products obtained by bonding hydroxyl group in the polyester resin having functional group to hydroxyl group in an epoxy resin via a polyisocyanate compound. In these epoxy-modified polyester resins, it is preferable that an amount of modification with epoxy resin is 0.1 to 30% by mass based on the epoxy-modified polyester resin, from the viewpoint of satisfactory flexibility, adhesion and impact resistance. Preferred polyester resin (A) is one having a number average molecular weight of not less than 1,000, further not less than 2,000, from the viewpoint of satisfactory strength, durability, water resistance and processability of a coating film, and one having a number average molecular weight of not more than 50,000, further not more than 30,000, from the viewpoint of satisfactory dispersibility, solubility in the solvent and viscosity at coating.

Silicone-modified polyester polyol resin is synthesized, for example, by condensation reaction of a polyester resin having hydroxyl group with an intermediate of silicone having alkoxysilyl group or silanol group. Also silicone-modified polyester polyol resin can be prepared by adding an intermediate of silicone such as a reactive silicone oligomer having hydroxyl group or carboxyl group to a polyalcohol and a polybasic acid to be used as a starting material for preparing polyester and then conducting condensation polymerization at 220° to 280° C. Examples of a usable intermediate of silicone are phenyl-modified dimethyl silicone having hydroxyl group and phenyl-modified dimethyl silicone having alkoxysilyl group. In these silicone-modified polyester polyol resins, it is preferable that an amount of resin modification with silicone is 0.1 to 50% by mass based on the silicone-modified polyester polyol resin, from the viewpoint of satisfactory weather resistance, flexibility and resistance to salt water. Among these, polyester resins having hydroxyl group or carboxyl group as functional group are preferred from the viewpoint of satisfactory curability of a coating film.

In the case where the polyester resin (A) is a curable polyester resin having a curable functional group, it is preferable to undergo curing by using the curing agent (E) together. The curing agent may be optionally selected from known curing agents depending on kind of a curable functional group.

After the preparation, the prepared coating compositions were allowed to stand for five minutes (0 hour) and eight hours, respectively and were coated on the Substrate 1 in the same manner as in Example 1, followed by three-minute drying with a dryer of 230° C. to prepare coated sheets. By using these coated sheets, degree of hydrophilization and stain-proof property of the coating films in the exposure were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 1. In the exposure test, the coated sheets were subjected to exposure for 29 days, and degree of hydrophilization was measured after 60-hour dipping in water.

There is no big difference in characteristics between the amount of butanol of 10% by mass and the amount of butanol of 20% by mass based on the composition. Example 5 Coating compositions were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that kinds of the fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (B) and the component (C) were changed as shown in Table 5. After the preparation, the prepared coating compositions were allowed to stand for five minutes (0 hour) and eight hours, respectively and were coated on the Substrate 1 in the same manner as in Example 1, followed by three-minute drying with a dryer of 230° C. to prepare coated sheets. By using these coated sheets, degree of hydrophilization (dipping for 60 hours) and stain-proof property in the exposure (exposure for 33 days) of the coating films were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 1, and further, appearance of the coating films was evaluated by the following method. The results are shown in Table 5. (Appearance of Coating Film) Each coating composition was coated on a glass sheet with a No. 30 bar coater and air-dried, and a state of the coating films is observed with naked eyes immediately after the coating (initial stage), eight hours after and 48 hours after, respectively.

Δ: Gloss is lowered and there are a small number of nibs. X: Gloss is lowered and there are a lot of nibs. From Table 5, it is seen that as the fluorine content of component (B) increases, degree of hydrophilization is decreased (contact angle increases) as time for allowing to stand elapses after the preparation of the coating compositions. By the addition of the component (C) (butanol), duration of hydrophilization is improved. Example 6 Coating compositions were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that kinds of the fluorine-containing organosilicon compound (B) and the component (C) were changed as shown in Table 6. After the preparation, the prepared coating compositions were allowed to stand for five minutes (0 hour), and were coated on the Substrate 1 in the same manner as in Example 1, followed by three-minute drying with a dryer of 230° C. to prepare coated sheets. By using these coated sheets, degree of hydrophilization and stain-proof property of the coating films in the exposure were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 1. The coated sheets were subjected to exposure for 29 days in the exposure test, and degree of hydrophilization was measured after 60-hour dipping in water.

Even when the fluorine-containing silicon compound is replaced by an organosilicon compound up to 50% by mass, sufficient hydrophilic property and stain deposition inhibiting property can be obtained. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY According to the coating composition of the present invention, a polyester coating composition being excellent in an action of inhibiting deposition of outdoor stain and stain caused by raindrop and being capable of extending a pot life can be provided. More specifically the following effects are exhibited. Since the organosilicon compound (B) is modified with fluorine, it easily migrates to a surface of a coating film and hydrophilic property is exhibited from an initial stage, thereby enabling stain deposition inhibiting property to be exhibited from an initial stage. Even if the amount of organosilicon compound (B) is decreased, since excellent stain deposition inhibiting property is exhibited, transparency, water resistance, chemical resistance, weather resistance and processability of a coating film are not lowered. Pot life of the coating composition after the preparation thereof is extended due to the presence of the aliphatic hydrocarbon compound having hydroxyl group and/or alkoxy compound (C), and therefore, an allowance of time for coating can be provided. Effects are not limited to those mentioned above, and effects explained in Examples are also exhibited. 1.
