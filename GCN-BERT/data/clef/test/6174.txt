This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application no. 60/954,698, filed August 8, 2007. 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to kinase inhibitors, compositions comprising them, and methods of their use to treat various diseases and disorders. 2. BACKGROUND Protein kinases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to a recipient protein. The human genome is estimated to encode in excess of 500 distinct protein kinases, of which many have been implicated in a wide range of diseases and disorders, including cancer and inflammation. The LIM kinases (LIMK) have been linked to the p53 pathway. See, e.g., International Application No. WO 02/099048. LIMK belongs to a small subfamily of kinases with a unique combination of two N-terminal LIM motifs and a C-terminal protein kinase domain. These LIM motifs and kinase domains are linked by a proline- and serine-rich region containing several putative casein kinase and map kinase recognition sites. LIM kinases and their pathway proteins are believed to contribute to Rho-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Id. Members of the LIM kinase family include LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) and LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2). Both phosphorylate cofilin and regulates Rho family-dependent actin cytoskeletal rearrangement. Id. LIM kinase inhibitors have been proposed for the treatment of cancer. Id. It has also been suggested that LIMK inhibitors may be useful in treating glaucoma, by promoting actin depolymerization in trabecular cells and lowering ocular tension. See International Application No. WO 04/047868. An enormous number of compounds, with a wide variety of chemotypes, have been reported as kinase inhibitors. For example, phenyl-substituted pyrimidine compounds have been disclosed that are reportedly useful as LIMK inhibitors. See International Application WO 2006/084017. Pyrrole[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based compounds have been disclosed as Janus Kinase 3 inhibitors. See, e.g., U.S. patent publication no. 2004/0058922. Some pyrrole[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based have also been disclosed among a wide variety of other compounds as potential AKT protein kinase inhibitors. SeeU.S. patent publication no. 2005/0130954. Some pyrrole[2,3-d]pyrimidine-based kinase inhibitors are reportedly useful in the treatment of cancer. SeeU.S. patent application no. 11/354,636, filed February 15, 2006. 3.

Others are well-known in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. (Mack Publishing, Easton PA: 1990) and Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th ed. (Mack Publishing, Easton PA: 1995). Unless otherwise indicated, a "potent LIMK2 inhibitor" is a compound that has a LIMK2 IC50 of less than about 250 nM. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms "prevent," "preventing" and "prevention" contemplate an action that occurs before a patient begins to suffer from the specified disease or disorder, which inhibits or reduces the severity of the disease or disorder. In other words, the terms encompass prophylaxis. Unless otherwise indicated, a "prophylactically effective amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to prevent a disease or condition, or one or more symptoms associated with the disease or condition, or prevent its recurrence. A "prophylactically effective amount" of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other agents, which provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of the disease. The term "prophylactically effective amount" can encompass an amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic efficacy of another prophylactic agent. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "stereoisomeric mixture" encompasses racemic mixtures as well as stereomerically enriched mixtures (e.g., R/S = 30/70, 35/65, 40/60, 45/55, 55/45, 60/40, 65/35 and 70/30). Unless otherwise indicated, the term "stereomerically pure" means a composition that comprises one stereoisomer of a compound and is substantially free of other stereoisomers of that compound. For example, a stereomerically pure composition of a compound having one stereocenter will be substantially free of the opposite stereoisomer of the compound. A stereomerically pure composition of a compound having two stereocenters will be substantially free of other diastereomers of the compound. A typical stereomerically pure compound comprises greater than about 80% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 20% by weight of other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 90% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 10% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 95% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 5% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 97% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 3% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, or greater than about 99% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 1% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "substituted," when used to describe a chemical structure or moiety, refers to a derivative of that structure or moiety wherein one or more of its hydrogen atoms is substituted with a chemical moiety or functional group such as, but not limited to, alcohol, aldehyde, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkenyl, alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, t-butyl), alkynyl, alkylcarbonyloxy (-OC(O)alkyl), amide (e.g. -C(O)NH-alkyl-, -alkylNHC(O)alkyl), amidinyl (e.g., -C(NH)NH-alkyl-, -C(NR)NH2), amine (primary, secondary and tertiary such as alkylamino, arylamino, arylalkylamino), aroyl, aryl, aryloxy, azo, carbamoyl (e.g., -NHC(O)O-alkyl-, -OC(O)NH-alkyl), carbamyl (e.g., CONH2, CONH-alkyl, CONH-aryl, CONH-arylalkyl), carbonyl, carboxyl, carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid anhydride, carboxylic acid chloride, cyano, ester, epoxide, ether (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy), guanidino, halo, haloalkyl (e.g., -CCl3, -CF3, -C(CF3)3), heteroalkyl, hemiacetal, imine (primary and secondary), isocyanate, isothiocyanate, ketone, nitrile, nitro, oxo, phosphodiester, sulfide, sulfonamido (e.g., SO2NH2), sulfone, sulfonyl (including alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl and arylalkylsulfonyl), sulfoxide, thiol (e.g., sulfhydryl, thioether) and urea (e.g., -NHCONH-alkyl-). Unless otherwise indicated, a "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of a disease or condition, or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms associated with the disease or condition. A "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of the disease or condition. The term "therapeutically effective amount" can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of a disease or condition, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms "treat," "treating" and "treatment" contemplate an action that occurs while a patient is suffering from the specified disease or disorder, which reduces the severity of the disease or disorder, or retards or slows the progression of the disease or disorder. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "include" has the same meaning as "include, but are not limited to," and the term "includes" has the same meaning as "includes, but is not limited to." Similarly, the term "such as" has the same meaning as the term "such as, but not limited to." Unless otherwise indicated, one or more adjectives immediately preceding a series of nouns is to be construed as applying to each of the nouns. For example, the phrase "optionally substituted alky, aryl, or heteroaryl" has the same meaning as "optionally substituted alky, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl." Unless otherwise indicated, a structure or name of a compound or genus of compounds encompasses all forms of that compound or genus of compounds, and all compositions comprising that compound or genus of compounds. It should be noted that a chemical moiety that forms part of a larger compound may be described herein using a name commonly accorded it when it exists as a single molecule or a name commonly accorded its radical. For example, the terms "pyridine" and "pyridyl" are accorded the same meaning when used to describe a moiety attached to other chemical moieties. Thus, the two phrases "XOH, wherein X is pyridyl" and "XOH, wherein X is pyridine" are accorded the same meaning, and encompass the compounds pyridin-2-ol, pyridin-3-ol and pyridin-4-ol. It should also be noted that if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or the portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it. Moreover, any atom shown in a drawing with unsatisfied valences is assumed to be attached to enough hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valences. In addition, chemical bonds depicted with one solid line parallel to one dashed line encompass both single and double (e.g., aromatic) bonds, if valences permit. 5.2. Compounds One embodiment of this invention encompasses compounds of formula I: and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein: X is O or NRA; A is cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocycle; R1 is hydrogen, ORB, N(RB)2, SRB, or alkyl, aryl, or heterocycle; R2 is hydrogen, halogen, cyano, ORB, N(RB)2, SRB, or alkyl, aryl, or heterocycle; each R3 is independently halogen or alkyl, and/or two R3S may be taken together with the ring to which they are attached to provide a cycloalkyl or heterocycle; each R4 is cyano, halogen, hydroxy, nitro, RC, ORC, N(RC)2, NHC(O)RC, C(O)RC, C(O)N(RC)2, or SO2RC; RA is hydrogen, cyano, nitro, RA1, SO2RA1, SO2NRA1, or SO2N(RA1)2; each RA1 is independently hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl, heterocycl; each RB is independently hydrogen or alkyl; each Rc is independently hydrogen, alkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl, heterocycl; n is 0-8; and m is 0-4. Particular compounds of the invention are potent LIMK2 inhibitors. Certain compounds have a LIMK2 ICso of less than 100, 75, 50, 25 or 10 nM. 5.3. Methods of Synthesis Compounds of the invention may be prepared by methods known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. patent publication nos. 2004/0058922 and 2005/0130954. Pyrrolopyrimidines may be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. See, e.g., West, J. Org. Chem. 26:4959 (1961); Aono et al., EP 0733633-B1. One approach is described in U.S. patent application no. 60/853,891, filed October 23, 2006, and shown below in Scheme 1: The resulting 4-hydroxy pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine compound is then converted to the corresponding 4-chloro compound (compound 1(a) in Scheme 2, below) using methods known in the art. See, e.g., West, J. Org. Chem. 26:4959 (1961). That compound is then used to prepare compounds of the invention, as shown below in Scheme 2: As shown in Scheme 2, the pyrrolopyrimidine 1(a) is condensed with a piperazine under suitable conditions (e.g., heating in i-PrOH) to form the substituted pyrrolopyrimidine 1(b). Treatment of this new piperazine with a suitable substituted coupling agent (e.g., an isocyanate) 1(c) produces the final compound. If desired, known can be used to transform that compound into various others encompassed by this invention. 5.4. Methods of Use This invention relates to a method of inhibiting LIMK2, which comprises contacting LIMK2 with a potent LIMK2 inhibitor. Preferred potent LIMK2 inhibitors are compounds of the invention (i.e., compounds disclosed herein). A particular embodiment relates to a method of treating, managing or preventing an inflammatory disease or disorder in a patient, which comprises administering to the patient in need thereof a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Another embodiment relates to a method of treating, managing or preventing cancer in a patient, which comprises administering to the patient in need thereof a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Another embodiment relates to a method of lowering intraocular pressure in a patient, which comprises inhibiting LIMK2 activity or expression in a patient in need thereof. In one method, LIMK2 activity is inhibited by contacting the eye of the patient with a potent LIMK2 inhibitor. Particular potent LIMK2 inhibitors are of formulae I or II. In another method, LIMK2 expression is inhibited by administering to the eye of the patient a compound (e.g., an siRNA) that inhibits the expression of LIMK2. Another embodiment relates to a method of treating, managing or preventing a diseases or disorder affecting vision in a patient, which comprises inhibiting LIMK2 activity or expression in a patient in need thereof. In one method, LIMK2 activity is inhibited by contacting the eye of the patient with a potent LIMK2 inhibitor. Particular potent LIMK2 inhibitors are of formulae I or II. In another method, LIMK2 expression is inhibited by administering to the eye of the patient a compound (e.g., an siRNA) that inhibits the expression of LIMK2. Diseases and disorders affecting vision include glaucoma, neurodegenerative diseases, and infectious diseases. 5.5. Pharmaceutical Formulations This invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of the invention. Certain pharmaceutical compositions are single unit dosage forms suitable for oral, mucosal (e.g., nasal, sublingual, vaginal, buccal, or rectal), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, bolus injection, intramuscular, or intraarterial), transdermal, topical and ophthalmic (e.g., topical, intravitreal) administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and sterile solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration. For example, oral administration requires enteric coatings to protect the compounds of this invention from degradation within the gastrointestinal tract. Similarly, a formulation may contain ingredients that facilitate delivery of the active ingredient(s) to the site of action. For example, compounds may be administered in liposomal formulations, in order to protect them from degradative enzymes, facilitate transport in circulatory system, and effect delivery across cell membranes to intracellular sites. The composition, shape, and type of a dosage form will vary depending on its use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms encompassed by this invention will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g.,Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. (Mack Publishing, Easton PA: 1990). 5.5.1. Oral Dosage Forms Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g.,Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. (Mack Publishing, Easton PA: 1990). Typical oral dosage forms are prepared by combining the active ingredient(s) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by conventional methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary. Disintegrants may be incorporated in solid dosage forms to facility rapid dissolution. Lubricants may also be incorporated to facilitate the manufacture of dosage forms (e.g., tablets). 5.5.2. Parenteral Dosage Forms Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection), intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically bypasses patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are specifically sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions. Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate. 5.5.3. Transdermal, Topical and Mucosal Dosage Forms Transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms include, but are not limited to, ophthalmic solutions, sprays, aerosols, creams, lotions, ointments, gels, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or other forms known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g.,Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. (Mack Publishing, Easton PA: 1990); and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 4th ed. (Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia: 1985). Transdermal dosage forms include "reservoir type" or "matrix type" patches, which can be applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of time to permit the penetration of a desired amount of active ingredients. Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can be used to provide transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form will be applied. Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may be used prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active ingredients of the invention. For example, penetration enhancers may be used to assist in delivering active ingredients to the tissue. The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the tissue to which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, may also be adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the polarity of a solvent carrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve delivery. Compounds such as stearates may also be added to pharmaceutical compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent. Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further adjust the properties of the resulting composition. 5.5.4. Ophthalmic Dosage Forms Compounds of the invention can be delivered to the eye using aqueous solutions, aqueous suspensions, and ointments. As those skilled in the art are aware, the ophthalmic product must be sterile in its final container to prevent microbial contamination of the eye. Preservatives may be used to maintain sterility once the container has been opened. Ophthalmic formulations also require that the pH, buffer capacity, viscosity, and tonicity of the formulation be controlled. Preferred formulations have a pH of from about 6.5 to 8.5, and a buffer capacity of from about 0.01 to 0.1. Particular formations are isotonic. Particular formations have a viscosity of from about 25 to 50 cps. Ingredients that may be used to provide safe vehicles that effectively deliver an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to its site of action are well known, but will vary depending on the physical and chemical characteristics of the API. Appropriately buffered aqueous solutions may be used for the delivery of water soluble compounds. In solution compositions, polymeric ingredients are typically used to increase the composition's viscosity. Examples of suitable polymers include cellulosic polymers (e.g., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose), synthetic polymers (e.g., carboxyvinyl polymers, polyvinyl alcohol), polysaccharides (e.g., xanthan gum, guar gum, and dextran), and mixtures thereof. See, e.g.,U.S. patent nos. 4,136,173 and 7,244,440. Suspensions may also be used to deliver compounds. Polymeric ingredients are typically used in suspension compositions as physical stability aids, helping to keep the insoluble ingredients suspended or easily redispersible. Id. Preservatives may be used to ensure the sterility of formations. Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, chlorobutanol, phenylmercuric acetate, phenylmercuric nitrate, thimerosal, methylparaben, and propyl-parabens. And antioxidants may be used to ensure the stability of formations susceptible to oxidation. Suitable antioxidants include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and thiourea. 6.

Expression and Purification of LIMK2 LIMK2 was expressed using the BAC-to-BAC® Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculovirus was made according to the manufacturer's directions as set forth in the instruction manual. Briefly, the plasmids (pFactBac1 or pFastBacHT) carrying the LIMK2 inserts were transformed into MAX efficiency DH10Bac competent E. coli to generate a recombinant bacmid. The DH10Bac E. coli host strain contains a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) with a mini-attTn7 target site and a helper plasmid, and allows generation of a recombinant bacmid following transposition between the mini-Tn7 element on the pFastBac vector and the min-attTn7 target site on the bacmid. The transposition reaction occurs in the presence of transposition proteins supplied by the helper plasmid. Cells were plated and the white colonies picked for bacmid isolation as described in the instruction manual. The isolated bacmid DNA was transfected into SF9 cells to generate a recombinant baculovirus, and virus was collected five days after transfection. Virus was amplified in T75 flasks at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2. The amplified virus was used to infect SF9 cells at a MOI 5 for protein expression. For small scale purification of the LIMK2 constructs, a 50 ml culture of Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus was used. The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 500 x g. The cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (5 volumes per gram of cells). A typical lysis buffer contains the following: 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 15mM imidazole, 1mM benzamidine, and Roche complete protease inhibitors (1 tablet per 50 ml of cell lysate). The cellular suspension was lysed by one passage through a Microfluidics Microfluidizer M-110Y at a liquid pressure of 14,000 to 20,000 psi followed by centrifugation of the lysate at 60,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was then loaded directly onto a chromatography matrix containing Cobalt ion covalently attached to nitrilotriacetic acid NTA. The chromatography matrix was equilibrated in the same buffer as the protein loading solution. The ion charged resin typically has a binding capacity equivalent to 5 to 10 mg histidine-tagged protein per my of packed resin. The amount of extract that can be loaded onto the column depends on the amount of soluble histidine-tagged protein in the extract. The column was then washed in a stepwise fashion, first with: 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 15mM imidazole, 1mM benzamidine; second, with 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 500mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mM imidazole; third, with 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mM imidazole; followed by elution with 250 mM imidazole in the same buffer. The LIMK2 protein solution was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using commercial antibodies directed to both the carboxyl terminus and internal catalytic domains of the protein. For storage purposes the protein was dialyzed into 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150mM NaCl, 0.1% BME, 0.03% Brij-35, and 50% glycerol. Large scale LIMK2 purification was done in a Wave Bioreactor (Wave Biotech) with 10L culture volumes. 10L of cell culture at 2-3 x 106 viable cells/mL were infected at an MOI=5 pfu/cell and harvested at 48 hours post infection. 6.25. In Vitro LIMK2 Inhibition Assay An in vitro assay used to identify LIMK2 inhibitors was developed. The analytical readout was the incorporation of 33P from ATP substrate into immobilized myelin basic protein coated flash plates (Perkin Elmer Biosciences), which were counted on a scintillation counter equipped with a plate reader (TopCount, Packard Bioscience, Meriden, CT). Using 384 well flat MBP flashplates, total assay volume was 50 µl. The HTS program utilized a Biomek FX for dilution. For each assay, the ingredients and conditions were as follows: 200 ng of enzyme was incubated in assay buffer (1X assay buffer contains 30 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mM DTT, and 10 mM MgCl2), 10 µM ATP, 0.2 µCi [gamma-33P]-ATP and 10 µM of potential inhibitory compound. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes, washed 3 times with 75 µl of stop/wash buffer (1X stop/was buffer contains 50 mM EDTA and 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4)), and then the plates were read on the scintillation counter. Different concentrations of staurosporine (400 nM, 200 nM, 100 nM and 50 nM; purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA)) were used as controls on each plate. 6.26. Pig Anterior Chamber Organ Culture Perfusion Assay Freshly enucleated eyes were obtained from a local slaughter house. Eyes were harvested immediately after death and placed on ice. Anterior chamber dissections were performed within 4 hours after the pig was sacrificed. To prepare the anterior segments for perfusion the eyes were first cleaned by removing all extra-orbital muscles and immersing the orbit in 1% iodine (Veterinary Products Laboratories, Phoenix, AZ) for 30 seconds. A circular incision was then made around the posterior circumference of the orbit and this posterior section of sclera including optic nerve is removed and discarded. The vitreous, retina, lens, and choroid were then carefully removed without damaging the outflow angle in the anterior portion of the eye. The inner central ring of the iris was also removed. The clean and dissected anterior chamber was then placed on the perfusion chamber. Unintended leakage from around the eye was eliminated by placing high vacuum grease (Dow Coming Corp., Midland, MI) between the distal sclera and perfusion chamber and securing the eye in place with a 4C (5/16") 3 Oz orthodontic rubber band (ORMCO Corp., Glendora, CA). Once secured the perfusion set-up is filled with the perfusion media. The perfusion media was DMEM supplemented with 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 200 units/ml penicillin G, 200 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). The media-filled perfusion set-up was then connected to the infusion tubing and programmable syringe pump. Pressure was monitored by placing a blood pressure sensor (WPI, Sarasota, FL) in-line between the syringe pump and perfusion chamber. The sensor relayed the signal through a Bridge-8 amplifier (WPI, Sarasota, FL). The amplified signal was converted to a digital read-out through a MP-100 data acquisition system (WPI. Sarasota, FL), and the data was analyzed using the AcqKnowledge software (WPI. Sarasota, FL). Any perfusion chamber set-up that could not maintain a steady pressure due to leaking was removed from the assay. Once four anterior chamber perfusion set-ups were made, the chambers were allowed to warm to 35 °C for several hours while being perfused with media at a rate of 2 µl/min. Once the perfusion set-ups were stabilized, the first control media exchange of 15 ml was performed. The exchange rate was 5 ml/min. The perfusion set-ups were then allowed to establish an overnight baseline at a flow rate of 2 µl/min. The next morning, a second control media exchange was performed in the same way. This second exchange was used to establish the 2 hour baseline for the compound study. After establishing a 2 hour baseline that does not have more than a 1 mmHg drift, the compound media exchange was performed. Compound media exchanged were performed on two of the four perfusion set-ups. The remaining perfusion set-ups received a vehicle media exchange. All exchanged were performed at a rate of 5ml/min and an exchange volume of 25 ml. After the exchange, the perfusion set-ups were perfused at a rate of 2 µl/min for at least 4 hr. Outflow facility was calculated by dividing the resultant IOP pressure (mmHg) by the flow rate (µl/min). Data were plotted as a relative difference from time zero, i.e., the time after the 2hr baseline and before the compound/vehicle exchange. 6.27. Dexamethasone-Induced Ocular Hypertension Model Twenty eight day mouse Alzet mini-osmotic pumps (DURECT Corp., Cupertino, CA) were filled with a solution of water soluble dexamethasone (dex) in PBS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) so that they would release roughly 0.1 mg of dex per day. Once the pumps were filled with the dex, the pumps were allowed to equilibrate in PBS at 37 °C for 60 hours. The equilibrated pumps were surgically placed subcutaneously on the backs of wild-type C57:129 F2 hybrid mice weighing between 25 and 35 grams. Surgical incisions were sutured with 5-0 braided silk (ROBOZ, Gaithersburg, MD) and treated with antibiotic ointment throughout the entire duration of study. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured on these mice using a TonoLab (Colonial Medical Supply Co., Franconia, NH) tonometer. Mice were mildly sedated with isoflurane and topically anesthetized with 0.5% proparacaine (Akorn, Buffalo Grove, IL) before IOP measurements were taken. Baseline IOP was measured 1 day prior to mini-pump implantation. After mini-pump implantation, IOP measurements were taken 2-3 times per week for 4 weeks. Pharmacology studies with potential ocular hypotensive compounds were performed between 21 and 28 days after implantation. 6.28. In Vivo Effects Compounds of the invention found to affect conventional outflow in the pig anterior chamber organ culture perfusion assay described above were then tested in the mouse ocular hypertensive model. As shown in Figure 1, a 100 µM solution of a compound of the invention significantly increased conventional outflow in the pig perfusion assay as compared to the vehicle control.
