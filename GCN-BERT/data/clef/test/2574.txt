TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an adhesive composition that is useful as a material for forming an adhesive layer that exhibits an excellent water barrier capability (water-blocking capability), and exhibits adhesion and holding power in a well-balanced manner, an adhesive sheet that includes an adhesive layer that is formed using the adhesive composition, and an electronic device that includes a sealing material that is formed using the adhesive composition or the adhesive sheet. BACKGROUND ART In recent years, an organic EL device has attracted attention as a light-emitting device that can emit light with high luminance through low-voltage DC drive. However, the organic EL device has a problem in that emission properties (e.g., luminance, luminous efficiency, and luminous uniformity) easily deteriorate with the passage of time. It is considered that a deterioration in emission properties occurs when oxygen, water, and the like enter the organic EL device, and cause the electrode and the organic layer to deteriorate. Methods that utilize a sealing material have been proposed in order to solve this problem. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses an organic EL device having a configuration in which a photocurable resin layer (sealing material) having humidity resistance covers an organic EL layer that is provided on a glass substrate and placed between a transparent electrode and a bottom electrode that are formed in the shape of a thin film. Patent Document 2 discloses a method that seals an organic EL device using a sealing film that is formed using a moisture-proof polymer film and an adhesive layer. An acrylic-based adhesive and an acrylic-based pressure-sensitive adhesive (hereinafter referred to as “acrylic-based adhesive and the like”) have been proposed as an adhesive and a pressure-sensitive adhesive that are used as the sealing material for the organic EL device, taking account of optical properties such as transparency. For example, Patent Document 3 discloses a UV-curable acrylic-based adhesive that can be cured at room temperature as a sealing material for an organic EL display. Patent Document 4 discloses an acrylic-based pressure-sensitive adhesive as a pressure-sensitive adhesive that can form a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer that maintains transparency even when subjected to a heat treatment and a drying treatment that are performed when producing the organic EL device in order to remove water and the like. However, a sealing material that is formed using the acrylic-based adhesive and the like has an insufficient water barrier capability, and is not suitable as a sealing material for which a very high water barrier capability is required (e.g., the sealing material for the organic EL device). When a sealing material that is formed using the acrylic-based adhesive and the like has a crosslinked structure, the sealing material may be easily delaminated from the adherend due to an impact, vibrations, heat, or the like, and the water barrier capability may deteriorate to a large extent. In recent years, an adhesive that includes a polyisobutylene-based resin has been proposed as a sealing adhesive that exhibits a good water barrier capability. For example, Patent Document 5 discloses an adhesive composition that is used as a sealing material for an organic EL display, and includes a specific hydrogenated cycloolefin-based polymer and a polyisobutylene resin. RELATED-ART DOCUMENT Patent Document Patent Document 1: JP-A-5-182759 Patent Document 2: JP-A-5-101884 Patent Document 3: JP-A-2004-87153 Patent Document 4: JP-A-2004-224991 Patent Document 5: JP-T-2009-524705 (WO2007/0087281) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Technical Problem A sealing material obtained using the adhesive composition disclosed in Patent Document 5 exhibits a good water barrier capability as compared with a sealing material obtained using an acrylic-based adhesive. However, the water barrier capability of the sealing material obtained using the adhesive composition disclosed in Patent Document 5 is insufficient when it is used as a sealing material for the organic EL device or the like. Moreover, since the balance between adhesion and holding power is poor, the sealing material may come off from the adherend, or may be delaminated from the adherend, due to heat or vibrations that occur when the device is driven, whereby the water barrier capability may deteriorate to a large extent. The invention was conceived in view of the above situation. An object of the invention is to provide an adhesive composition that is useful as a material for forming an adhesive layer that exhibits an excellent water barrier capability, and exhibits adhesion and holding power in a well-balanced manner, an adhesive sheet that includes an adhesive layer that is formed using the adhesive composition, and an electronic device that includes a sealing material that is formed using the adhesive composition or the adhesive sheet.

Among these, a polyisoprene-based rubber that includes a carboxylic acid-based functional group is preferable as the diene-based rubber (A) due to a capability to efficiently form an adhesive layer that exhibits sufficient cohesive strength after crosslinking. These diene-based rubbers may be used either alone or in combination as the diene-based rubber (A).

It is preferable to use the epoxy-based crosslinking agent as the crosslinking agent (B) since the epoxy-based crosslinking agent has high reactivity with the carboxylic acid-based functional group included in the diene-based rubber (A), and a crosslinked structure can be efficiently formed. When the crosslinking agent (B) is the epoxy-based crosslinking agent, it is possible to efficiently form an adhesive layer that exhibits sufficient cohesive strength, and is preferable as a material for forming a sealing material for an electronic device. These crosslinking agents may be used either alone or in combination as the crosslinking agent (B).

When the amount of the crosslinkable group is within the above range, it is possible to efficiently form an adhesive layer that exhibits sufficient cohesive strength. Rubber-Based Polymer (C) that does not Include Carboxylic Acid-Based Functional Group The adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention may include a rubber-based polymer (C) that does not include a carboxylic acid-based functional group (hereinafter may be referred to as “rubber-based polymer (C)”). The term “rubber-based polymer” used herein refers to a resin that exhibits rubber elasticity at 25° C. When the adhesive composition includes the rubber-based polymer (C), it is possible to form a complex and dense structure (i.e., interpenetrating polymer network structure) in which the rubber-based polymer (C) is intertwined with a crosslinked structure that is formed by the reaction between the diene-based rubber (A) and the crosslinking agent (B), and efficiently form an adhesive layer that exhibits a high water barrier capability and sufficient adhesion. When the adhesive composition includes the rubber-based polymer (C), it is possible to efficiently form an adhesive layer that exhibits adhesion and holding power in a well-balanced manner, and exhibits a high water barrier capability and sufficient cohesive strength. Therefore, it is preferable that the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention include the rubber-based polymer (C). It is preferable that the rubber-based polymer (C) be rubber that includes a polymethylene-type saturated main chain, or rubber that includes an unsaturated carbon-carbon bond in the main chain.

Among these, an isobutylene-based polymer such as an isobutylene homopolymer, a copolymer of isobutylene and n-butene, a copolymer of isobutylene and butadiene, and a copolymer of isobutylene and isoprene is preferable, and a copolymer of isobutylene and isoprene is more preferable as the rubber-based polymer (C), due to an excellent water barrier capability, high compatibility with the diene-based rubber (A), and a capability to easily form a uniform adhesive layer. These rubber-based polymers may be used either alone or in combination as the rubber-based polymer (C). The number average molecular weight of the rubber-based polymer (C) is preferably 100,000 to 2,000,000, more preferably 100,000 to 1,500,000, and still more preferably 100,000 to 1,000,000. It is possible to prepare an adhesive composition having moderate fluidity, and easily form an adhesive layer that exhibits sufficient adhesion by utilizing the rubber-based polymer (C) having a number average molecular weight of 100,000 or more. When the rubber-based polymer (C) has a number average molecular weight of 2,000,000 or less, the rubber-based polymer (C) is easily dissolved in a normal organic solvent, and it is possible to efficiently prepare the adhesive composition.

The hydrogenated resin may be a partially hydrogenated product, or may be a completely hydrogenated product. These tackifiers may be used either alone or in combination as the tackifier (D). The molecular weight (Mw) of the tackifier (D) is preferably 100 to 10,000, and more preferably 500 to 5000.

When the tackifier (D) is used in an amount of 70 parts by mass or less based on 100 parts by mass of the diene-based rubber (A) and the rubber-based polymer (C) in total, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the cohesive strength of the adhesive layer decreases. Additional Component The adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention may include an additional component as long as the advantageous effects of the invention are not impaired. Examples of the additional component include additives such as a light stabilizer, a silane coupling agent, an antistatic agent, an antioxidant, a UV absorber, a resin stabilizer, a filler, a pigment, an extender, and a softener. These additives may be used either alone or in combination. The content of each additional component in the adhesive composition is preferably 0.01 to 5 mass %, and more preferably 0.01 to 2 mass %. Adhesive Composition The adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention may be prepared by appropriately mixing and stirring the diene-based rubber (A), the crosslinking agent (B), the rubber-based polymer (C) (optional), the tackifier (D) (optional), an optional additional component, a solvent, and the like using a normal method. Examples of the solvent include an aromatic hydrocarbon-based solvent such as benzene and toluene; an ester-based solvent such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; a ketone-based solvent such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone; an aliphatic hydrocarbon-based solvent such as n-pentane, n-hexane, and n-heptane; an alicyclic hydrocarbon-based solvent such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane; and the like. These solvents may be used either alone or in combination. The solid content in the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention is preferably 10 to 60 mass %, more preferably 10 to 45 mass %, and still more preferably 15 to 30 mass %. An adhesive layer obtained by crosslinking the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention exhibits an excellent water barrier capability. Specifically, the adhesive layer having a thickness of 60 μm has a water vapor transmission rate at a temperature of 40° C. and a relative humidity of 90% of 60 g/(m2·day) or less, preferably 10 g/(m2·day) or less, still more preferably 6 g/(m2·day) or less, and yet more preferably 3 g/(m2·day) or less. The water vapor transmission rate of the adhesive layer can be controlled by adjusting the number of carboxylic acid-based functional groups included in the diene-based rubber (A), the amount of the diene-based rubber (A), the amount of the crosslinking agent (B), and the like. The water vapor transmission rate of the adhesive layer may be measured using the method described later in connection with the examples. Since the water vapor transmission rate of the adhesive layer depends on the thickness of the adhesive layer, the water vapor transmission rate of the adhesive layer is converted using the thickness of the adhesive layer when the thickness of the adhesive layer is not 60 μm. For example, when the thickness of the adhesive layer is A μm, and the water vapor transmission rate of the adhesive layer is B g/(m2·day), the water vapor transmission rate of the adhesive layer is converted using the expression “A×B/60”. 2) Adhesive Sheet An adhesive sheet according to one embodiment of the invention includes an adhesive layer that is formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention. Specific examples of the adhesive sheet according to one embodiment of the invention include an adhesive sheet (α) and an adhesive sheet (β) (see below). Adhesive sheet (α): An adhesive sheet including an adhesive layer that is formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention, and a release sheet that is provided on one side or each side of the adhesive layer Adhesive sheet (β): An adhesive sheet including an adhesive layer that is formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention, and a base sheet Adhesive Layer The adhesive layer included in the adhesive sheet (α) and the adhesive layer included in the adhesive sheet (β) are formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention. Since the adhesive layer is formed by the reaction between the diene-based rubber (A) and the crosslinking agent (B), the adhesive layer exhibits sufficient cohesive strength and an excellent water barrier capability. When the adhesive layer is formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention that further includes the rubber-based polymer (C), the adhesive layer has a complex and dense structure (i.e., interpenetrating polymer network structure) in which the polymer molecules of the rubber-based polymer (C) are intertwined with a crosslinked structure that is formed by the reaction between the diene-based rubber (A) and the crosslinking agent (B). Since the adhesive layer having such a structure exhibits sufficient cohesive strength as described later, the adhesive layer exhibits a further improved water barrier capability, and exhibits adhesion and holding power in a well-balanced manner. It is preferable to form the adhesive sheet according to one embodiment of the invention using the adhesive composition that includes the rubber-based polymer (C) since these advantageous effects can be easily obtained. The adhesive layer may be formed using an arbitrary method. For example, the adhesive layer may be formed by applying the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention to the surface of the release layer of the release sheet, or the base sheet, using a known method, and drying the resulting film. The adhesive composition may be applied using a spin coating method, a spray coating method, a bar coating method, a knife coating method, a roll coating method, a blade coating method, a die coating method, a gravure coating method, or the like. The film is dried at 80 to 150° C. for 30 seconds to 5 minutes, for example. The dried film may be allowed to stand for about 1 week to cure the adhesive layer. The crosslinked structure can be sufficiently formed by curing the adhesive layer. The thickness of the adhesive layer is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately determined taking account of the application. The thickness of the adhesive layer is preferably 0.5 to 200 μm, more preferably 1 to 100 μm, and still more preferably 5 to 80 μm. When the thickness of the adhesive layer is 0.5 μm or more, further improved adhesion can be easily obtained. When the thickness of the adhesive layer is 200 μm or less, it is possible to form the adhesive layer with high productivity. The adhesive layer exhibits an excellent water barrier capability, and exhibits adhesion and holding power in a well-balanced manner. Therefore, when the adhesive layer is used as a sealing material, it is possible to sufficiently prevent entry of water. Since the sealing material is not easily separated (delaminated) at the bonding interface even when heat or vibrations occur when the device is driven, it is possible to prevent entry of water and the like for a long time. Whether or not the adhesive layer exhibits an excellent water barrier capability is determined by measuring the water vapor transmission rate of the adhesive layer (see above). Whether or not the adhesive layer exhibits excellent adhesion is determined by measuring the adhesion of the adhesive layer. For example, when the adhesive sheet is bonded to an adherend at 23° C. and 50% RH (relative humidity), and the adhesion of the adhesive layer is measured after allowing the laminate to stand for 24 hours, the adhesion of the adhesive layer is preferably 1 N/25 mm or more when the adherend is a polyethylene terephthalate film, and 1 N/25 mm or more when the adherend is a glass sheet. Whether or not the adhesive layer exhibits excellent cohesive strength is determined by measuring the holding power of the adhesive layer. For example, when the adhesive sheet is bonded to a stainless steel sheet (SUS380) so that the bonding area is 25×25 mm to prepare a specimen, and the holding power of the adhesive sheet is measured in accordance with JIS Z 0237 (40° C., dry conditions, load: 9.8 N) using the resulting specimen, it is preferable that the adhesive sheet does not come off from the stainless steel sheet during a period of 70,000 seconds. The adhesion and the holding power of the adhesive layer may be measured using the methods described later in connection with the examples. When the adhesive sheet according to one embodiment of the invention does not include the base sheet (e.g., the adhesive sheets (1a) and (1b) described below), it is preferable that the adhesion and the holding power measured using a specimen prepared by lining the adhesive sheet with a polyethylene terephthalate film or the like be within the above ranges. Adhesive sheet (α) FIG. 1 illustrates examples of the adhesive sheet (α) according to one embodiment of the invention (see (a) and (b)). The adhesive sheet (1a) illustrated in FIG. 1 (see (a)) includes an adhesive layer (2a) that is formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention, and a release sheet (3a) that is provided on one side of the adhesive layer (2a). The adhesive sheet (1b) illustrated in FIG. 1 (see (b)) includes an adhesive layer (2b) that is formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention, and release sheets (3b) and (3c) that are provided on either side of the adhesive layer (2b). The release sheet included in the adhesive sheet (α) is not particularly limited. For example, a release sheet that includes a base, and a release layer that is provided on the base, may be used. Examples of the base used to produce the release sheet include a paper base such as glassine paper, coated paper, and high-quality paper; laminated paper obtained by laminating a thermoplastic resin (e.g., polyethylene) on such a paper base; a plastic film formed of a polyethylene terephthalate resin, a polybutyrene terephthalate resin, a polyethylene naphthalate resin, a polypropylene resin, a polyethylene resin, or the like; and the like. Examples of a release agent include a silicone-based resin, an olefin-based resin, a rubber-based elastomer (e.g., isoprene-based resin and butadiene-based resin), a long-chain alkyl-based resin, an alkyd-based resin, a fluorine-based resin, and the like. The thickness of the release sheet is not particularly limited, but is normally 20 to 200 μm, and preferably 25 to 150 μm. The release sheet may be a double-sided release sheet in which the release layer is formed on each side of the base, or may be a single-sided release sheet in which the release layer is formed on one side of the base. It is preferable to use the double-sided release sheet when producing the adhesive sheet (1a). The adhesive sheet (1a) can be wound in the shape of a roll, and stored when the double-sided release sheet is used. The adhesive sheet (1a) can be obtained by forming the adhesive layer on a first release sheet using the above method. The adhesive sheet (1b) can be obtained by bonding a second release sheet to the surface of the adhesive layer of the adhesive sheet (1a). The second release sheet may be either identical with or different from the first release sheet. It is preferable that the second release sheet require a peel force differing from that of the first release sheet from the viewpoint of workability when removing (peeling) the release sheet. Since the adhesive layer included in the adhesive sheet (α) exhibits an excellent water barrier capability, and exhibits adhesion and holding power in a well-balanced manner, the adhesive sheet (α) is preferably used to form a sealing material for an electronic device. Examples of the electronic device include an organic device such as an organic transistor, an organic memory, and an organic EL device, a liquid crystal display, electronic paper, a thin film transistor, an electrochromic device, an electrochemical light-emitting device, a touch panel, a solar cell, a thermoelectric conversion device, a piezoelectric conversion device, an electrical storage device, and the like. Among these, an organic EL device and electronic paper are preferable since it is possible to take full advantage of the characteristics of the adhesive layer. When forming a sealing material for an electronic device using the adhesive sheet (α), the adhesive layer of the adhesive sheet (α) is bonded to an adherend (e.g., the electrode of an organic EL device), the release sheet is removed, and the adhesive layer is bonded to another adherend so that the adhesive layer that exhibits excellent adhesion to the adherend and an excellent water barrier capability, and functions as a sealing material is provided on the surface of the adherend, for example. The adhesive sheet (α) may preferably be used as a material for producing the adhesive sheet (β) (described below). Adhesive sheet (β) FIG. 2 illustrates examples of the adhesive sheet (β) according to one embodiment of the invention (see (a) and (b)). The adhesive sheet (1c) illustrated in FIG. 2 (see (a)) includes an adhesive layer (2c) that is formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention, and a base sheet (4a). The adhesive sheet (1d) illustrated in FIG. 2 (see (b)) includes an adhesive layer (2d) that is formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention, a base sheet (4b), and a release sheet (3d). The base sheet included in the adhesive sheet (β) is not particularly limited as long as the base sheet can support the adhesive layer. A film or a sheet formed of a resin (e.g., polyimide, polyamide, polyamide-imide, polyphenylene ether, polyether ketone, polyether ether ketone, polyolefin, polyester (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate), polycarbonate, polysulfone, polyether sulfone, polyphenylene sulfide, polyarylate, acrylic-based resin, cycloolefin-based polymer, aromatic-based polymer, or polyurethane-based polymer), a metal foil (e.g., aluminum foil), a laminate thereof, or the like may be used as the base sheet. The thickness of the base sheet is not particularly limited, but is preferably 0.5 to 500 μm, more preferably 1 to 200 μm, and still more preferably 5 to 100 μm, from the viewpoint of ease of handling. The base sheet may include a UV absorber, a light stabilizer, an antioxidant, an antistatic agent, a slipping agent, an antiblocking agent, a coloring agent, and the like. The surface of the base sheet may optionally be subjected to a surface treatment in order to improve adhesion between the base sheet and the adhesive layer. A gas barrier layer may be formed on the base sheet either directly or through an additional layer in order to provide the base sheet with a gas barrier capability. The thickness of the gas barrier layer is not particularly limited, but is normally 10 to 2000 nm, preferably 20 to 1000 nm, more preferably 30 to 500 nm, and still more preferably 40 to 200 nm, from the viewpoint of gas barrier capability and handling capability. The gas barrier layer may include a single layer, or may include a plurality of layers. It is preferable that the gas barrier layer include a plurality of layers since a higher gas barrier capability can be obtained. A material for forming the gas barrier layer and the like are not particularly limited as long as it is possible to provide the gas barrier layer with the desired gas barrier capability. Examples of the gas barrier layer include an inorganic film, a gas barrier layer obtained by implanting ions into a layer that includes a polymer compound, a metal film (e.g., aluminum film), and the like. It is preferable that the gas barrier layer be a gas barrier layer that is formed of an inorganic film, or a gas barrier layer obtained by implanting ions into a layer that includes a polymer compound, since it is possible to efficiently form a layer that is thin, and exhibits an excellent gas barrier capability. The inorganic film is not particularly limited. Examples of the inorganic film include an inorganic deposited film. Examples of the inorganic deposited film include an inorganic deposited film obtained by depositing an inorganic compound, and an inorganic deposited film obtained by depositing a metal. Examples of the inorganic compound used as the raw material for forming the inorganic deposited film include an inorganic oxide such as silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, indium oxide, and tin oxide; an inorganic nitride such as silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, and titanium nitride; an inorganic carbide; an inorganic sulfide; an inorganic oxynitride such as silicon oxynitride; an inorganic oxycarbide; an inorganic carbonitride; an inorganic oxycarbonitride; and the like. Examples of the metal used as the raw material for forming the inorganic deposited film include aluminum, magnesium, zinc, tin, and the like. These materials may be used either alone or in combination. An inorganic deposited film that is formed using an inorganic oxide, an inorganic nitride, or a metal as the raw material is preferable from the viewpoint of gas barrier capability. An inorganic deposited film that is formed using an inorganic oxide or an inorganic nitride as the raw material is preferable from the viewpoint of transparency. The inorganic deposited film may be formed using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method such as a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method, or an ion plating method, or a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method such as a thermal CVD method, a plasma CVD method, or a photo-CVD method, for example. Examples of the polymer compound used when forming the gas barrier layer by implanting ions into the layer that includes the polymer compound (hereinafter may be referred to as “polymer layer”) include a silicon-containing polymer compound (e.g., polyorganosiloxane and polysilazane-based compound), a polyimide, a polyamide, a polyamide-imide, a polyphenylene ether, a polyether ketone, a polyether ether ketone, a polyolefin, a polyester, a polycarbonate, a polysulfone, a polyether sulfone, a polyphenylene sulfide, a polyallylate, an acrylic-based resin, a cycloolefin-based polymer, an aromatic polymer, and the like. These polymer compounds may be used either alone or in combination. Among these, a polysilazane-based compound is preferable since a gas barrier layer that exhibits an excellent gas barrier capability can be formed. A product commercially available as a glass coating material or the like may be used directly as the polysilazane-based compound. The polysilazane-based compounds may be used either alone or in combination. The polymer layer may include an additional component other than the polymer compound as long as the object of the invention is not impaired. Examples of the additional component include a curing agent, an additional polymer, an aging preventive, a light stabilizer, a flame retardant, and the like. The polymer layer may be formed by applying a layer-forming solution that includes at least one polymer compound, an optional additional component, a solvent, and the like using a known device (e.g., spin coater, knife coater, or gravure coater), and moderately drying the resulting film, for example. Examples of the ions implanted into the polymer layer include ions of a rare gas such as argon, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon; ions of a fluorocarbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, chlorine, fluorine, sulfur, and the like; ions of an alkane-based gas such as methane and ethane; ions of an alkene-based gas such as ethylene and propylene; ions of an alkadiene-based gas such as pentadiene and butadiene; ions of an alkyne-based gas such as acetylene; ions of an aromatic hydrocarbon-based gas such as benzene and toluene; ions of a cycloalkane-based gas such as cyclopropane; ions of a cycloalkene-based gas such as cyclopentene; ions of a metal; ions of an organosilicon compound; and the like. These ions may be used either alone or in combination. It is preferable to use ions of a rare gas such as argon, helium, neon, krypton, or xenon due to ease of ion implantation and a capability to form a gas barrier layer that exhibits a particularly excellent gas barrier capability. The ions may be implanted using an arbitrary method. For example, the ions may be implanted by applying ions (ion beams) accelerated using an electric field, implanting ions present in plasma (plasma ion implantation method), or the like. It is preferable to use the plasma ion implantation method since a gas barrier film can be easily obtained. The water vapor transmission rate of the gas barrier layer at 40° C. and 90% RH is preferably 0.5 g/(m2·day) or less, and more preferably 0.05 g/(m2·day) or less. The water vapor transmission rate of the gas barrier layer may be measured using a known gas transmission rate measurement apparatus. The adhesive sheet (β) may include an additional layer in addition to the adhesive layer and the base sheet. Examples of the additional layer include a protective layer, a conductive layer, a primer layer, a release sheet, and the like. The additional layer may be situated (stacked) at an arbitrary position. The adhesive sheet (β) can be obtained by forming the adhesive layer on the base sheet using the above method, or producing the adhesive sheet (1a), and bonding the adhesive layer of the adhesive sheet (1a) to the base sheet. The adhesive layer included in the adhesive sheet (β) exhibits an excellent water barrier capability, and exhibits adhesion and holding power in a well-balanced manner. Therefore, the adhesive sheet (β) exhibits excellent adhesion between the base sheet and the adhesive layer. These characteristics are particularly advantageous when using a gas barrier film that exhibits a very high gas barrier capability as the base sheet. Specifically, since the adhesive sheet (β) suppresses entry of water and the like from the bonding interface between the base sheet and the adhesive layer, the very high performance of the gas barrier film is reflected directly in the adhesive sheet (3). Therefore, the adhesive sheet (β) may preferably be used to form a sealing material for an electronic device in the same manner as the adhesive sheet (α). Examples of the electronic device include those mentioned above. In particular, an organic EL device is preferable. When forming a sealing material for an electronic device using the adhesive sheet (β), the adhesive layer of the adhesive sheet (β) is bonded to an adherend (e.g., the electrode of an organic EL device) so that the sealing material and the base sheet are provided on the surface of the adherend. The adhesive sheet according to one embodiment of the invention is useful as a material for forming a sealing material for an electronic device (described below). 3) Electronic Device An electronic device according to one embodiment of the invention includes a sealing material, the sealing material being formed using the adhesive composition according to one embodiment of the invention, or the adhesive sheet according to one embodiment of the invention. Examples of the electronic device include an organic device such as an organic transistor, an organic memory, and an organic EL device, a liquid crystal display, electronic paper, a thin film transistor, an electrochromic device, an electrochemical light-emitting device, a touch panel, a solar cell, a thermoelectric conversion device, a piezoelectric conversion device, an electrical storage device, and the like. FIG. 3 illustrates the structure of an organic EL device as an example of the electronic device according to one embodiment of the invention. An organic EL device 10 includes a glass substrate 11, and a structure 12 that is formed on the glass substrate 11. The structure 12 is formed by stacking a transparent electrode, a hole-transporting layer, an emitting layer, a bottom electrode, and the like (not illustrated in FIG. 3). An adhesive sheet 1 that includes an adhesive layer 2 and a base sheet 4 is laminated (stacked) on the structure 12 and the glass substrate 11. In this case, the adhesive composition (or a solution prepared by diluting the adhesive composition with an appropriate solvent) may be applied to the structure 12 and the glass substrate 11, and dried to form the adhesive layer 2, and the base sheet 4 may be laminated (stacked) on the adhesive layer 2. Since the organic EL device 10 is configured so that the structure 12 is covered with the adhesive layer 2, entry of water and the like is suppressed, and a situation does not occur in which the adhesive layer 2 is displaced or delaminated from the structure 12 due to heat or vibrations that occur when the electronic device is driven. In particular, when a gas barrier film that exhibits an excellent gas barrier capability is used as the base sheet 4, delamination rarely occurs at the interface between the adhesive layer 2 and the gas barrier film (base sheet 4), and it is possible to take full advantage of the performance of the gas barrier film.

Aluminum (A1) (manufactured by Kojundo Chemical Lab. Co., Ltd.) (100 nm) was deposited on the emitting layer at a deposition rate of 0.1 nm/s to form a cathode. Note that the degree of vacuum during deposition was set to 1×10−4 Pa or less. The adhesive sheet (1A) was heated at 120° C. for 30 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere using a hot plate to remove water included in the adhesive sheet (1A), and allowed to cool to room temperature. After removing the release sheet (1) from the adhesive sheet (1A), the exposed adhesive layer was laminated on the cathode so as to cover the entirety of the cathode to obtain an organic EL device (1).

The measurement results and the evaluation results are shown in Tables 1 to 3. Measurement of Water Vapor Transmission Rate After removing the release sheets (1) and (2) from the adhesive sheet ((1B) to (29B)), the adhesive sheet was bonded to a polyethylene terephthalate film (manufactured by Mitsubishi Plastics Inc., thickness: 6 μm) to obtain a water vapor transmission rate measurement sample in which the adhesive layer (thickness: 60 μm) was situated between two polyethylene terephthalate films. The water vapor transmission rate (B) of the adhesive layer was measured at 40° C. and 90% RH using a water vapor transmission rate measurement apparatus (“L80-5000” manufactured by LYSSY), and the water vapor transmission rate of the adhesive layer when the thickness of the adhesive layer is 60 μm was calculated using the following conversion formula (1). [in-line-formulae]Water vapor transmission rate when thickness is 60 μm=A×B/60 (1)[/in-line-formulae] A: Thickness of adhesive layer B: Water vapor transmission rate of adhesive layer Measurement of Adhesion The adhesive sheet ((1A) to (29A)) was cut to dimensions of 25×300 mm.

In Tables 1 to 3, a case where the adhesive sheet did not come off from the stainless steel sheet is indicated by “NC”, and a case where the adhesive sheet came off from the stainless steel sheet is indicated by “C”. The value in the parenthesis represents the amount (mm) by which the adhesive sheet came off. Water Entry Test A calcium layer having a length of 32 mm, a width of 40 mm, and a thickness of 100 nm was formed on an alkali-free glass substrate (manufactured by Corning, 45×45 mm) using a vacuum deposition method. After removing the release sheet (1) from the adhesive sheet ((1A) to (29A)), the exposed adhesive layer was bonded to the calcium layer formed on the glass substrate in a nitrogen atmosphere using a laminator to obtain a water entry test specimen in which the calcium layer was sealed. The resulting specimen was allowed to stand at 60° C. and 90% RH for 170 hours, and the degree of discoloration of the calcium layer (i.e., the degree of entry of water) was observed with the naked eye. The water barrier capability was evaluated in accordance with the following standard. Evaluation Standard A: Less than 20% (area ratio) of the calcium layer was discolored. B: 20% or more and less than 40% (area ratio) of the calcium layer was discolored. C: 40% or more (area ratio) of the calcium layer was discolored. Evaluation of Organic EL Device The organic EL device ((1) to (16)) was allowed to stand at 23° C. and 50% RH for 200 hours, and driven to observe the presence or absence of a dark spot (i.e., an area in which light was not emitted). The organic EL device was evaluated in accordance with the following standard. A: The ratio of a dark spot area was less than 5% with respect to the emission area.

An adhesive layer that exhibited a good water barrier capability and good holding power, and exhibited adhesion and holding power in a well-balanced manner could be formed using the adhesive compositions of Examples 1 to 26 (see the test results of the adhesive sheets respectively formed using the adhesive compositions of Examples 1 to 26). In particular, the adhesive sheets (1B) to (7B) of Examples 1 to 7 that were formed using the diene-based rubber (A1) and the rubber-based polymer (C1), and the adhesive sheets (17B) to (23B) of Examples 14 to 20 that were formed using the diene-based rubber (A2) and the rubber-based polymer (C1), exhibited a very good water barrier capability. The adhesive sheets (1A) to (13A) and (17A) to (29A) including the adhesive layer and the gas barrier film exhibited high performance when subjected to the water entry test, and the organic EL devices (1) to (13) respectively including the adhesive sheets (1A) to (13A), and the organic EL devices (17) to (29) respectively including the adhesive sheets (17A) to (29A), exhibited high durability. In contrast, the adhesive sheet (16B) of Comparative Example 3 that was formed using the acrylic-based adhesive had a high water vapor transmission rate, and the water barrier capability of the adhesive sheet (16A) and the durability of the organic EL device (16) were poor. The adhesive sheets (14B) and (15B) that were respectively formed using the adhesive compositions of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 had a low water vapor transmission rate, but exhibited low holding power, and the balance between adhesion and holding power was poor. Therefore, it was impossible to take full advantage of the performance of the gas barrier film, and the organic EL devices (14) and (15) exhibited poor durability.
