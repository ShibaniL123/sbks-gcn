LIPOIC ACID CHOLINE ESTER COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention generally relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof and a non-aqueous excipient and uses thereof for treating ocular diseases or disorders (e.g., presbyopia). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Presbyopia and Accommodative Amplitude [0002] As we age, our lenses undergo physiological changes that make it more difficult to focus on near objects. That is why nearly everyone requires reading glasses, even as early as ages 35-40. The ability of the eye to change focal power, also known as accommodative amplitude, decreases significantly with age. The accommodative amplitude is 20 diopters in children and young adults, but it decreases to 10 diopters by age 25 and to≤1 diopter by age 60. The age-related inability to focus on near objects is called presbyopia. All of us will develop presbyopia and will use corrective lenses unless a new treatment is found. [0003] Many factors contribute to the cause of presbyopia. A lens fiber cell fluid layer formed during accommodation by aquaporin-0 (see Fig. 1) has been implicated in presbyopia. As the diagram shows, when the ciliary muscle contracts (Helmholtz theory of accommodation), tension on the zonules is released and the potential energy stored in the lens capsule is released and creates kinetic force at the equatorial plane of the lens. As shown by finite element analysis of the lens, this force originates adjacent to the zonular lens attachments at the perilenticular equatorial position. The lens is made-up of long fiber cells with "new" cells made at the surface. These fiber cells form a microfluidic path that resemble "tubes." This works to maintain lens accommodative function. Dysfunctional "old" fiber cells are displaced inward. This provides an efficient means to move outer "fluid compartment" fluid, when zonular tension is released, toward the middle (central optical axis) of the lens to increase geometric curvature (optical power). This fluid movement is facilitated by a special phenomena similar to that reported for blood flow through microcapillaries (< 10 um). A small plasma layer (a phenomenon described by Fahraeus-Lindqvist) is formed along the periphery of blood vessels. This lowers the apparent or effective measured hematocrit viscosity and improves blood flow with lower backpressure. [0004] Within lens fiber cells (also about 10 um diameter), a similar phenomenon is apparently operational. Abundant aquaporin-0 lining the cell wall/membrane in lens fiber cells allows water flow out of the cell during accommodation for near vision focus. Dissolved micronutrients (including, therapeutic pharmaceuticals) are supplied to the lens occur through these same interstitial water channels. Additionally, part of their undocumented intrinsic function facilitates accommodative amplitude that requires aforementioned fluid movement to change lens geometry. The water layer formed along the intracellular fiber cell membrane wall reduces impedence or resistance and gives "lubrication" to the inner core cytosol protein; a previously overlooked phenomena. Although the protein core (inside the inner portion of the lens fiber cell) may have higher intrinsic viscosity, the "lubrication factor" or microlayer (< 1 nm) formed between the core and the inner membrane, significantly lowers the extrinsic viscosity (as with blood hematocrit apparent viscosity). This allows the lens cytosol to move forward to the central visual axis within confines of limited zonular force to increase optical power. [0005] Loss of this water layer means that a greater force is required to move the fluid from the equatorial to optical path (for increased geometric curvature-optical power). Similarly, when aquaporin-0 structure-function is compromised by disulfide bond formation to the core protein as a result of oxidative stress with age, this function layer is compromised and rendered inoperative. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The inventors have found that lipoic acid choline ester ("LACE") (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 8,410,462) can restore this critical fluid layer responsible for fluid movement, restore near vision, and reduce the core lens cytosol modulus that is affected by disulfide cross-linking. Thus, LACE formulations are in need for treating ocular diseases or disorders (e.g., presbyopia) where the critical fluid layer is lost or where disulfide cross- linking is an issue. [0007] In various embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof and a non-aqueous excipient. In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of lipoic acid choline ester and the non-aqueous excipient are mixed in an aqueous solution having a pH of 4 to 8 (e.g., 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.0, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, 5.8, 6.0, 6.2, 6.4, 6.6, 6.8, 7.0, 7.2, 7.4, 7.6, 7.8, 8.0, or any ranges based on these specified numeric values). In some embodiments, the aqueous solution comprises a buffer agent. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is free of a buffer agent. [0008] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of lipoic acid choline ester and a non-aqueous excipient, mixed in an aqueous solution having a pH of 4 to 6, wherein at least 95% of the lipoic acid choline ester is present in the pharmaceutical composition, as measured by HPLC, following storage at 25 °C under 40% relative humidity for 3 months.

[0010] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is prepared by mixing the therapeutically effective amount of lipoic acid choline ester and the non-aqueous excipient sequentially or simultaneously with the aqueous solution. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is prepared by first mixing the therapeutically effective amount of lipoic acid choline ester and the non-aqueous excipient to form a non-aqueous composition, and then mixing the non-aqueous composition with the aqueous solution. In some embodiments, the non-aqueous composition can be a solution, an emulsion, or a suspension formed by mixing lipoic acid choline ester and the non-aqueous excipient.

Mixing LACE with a Non-aqueous Excipient [0061] As stated above, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be formed by premixing the therapeutically effective amount of lipoic acid choline ester with a nonaqueous excipient to form a non-aqueous composition. The non-aqueous composition can then be further mixed with an aqueous solution, e.g., to form an ophthalmic formulation. In some aspects, the invention also provides a system or method of long- term storage of the pharmaceutical composition by storing the non-aqueous composition separately from the aqueous solution, for example, in a two-part device (e.g., as described herein) or in a kit. The separately stored non-aqueous composition can then be mixed with the aqueous solution to form an "activated" formulation prior to use. [0062] The non-aqueous composition can be a solution, an emulsion, or a suspension formed by mixing lipoic acid choline ester and the non-aqueous excipient. The mixing can be conducted under heat for a sustained period of time.

Storage of LACE Formulation [0072] As lipoic acid choline ester can be susceptible to hydrolysis and light induced oxidation, in some embodiments, the invention provides a method for storing lipoic acid choline ester in a non-aqueous environment, an oxygen free environment, and/or with reduced light exposure. In some embodiments, the lipoic acid choline ester is stored in a non-aqueous environment. In some embodiments, the lipoic acid choline ester is stored in the non-aqueous environment as a lyophilized powder. In some embodiments, the lipoic acid choline ester is stored in the non-aqueous environment as a non-aqueous composition (e.g., as described herein). In some embodiments, the lipoic acid choline ester is stored in a non-aqueous environment in an opaque container. In some embodiments, the non-aqueous environment is substantially oxygen free. [0073] In some embodiments, the lipoic acid choline ester is stored in an aqueous environment (e.g., after mixing a non-aqueous composition with an aqueous solution), wherein the aqueous environment is free of oxygen. In some embodiments, the lipoic acid choline ester is stored in the aqueous environment with reduced light exposure (e.g., in an opaque container). [0074] In some embodiments, the invention also provides a system for storing a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active ingredient in an aqueous solution, wherein the active ingredient (e.g., lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof) is susceptible to hydrolysis in the aqueous solution. [0075] In some embodiments, the system comprises a first compartment, a second compartment, and a seal separating the first and second compartments, wherein the first compartment comprises a non-aqueous composition comprising the active ingredient (e.g., lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof), the second compartment comprises an aqueous solution. In some embodiments, the active ingredient in the first compartment is in a solid form (e,g., a powder, e.g., a lyophilized powder). In some embodiments, the active ingredient in the first compartment is mixed with a non-aqueous excipient (e.g., as described herein). In some embodiments, the system is activated upon breaking the seal and mixing the non-aqueous solution with the aqueous solution. [0076] An example of the system is a modified eye drop bottle shown in Fig. 4. The eye drop bottle contains two parts, part 1 (includes the first compartment and the seal, shown as an insert in Fig. 4) and part 2 (includes the second compartment) (see Fig. 4), with the compartments separated from each other prior to formation of final formulation for patient activation and use. In some embodiments, part 1 of the eye drop bottle contains any of the non-aqueous compositions described herein (e.g., lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof mixed with glycerol). In some embodiments, part 1 of the eye drop bottle contains a non-aqueous composition comprising an active ingredient (e.g., a peptide) that is susceptible to hydrolysis in an aqueous solution. [0077] In some embodiments, part 1 of the eye drop bottle contains lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof in glycerol (e.g., 150 mg LACE/1.03 uL glycerol). In some embodiments, part 2 of the eye drop bottle contains an aqueous solution (4.8 mL) having the following excipients: 0.01 % by weight of Benzalkonium Chloride; 2.6 % by weight of Glycerin, USP; and 0.5% by weight of Alanine, USP, wherein the pH of the solution is 4.5 ± 0.2. [0078] The insert separates the non-aqueous composition from part 2 until activation, which allows long-term storage until short-term ocular treatment is started. In some embodiments, the insert includes a main insert stationary holder; an inner tube; and a lower seal, wherein the inner tube is configured to contain the non-aqueous composition and the lower seal is configured to prevent contact of the non-aqueous composition with the aqueous solution. In some embodiments, the eye drop bottle includes a dropper tip, which seals the insert. In some embodiments, the eye drop bottle is configured such that compressing or squeezing the bottle is sufficient to move the lower seal upward, whereby exposing the inner tube perforations to release the non-aqueous composition into the aqueous solution. [0079] In any of the embodiments described above, the non-aqueous composition comprising the active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g., lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof), prior to releasing into the aqueous solution, is shelf-stable for at least 3 months (e.g., 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 2 years, or more than 2 years). In some embodiments, the non-aqueous composition is characterized by having 2% or less (e.g., 1.5%, 1%), 0.5%), or 0.2%o) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient degraded. In some embodiments, the non-aqueous composition is characterized by having 10%> or less (e.g., 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 35, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.2%) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient degraded. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition formed by releasing the non-aqueous composition into the aqueous solution is shelf-stable for at least 3 months (e.g., 6 months, 9 months, or 12 months). [0080] In some embodiments, the invention also provides a method of storing an active ingredient that is susceptible to hydrolysis in an aqueous solution, the method comprising (a) providing the active ingredient in a first compartment; (b) providing the aqueous solution in a second compartment; and (c) separating the first and second compartments, e.g., with a seal, wherein the active ingredient in the first compartment is not in contact with the aqueous solution until just prior to usage, e.g., by breaking the seal. In some embodiments, the active ingredient in the first compartment is mixed with a non-aqueous excipient (e.g., as described herein). In some embodiments, the active ingredient is lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof, or a peptide. Suitable methods for configuring the first compartment and the second compartment include those described herein. Methods of Treatment [0081] The pharmaceutical compositions comprising lipoic acid choline ester or derivatives thereof (e.g., as described herein) can be employed in a method for treating or preventing a disease or disorder associated with oxidative damage. Diseases or disorders associated with oxidative damage are known. [0082] In some embodiments, the invention provides a method of treating an ocular disease in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to a lens or an eye of the subject a therapeutically effective amount of any of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein. In some embodiments, the ocular diseases are presbyopia, cataract, macular degeneration (including age-related macular degeneration), retinopathies (including diabetic retinopathy), glaucoma, or ocular inflammations. In some embodiments, the ocular disease is presbyopia.

In some embodiments, the method comprises administering to the lens or eye of the subject 1-5 drops (about 40 uL per drop) of the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments, the lens or eye of the subject is treated with the pharmaceutical composition 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more than 5 times a day, each time with 1-5 drops (about 40 uL per drop). In some embodiments, the lens or eye of the subject is treated with the pharmaceutical composition 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more than 5 drops each time. In some embodiments, the lens or eye of the subject is treated with the pharmaceutical composition herein twice or three times per day, each time with 1 or 2 drops (about 40 uL per drop). [0084] The methods include preventative methods that can be performed on patients of any age. The methods also include therapeutic methods that can be performed on patients of any age, particularly patients that are 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 52, 55, 57, 60, 70, 75, or 80 years of age or older. [0085] The following examples are illustrative and do not limit the scope of the claimed embodiments. EXAMPLES Example 1 Synthesis of LACE Chloride A two-step synthesis of lipoic acid choline ester chloride is described below. r SS--qs [0087] R-lipoic acid (5 g, 24.3 mmol), dimethylaminoethanol, (2.37 g, 26.7 mmol) and DMAP (0.9 g, 7.3 mmol) were suspended in MTBE (40 mL) at room temperature under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C and DIC (3.36 g, 26.7 mmol) in MTBE (20 mL) was added. After addition, the mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred for minimum 12 hours. The reaction was monitored by TLC (5% MeOH/CtLCb). Reaction mixture was filtered, washed with MTBE, and purified via flash chromatography to give yellow oil (3.3 g, 10.1 mmol). [0088] Lipoate obtained above (0.5 g, 1.8 mmol) was suspended in acetone (1.8 mL) and CH3CI (1.8 mL, 1.0 in MTBE ) was added. The reaction was heated under nitrogen at 50 °C in a sealed tube overnight. HPLC showed 95% conversion. Example 2 Studies on Stability of LACE Formulations [0089] Various lipoic acid choline ester formulations were tested for stabilities. Equipment [0090] The HPLC systems that were used in the performance of the HPLC assays were qualified by CGMP with IQ, OQ and PQ. Each system that was used consisted of a Waters 2695 Separations Module and Waters 2487 Dual λ Absorbance Detector.

The osmolality was measured following USP/NF <785> and SOP-00084. [0097] The HPLC method to analyze LACE Chloride used a Phenomenex Luna CN column with a 5 um particle size, 100 A pore size, 2.0 mm inner diameter, and 50 mm length (PN: 00B-4255-B0). The mobile phase consisted of 50% of 0.1 M Sodium Acetate and 50 % Acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, the detection wavelength was 225 nm, the column temperature was 40 °C, the injection volume was 20 uL, and the run time was 50 minutes. The working LACE chloride concentration was 0.1 mg/mL and plastic HPLC vials were used for the analysis. [0098] For the final stability screen on LACE chloride formulations (BCL457-180, BCL471-189, BCL483-079, BCL483-165, BCL489-027) the mobile phase concentration was errantly prepared to 0.01 M Sodium Acetate. This resulted in wide LACE peaks with a longer retention time, but did not seem to affect the results. The LACE standard was consistent with the LACE in the samples. Formulations BCL442-110 B-H [0099] Table 1 shows the detailed formulations of LACE chloride ophthalmic formulations at pH 5.5 and 7.0 (BCL442-110).

The LACE chloride assay was performed four days after preparation. The solutions showed that the LACE chloride is not very stable at pH 7 over four days from the time of preparation until the assay was performed. But the solutions at pH 5.5 resulted in a percent recovery from 86% to 109%, which showed that low pH is more stable for LACE chloride formulations. Formulations BCL448-053 C and D [0101] The detailed LACE chloride ophthalmic formulations in citrate buffer (BCL448- 053) are described in Table 2: Table 2: LACE Chloride Ophthalmic Formulations in Citrate Buffer [0102] The solutions were tested at the time of preparations and after storage at 5 °C (ambient RH), 25 °C (40% RH), 40 °C (not more than (NMT) 25% RH) and 57 °C (ambient RH) for three months. The solutions were evaluated for LACE chloride concentration to determine stability of LACE over time. The 1.5 % LACE chloride solution stored at 5 °C was the only solution that showed no significant change with recovery of 97.0% of LACE after 3 months. Formulation BCL457-180 D and E [0103] The details of LACE chloride ophthalmic formulations with no buffer, with or without polysorbate 80 (BCL457-180) are shown in Table 3. Table 3 : LACE Chloride Ophthalmic Formulations with No Buffer [0104] The solutions were tested at the time of preparations and after storage at 5 °C (ambient RH), 25 °C (40% RH), 40 °C (NMT 25% RH) and 57 °C (ambient RH) for three months. [0105] The results show that the formulations are stable for LACE Chloride potency for 3 months at 5 °C and 25 °C/40 % RH. The solutions at 40 °C/NMT 25% RH show potency less than 90 % of initial after two months. There is no significant stability difference observed between formulations with and without polysorbate 80. Example 3 LACE formulation with Propylene Glycol [0106] A solution of LACE chloride in propylene glycol was prepared to determine its stability. A solution of 1.0%> LACE chloride in propylene glycol was prepared and stored at -20 °C(ambient RH), 5 °C(ambient RH), and 25 °C (40% RH). The solutions were tested for LACE chloride potency after storage for 3 months. [0107] The results show that LACE chloride is not stable in propylene glycol after 3 months storage at 5 °C and 25 °C. In these samples, HPLC analysis (using the method described in Example 2) a peak with relative retention time (RRT) of approximately 0.73. For the solution stored at room temperature, the LACE chloride is completely converted to this peak. No additional peaks are detected. The peak at 0.73 RRT is not detected in the LACE chloride solutions in citrate buffer. Example 4 Three Month Stability Results Formulations [0108] Three formulations LACE Ophthalmic Solution, 10 mg/mL (1%); 30 mg/mL (3%); and 40 mg/mL (4%) were prepared and tested for stability.

Drug Related Impurities in 3% LACE Solution Example 5 Dioptin™ Eye Drop Reduces Mouse Lens Elasticity Methods [0116] In vitro test: Eight month old mouse lenses (C57BL/6J) were incubated for 12 hours in medium supplemented with selected levels (0 - 500μΜ) of lipoic acid (LA). Lens elasticity was measured using the coverslip method known. After elasticity measurements, lenses were homogenized in a dissociation medium containing alkylating agent 1 (free SH modification). The homogenate was filtered and the rinsed, resuspended, retentate was treated with reducing agent (TCEP) and alkylating agent 2 (S- S SHs modified). After filtration and rinses, the levels of alkylated SH groups in retentate 2 was determined. Bovine serum albumin was the positive control for the sulfhydryl analysis. [0117] In vivo test: Eight month old C57BL/6J mice were treated with 2.5 uL of a formulation of 5% LACE (Dioptin™) three times per day at eight hour intervals in the right eye (OD) for 5 weeks. After the final treatment, lenses were removed and placed in a cuvette containing HBSS. Elasticity was determined with a computer controlled instrument that provided Z stage upward movements in lum increments with concomitant force measurements with a Harvard Apparatus F10 isometric force transducer. The elasticity of lenses from 8 week old C57BL/6J mice was determined for comparison. Results [0118] LA treatment led to a concentration-dependent decrease in lens protein disulfides concurrent with an increase in lens elasticity. Changes in disulfides and elasticity were negatively correlated (R=0.87, p=0.006). The [LA]50 for both effects was 50±10 uM with maximal effect at 100 uM LA. After topical ocular treatment with Dioptin™ the lenses of the treated eyes of the old mice were more elastic than the lenses of untreated eyes, i.e. the relative force required for similar Z displacements was higher in the untreated eyes' lenses. In most instances the lenses of the treated eyes were even more elastic than the lenses of the 8 week old mice. [0119] As the peri-central elasticity of the human lens decreases with age, humans lose the ability to accommodate. The results here suggest a topical ocular treatment that increases lens elasticity through reduction of disulfides will, concomitantly, restore accommodative amplitude. Example 6 EV06 Draize Test for Eye Drop Ocular Safety [0120] Safety of the EV06 was evaluated by the Draize test to evaluate its use at concentrations as high as 5%. The Draize Test is an acute toxicity test devised in 1944 by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toxicologists John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines. Initially used for testing cosmetics, the procedure involves applying 0.5 mL or 0.5g of a test substance to the eye or skin of a restrained, conscious animal, and then leaving it for set amount of time before rinsing it out and recording its effects. Corneal, iris, and conjunctival responses were evaluated using the scale described by Draize et al, J. Pharmacol. & Exp. Therapeutics, 52:377-390 (1944)]. Because of the importance of the cornea to vision, 73% of the Draize score is based on corneal damage. A normal score was 0, increasing amounts of damage result in a higher score, with the maximum score possible being 110. A Draize score was computed at each observation time by averaging the total scores of all rabbits tested. Observations were made and recorded 24, 48, and 72 hours after treatment. [0121] This test consists of instilling 30 to 50μί of the product into one eye of 6 New Zealand white rabbits and monitoring to observe any abnormal clinical signs such as redness of conjunctiva, swelling, or increased blinking which may indicate irritation. The EV06 test concentrations (3%-5%) demonstrated no adverse effects (Draize Rabbit Eye test score of 2.0 +/- 0.6) and thus considered "not corrosive or irritating." Example 7 Dioptin™ for restoration of accommodation in presbyopes Methods [0122] Screening studies were conducted to determine the highest tolerated concentration when applied topically to rabbit eyes, in conjunction with bioanalysis of corneal, aqueous humor, and lens concentrations of EV06 and its metabolites. In a GLP rabbit study, animals were treated with topical 0, 1, 3 or 4% Dioptin solution three times daily for 90 consecutive days. Slit-lamp exams and fundoscopy were performed at pre-dose baseline and after 1, 30, and 90 days of dosing. Daily clinical observations, food consumption, body weights, clinical pathology, and toxicokinetics were performed. Full necropsy and ocular histopathology were also conducted. Results [0123] Dioptin™ ophthalmic formulations were well tolerated in rabbit eyes. No dose- related ocular signs of toxicity were observed at any timepoint in the GLP study. Ophthalmic exams were normal, with the exception of mild (1+) conjunctival congestion and (1+) discharge observed in some of animals dosed with 3% or 4% Dioptin™ on the first day of dosing, which persisted throughout the dosing period, but did not worsen. No systemic effects or adverse events were reported. Plasma levels of EV06 were at or below the limits of detection, indicating rapid metabolism. [0124] Dioptin™ is a promising new treatment for presbyopia, with the potential to restore several diopters of accommodation. In preclinical studies, EV06 has been shown to be effective at increasing lens elasticity through reduction of lens protein disulfides. The ophthalmic formulation is non-irritating, and systemic and ocular safety have been demonstrated in a 90 day GLP ocular toxicology study at topical doses up to 4% three times daily. Example 8 Dioptin™ Eye Drop to Treat Presbyopia: corneal penetration and ocular pharmacokinetics Methods [0125] Esters of lipoic acid were evaluated in rabbits for corneal penetration. Rabbits were also used to examine the metabolism, absorption, and distribution of LACE (LA prodrug) using HPLC-ESI/MS/MS (LOD > 2 ng/ml). Results [0126] LACE was found to improve penetration over lipoic acid. A prototypic ocular eye drop formulation of LACE was tested as Dioptin™. It is rapidly degraded by endogenous butycholinesterases and provides elevated ocular tissue levels of LA. Lens DHLA (measured as LA) and LACE are both significantly elevated [P< 0.05] using 3% Dioptin™ treated compared to untreated contralateral eye; 22.6 +/- 9.1(5) and 142.3 +/- 31.9 (5) nM/L, respectively. [0127] As shown in Fig. 2A, Dioptin™ elevates LACE (prodrug) and LA (active) in ocular tissue samples (ESI/LC/MS/MS); importantly in the lens. LA can be cleared away in the form of 6,8-bismethylthio-octanoic acid (BMOA). [0128] A schematic showing of LACE metabolism is shown in Fig. 2B. The absorbed LACE molecule into the cornea is converted into non-surfactant natural products (lipoic acid and choline) in the cornea by pseudochlolinesterases (PCHE), which minimizes corneal damage during transit into the aqueous. Importantly, this corneal cleavage process then allows for transfer of these intermediates into the aqueous. This rapid degradation into lipoic acid allows applying a higher concentration of LACE to an eye compared to that of a non-degradable cationic surfactants, for example, the safety limit for ocular use of BAK is < 0.01%. [0129] For comparison, in humans, the percent uptake (area under the curve or total over 4 hour period) is only 0.37% (Cagini) following application of lipoic acid formulation to the eyes; while separate animals studies (rabbits and mice) with EV06 formulation, 2.2% of the applied drop penetrates into the aqueous measured as LA. See Fig. 3. [0130] In conclusion, Dioptin™ provides a convenient ocular delivery platform for improved aqueous delivery of a dithiol compound to reduce protein disulfides in order to soften the lens and restore accommodative amplitude, which is useful for treatment of Presbyopia. Example 9 LACE formulation with Glycerol [0131] Lipoic acid choline ester was mixed in neat glycerol (no water) with brief heating to 80 °C for 8 hours. High concentrations of lipoic acid choline ester in a final clear solution were found. The final clear solution is stable. Example 10 Single bottle 2-part delivery system [0132] A single bottle 2-part delivery system is described for the 2-part stable long-term manufactured formulation. This delivery bottle uses commercially available bottle, dropper tip, and cap. An insert is placed into the commercially available standard bottle (Fig. 4, left top), which separates the 2-parts until activation. [0133] Capacity: 4mL; neck finish: 15-415 • Material: natural clear LDPE bottle with white cap • Provides reliable repeatable dispensing of reagents; flexible contact-clear bottle permits easy content identification • Excellent chemical resistance; material is suitable for most biotech diagnostic and pharmaceutical applications • Delivers 40μ1 drops (based on water; viscosity affects drop size) one at a time • Manufacturer: Thermo Fisher Nalgene® • Manufacturer Part No: 2750-9125 [0134] Composition of Part 1 and Part 2 are shown in Table 10 below: TABLE 10: Composition of Parts 1 and 2 PARTS 1+2 "ACTIVATED" Preparation of Part 1 [0135] 150 mg of solid lipoic acid choline ester chloride is placed into 103 uL of medical grade glycerol and heated at 80 °C for 6 hours. An amorphous micelle is formed. [0136] The insert shown in Fig. 4 (left drawing) has the following assembly components: the main insert stationary holder 1; the inner tube 2 that contains the non-hydro lytic solvent and also contains a filter to remove particulates; the lower seal 3 that contains the liquid within the inner tube; and the dropper tip 5 for sealing the insert prior to sterilization. The active agent in part-1 composition is added to the inner tube 2, as shown in 4. The dropper tip is then placed. Part 1 is sterilized using gamma-irradiation. Assembling Parts 1 and 2 [0137] Part-2 contains the aqueous solution that is separately sterilized. Once the insert and aqueous solution are properly sterilized, they are combined (cap removed) under a sterile controlled manufacturing environment (Fig. 4, middle drawing). Part-1 insert is placed into the Part-2 container. Once assembled, long-term storage is possible without need for carefully controlled temperature conditions (< 45 °C). Activation [0138] As shown in Fig. 4 (right drawing), to activate, the patient only needs to compress or "squeeze" the bottle to release part-1 into part-2 aqueous solution. This step moves the lower seal 3 (Fig. 4) upward to expose the inner tube 2 (Fig. 4) perforations. Part-1 composition then flows into part-2 aqueous solution. The solution is readily dissolved with brief shaking. The lid is still in place during activation. The final formulation (about 5 mL) contains: 3% Lipoic Acid Choline Ester; 0.01 % Benzalkonium Chloride; 2.7 % Glycerin, USP; and 0.5% Alanine, USP; with a pH of 4.5 ± 0.2. [0139] This provides sufficient formulation for a BID 60-day treatment (40 uL/drop). [0140] The final formulation is sufficiently stable to maintain predicted outcome. The final formulation is stable when refrigerated (5 °C) for 30 days without degradation > 0.5% of the active compound. [0141] Parts 1 and 2 maintained in the 2-part bottle provides a long-term shelf life resistant to thermal degradation < 45 °C for 2 years.
