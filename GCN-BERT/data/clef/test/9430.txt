The viscosity values are read after 60 seconds from the start of the measurement. In the selection of the viscosity, special attention must be paid to the way of application and packaging to be used. It should be noted that the viscosity of the conditioners is less sensitive to temperature fluctuations. In other words, the viscosity changes observed with either decreasing or increasing temperatures is relatively small when compared to well known gel type of preparations thickened such as with hydroxyethylcellulose. Compositions of the present invention may further comprise additional ingredients used in hair conditioning compositions as long as do not negatively influence the stability and the effect of the compositions. Compositions of the present invention used directly on hair either after shampooing or wetting hair (without applying cleansing preparations) and rinsed off from hair with water after a processing time of maximum 30 min, preferably in the range of 1 to 20 min and more preferably in the range of 1 to 15 and most preferably 1 to 10 min. The preferred form of application is on shampooed and optionally towel dried hair. Compositions of the present invention may also be used after mixing with a conventional conditioner at a conditioner of present invention to conventional conditioner ratio of 1:1 to 1:10, preferably 1:1 to 1:5. In such a case the compositions of the present invention boost the effect of conventional conditioners and long lasting conditioning can as well be achieved which certainly may last shorter than the same effect achived when composition is applied without prior mixing. The following examples should illustrate the invention but not limit it.

The above composition was tested in a half side test with 10 female volunteers having approximately shoulder length hair Hairdresser carried the first application and also evaluated hair status in wet and dry stages. To this end, the volunteer's hair was washed with a conventional shampoo and the composition of example 1 above is applied to one half and the other half was applied a composition as given below as "comparative example 1 ". The amount of product was approximately the same, 5 g each side. After application compositions were homogenously distributed on hair and processed for 5 min and rinsed off from the hair. Hair was towel dried and evaluated by hairdresser in wet and dry stage. The results are presented in Table I. Afterwards the volunteers were asked to wash their hair at home on the next or the day after next day (depending on volunteers washing frequency) and asked to evaluate their hair themselves. The results of the evaluation are presented in Table II. Furthermore, the same evaluation after the first hair wash was repeated again after the second hair wash. Results are presented in Table II.

From third wash on the volunteers were allowed to use their conventional conditioner only on the side they feel it needed. Number of hair washes where no additional conditioner used was asked to the volunteers. The results are in Table III. Table III: Additional conditioner was used after (Xth) washExample 1Example 1-A3rd wash1104th wash3-5th wash4-6th wash2- From the above results, it is clear that Example 1 gives hair long lasting conditioning effect. The effect lasts on average 4.7 hair washes. Similar results were obtained with the following examples.
