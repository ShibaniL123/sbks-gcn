FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to hair colour and hair bleaching compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The permanent alteration of the colour of keratinous fibres, in particular human hair, by the application of hair dyes is well known. In order to provide the consumer with the hair colour and the intensity of colour desired, a very complex chemical process is utilized. Permanent hair dyeing formulations typically comprise oxidative hair dye precursors, which can diffuse into the hair through the cuticle and into the cortex where they can then react with each other and suitable oxidising agents to form the end dye molecules. Due to the larger size of these resultant molecules they are unable to readily diffuse out of the hair during subsequent washing with water and/or detergents; hence delivering a consumer-desired permanency of colour. This reaction typically takes place in an aggressive environment at approximately pH 10 in the presence of an alkalizing agent and in the presence of an oxidizing agent. Moreover, the consumer repeats this process regularly in order to maintain the desired hair colour and shade and the intensity of colour and to ensure continual, even coverage of the hair including coverage of new hair growth. The manufacturer of such products is also required to work within a large number of constraints. Since these products are being placed in direct contact with the consumers' skin, the potential exists for accidental contact with the eye or for ingestion (for example), which can occur during the dyeing process. Therefore, the formulation must meet rigorous safety requirements and not induce any allergic reactions. In addition to meeting these requirements, the products must also be optically and olfactory pleasing to the consumer. In particular, the products also need to meet certain physical parameters in order to ensure that the product can be easily applied to the hair by the consumer to provide the desired effect, without unintentional staining of the consumers' clothes, skin particularly along the hair line or other objects. The manufacturer is also required to provide the hair colouring consumer a large range of different resulting colours. Some consumers may just wish to enhance the natural colour of the hair, whilst others may wish to cover grey or completely alter the hair colour to a different natural appearing hair colour or a 'synthetic' appearing hair colour. Consequently, the manufacturer may provide over twenty different formulations, of varying colours and shades, to address the range of consumer specific needs. These formulations have to be individually formulated and are typically complex formulae containing a mixture of different dye compounds. As a result the manufacture of such product ranges can be costly and complex. However, despite the fact that commercial hair dyeing products have been available for many years, the products still exhibit a number of consumer-related deficiencies. Typically permanent hair dye products will contain an alkali, typically a source of ammonia. This serves the purpose of swelling the hair allowing the entry of the dye precursor molecules into the hair and also improves the lightening effect of the oxidising agent, which is typically hydrogen peroxide. However, ammonia is also volatile and its associated odour is extremely unpleasant to the consumers' of such products, particularly as these hair dye products are used in close proximity to the nasal region. Hence, it would be highly desirable to provide an oxidative hair colouring and/or bleaching composition, which delivers the consumer required lightening level and colour, but which has reduced or eliminated the detectable ammonia odour. In fact another deficiency area in current hair colouring products is the provision of hair colouring products which deliver the required hair lightening effect. Delivering the required level of lightening is particularly important in order to provide the full range of colour shades demanded by the consumer, especially for blonde shades and grey coverage. Such products pose particular difficulties to the manufacturer, as they usually require the use of high levels of oxidising agent and ammonia in order to deliver the required lightening effect. However, in additional to the problems associated with the presence of high levels of ammonia in these products, as discussed herein above, the presence of these high levels of ammonia and/or oxidizing agent also affect the condition of the hair and may in some cases induce mild skin irritation on the scalp. In particular, the hydrophilicity of the hair surface is increased during the colouring process, which alters the sensory perception of the hair and its overall manageability during, immediately after colouring and during the subsequent wash and styling cycles until the next colourant application. Hence, it would also be highly desirable to provide an oxidative hair colouring and/or bleaching composition which delivers the required lightening and/or colour without unnecessary hair damage. Moreover, in order to provide a product which the consumer can easily apply to the hair without dripping onto the skin, clothes or bathroom or salon surfaces, hair colourant products must be designed such that the applied composition has a certain required viscosity. This is either achieved by providing the dye composition and the oxidizing composition as so called thin-thin type liquid formulations which are thickened upon mixing, or, where at least one of the components, either the dye composition or the oxidizing composition, preferably the dye composition, is provided as a thickened formulation which thickens the total composition upon mixing. These thickened compositions can be achieved by the use of a gel network system which provide the desired thickness to either the dye composition or the oxidizing composition or, preferably both compositions. Furthermore, such gel networks are highly desirable as they also provide additional benefits of a cream like texture, conditioner like feel and appearance, smooth rinse and improved hair feel. Such thickened gel network systems are described in WO2007/102119, EP1878469 and EP1832273. These compositions have a viscosity range typical for retail applications which is in the region of 1Pas to 8Pas. In the professional hair salon market, the hair colour professionals typically do not use predetermined combinations of dye and oxidizing compositions or kits as in the retail market. Instead, the hair salon professionals are able to use any combination of commercially available dye and oxidizing compositions. For the professional market, the available oxidizing compositions are typically provided with a variety of viscosities. Consequently, the dye compositions that are combined with the oxidizing compositions need to be formulated to ensure that they are able to thicken the oxidizing compositions to the required viscosity independent of the viscosity of the starting composition of the oxidizing agent. In addition, in the professional salon the mixed dye and oxidative compositions are typically much thicker than the mixed compositions provided for the retail market and are typically in the range of 9 to 16Pas. This is to enable the hair salon professionals to use a variety of techniques to apply the composition in order to provide their clients with the desired results. Typically this is delivered using the brush and bowl technique. Compositions have a viscosity typical to retail applications are considered not acceptable by hair colour professionals. However, certain professional thickened compositions comprising such gel network systems have been found to exhibit a phenomenon whereby after application to the hair, the composition tends to crack away from the root along the length of the hair strand away from the root. As a result the roots do not necessarily receive the required amount of composition in order to deliver the desired result. Particularly for regular hair colourant users, virgin hair growth coverage at the roots is essential for a satisfactory outcome and this problem needs to be addressed, without the necessity for the hair salon professional to continuously check and reapply the composition to the roots to ensure complete coverage. This problem of lack of effective root adhesion is further exacerbated with compositions comprising hydrogen peroxide and carbonate oxidizing systems. Hence it would be desirable to provide the consumer, particularly the hair salon professional with a hair colorant product, which in addition to delivering the required lightening, colour deposition, has the required rheology and viscosity such that it can be utilised by hair salon professionals and which does not exhibit any cracking away from the roots during or after application of the composition on the hair. It has now been surprisingly found that oxidative hair colouring compositions comprising at least one oxidizing agent, a specified gel network thickener system comprising a specified tertiary system, and a polysaccharide and polyol as defined herein having the required viscosity and ionic strength can be used for professional hair colour applications while exhibiting excellent hair root adhesion. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a hair colouring and hair bleaching composition comprising an oxidizing agent, a gel network thickening system comprising i) a first anionic surfactant component selected from C14 to 30 alkyl phosphate, C14 to C30 alkyl ether phosphate or mixtures thereof,ii) a second component selected from C14 to C30 fatty alcohols andiii) a third non-ionic surfactant component selected from polyoxyethylene C14 to C30 alkyl ethers, wherein said composition comprises at least 1% of said first surfactant and at least 3% of the sum of said first surfactant component, second component and third surfactant component, and wherein said composition further comprises at least 0.05% of a polysaccharide, at least 3% of a polyol selected from propyleneglycol, butoxydiglycol, ethoxydiglycol, hexylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, glycerol, polyglycerol, and mixtures thereof, and wherein said composition has an ionic strength of less than 0.75 mole/kg and a viscosity of from 9 Pas to 16 Pas. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of treating hair comprising the steps of applying the composition of the present invention to the hair for from about 2 to 60 minutes and subsequently rinsing said composition from the hair. In another embodiment the present invention relates to the use of the composition of the present invention to improve the adhesion of the composition to the hair preferably the hair roots. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION While the specification concludes with claims, which particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description. As used herein the term "hair" to be treated may be "living" i.e. on a living body or may be "non-living" i.e. in a wig, hairpiece or other aggregation of non-living keratinous fibers. Mammalian, preferably human hair is preferred. However wool, fur and other keratin containing fibers are suitable substrates for the compositions according to the present invention. All percentages are by weight of the total composition unless specifically stated otherwise. When more than one composition are used during a treatment, the total weight to be considered is the total weight of all the compositions applied on the hair simultaneously (i.e. the weight found "on head") unless otherwise specified. All ratios are weight ratios unless specifically stated otherwise. All molar concentrations are by weight of the total composition and presented as number of moles of component(s) in one kilogram of the composition, or "mole/kg". When more than one composition are used during a treatment, the total weight to be considered is the total weight of all the compositions applied on the hair simultaneously (i.e. the weight found "on head") unless otherwise specified. Oxidizing agent The compositions according to the present invention comprise or are used in combination with a composition that comprises at least one source of an oxidizing agent. Preferred oxidizing agents for use herein are water-soluble peroxygen oxidizing agents. "Water-soluble" as defined herein means that in standard condition at least 0.1g, preferably 1g, more preferably 10g of said oxidizing agent can be dissolved in 1 liter of deionized water. The oxidizing agents are valuable for the initial solubilisation and decolorisation of the melanin (bleaching) and accelerate the oxidation of the oxidative dye precursors (oxidative dyeing) in the hair shaft. Any oxidizing agent known in the art may be utilized in the present invention. Preferred water-soluble oxidizing agents are inorganic peroxygen materials capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution. Water-soluble peroxygen oxidizing agents are well known in the art and include hydrogen peroxide, inorganic alkali metal peroxides such as sodium periodate and sodium peroxide and organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, melamine peroxide, and inorganic perhydrate salt bleaching compounds, such as the alkali metal salts of perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, persilicates, persulphates and the like. These inorganic perhydrate salts may be incorporated as monohydrates, tetrahydrates etc. Alkyl and aryl peroxides, and or peroxidases may also be used. Mixtures of two or more such oxidizing agents can be used if desired. The oxidizing agents may be provided in aqueous solution or as a powder which is dissolved prior to use. Preferred for use in the compositions according to the present invention are hydrogen peroxide, percarbonate (which may be used to provide a source of both oxidizing agent and carbonate ions and or ammonium ions), persulphates and combinations thereof. According to the present invention the compositions comprise from about 0.1 % to about 10% by weight, preferably from about 1% to about 7% by weight, and most preferably from about 2% to about 5% by weight of an oxidizing agent. Gel Network Thickener According to the present invention, the hair colouring and bleaching compositions comprise a gel network thickener system. The gel network thickener system of this invention is typically provided in the dye composition and subsequently mixed with the oxidizing composition. The gel network thickener system of this invention is defined as a thickening system comprising a tertiary system. This system comprises a first anionic surfactant component selected from C14 to C30 alkyl phosphates, C14 to C30 alkyl ether phosphates and or mixtures thereof, a second component selected from C14 to C30 fatty alcohols and a third non-ionic surfactant component selected from polyoxyethylene C14 to C30 alkyl ethers. Those skilled in the art will recognize that gel network thickener systems usually have a complex structure of networked lamellar bi-layers and / or vesicles and sometimes crystals. These systems usually have creamy appearance and feel and are thus particularly desirable. In particular the gel network system of the present invention allows for easy and efficient mixing of the dye composition with the oxidizing composition containing a source of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the gel network system delivers the desired mixed viscosity level, independent of the developer composition per se and its viscosity prior to mixing. The latter property is of particular benefit for example in professional hair colour applications in hair salons, where enabling the flexibility to utilize a range of different developer compositions and or viscosity is often particularly desirable. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that gel network thickener system components described in this invention have appropriate geometrical arrangement in the gel network lamellar bi-layers, preventing bi-layers from de-swelling and thus resisting viscosity loss. It is further believed that non-ionic surfactant of this invention has more suppressed swelling due to the higher ionic strength in the dye composition, and thus stability is provided by the ionic surfactant, whereas after dilution with the oxidizing composition, the concentration of ions is reduced leading to non-ionic surfactant re-swelling to provide the required additional thickening. The first surfactant component of the gel network thickener system is selected from C14 to C30, preferably C14 to C18 alkyl phosphate, C14 to C30, preferably C14-C18 alkyl ether phosphate and or mixtures thereof. Preferably the alkyl ether phosphates have an average of from 1 to 20, preferably from 1 to 10 and most preferably from 1 to3 ethylene oxide units. According to the present invention, the composition comprises at least about 1% by weight of said first surfactant component, preferably from about 1% to 3%, more preferably from about 1.2% to 2% by weight of the composition of said first surfactant component. The first surfactant component assists in the formation of the gel network and is preferably utilized at the above levels to assist the maintenance of the desired rheology range particularly at the upper value to prevent excessive stickiness. According to the present invention, the gel network system of the present invention comprises as a second component a linear or branched C14 to C30 fatty alcohol and or mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the second component is selected from cetyl, stearyl, cetostearyl or behenyl alcohols or mixtures thereof. According to the present invention, the composition may comprise from about 2% to 8%, preferably from about 4% to 6% of said fatty alcohol by weight of said composition. Typically, the second component may be comprised within the dye composition or the oxidizing composition or both, preferably the second component is comprised in both compositions. The second component assists in the stabilization of the gel network system and also assists in the maintenance of the desired rheology range particularly at the upper value to prevent excessive stickiness. The third surfactant component of the gel network thickener system is a non-ionic surfactant, selected from polyoxyethylene C14 to C30 alkyl ethers, comprising one or more polyethyleneoxide chains, preferably having at least about 25, preferably from about 50 to 200, most preferably from about 100 to 200 ethylene oxide units. Suitable surfactants include ceteareth-25, steareth-100, steareth-150, steareth-200 and mixtures thereof. The third surfactant component acts as a co emulsifier and stabilizer of the gel network system. Moreover, whilst not being bound by theory the third surfactant assists in the formation of a soft and smooth composition. According to the present invention the composition may comprise from about 0.1 % to 5%, preferably from about 0,5% to 1% by weight of said composition of said third surfactant component. More than one surfactant and or component of each of the above specified types of the surfactants and components may be used in the gel network of the present invention. The compositions of the present invention comprise a total amount of said first surfactant, second component and third surfactant of at least about 3%, preferably at least about 4%, more preferably at least about 5% by weight of the composition. Polysaccharide The present invention further comprises a polysaccharide. The polysaccharides for use herein are, for example, chosen from glucans, modified and unmodified starches (such as those derived, for example, from cereals, for instance wheat, corn or rice, from vegetables, for instance yellow pea, and tubers, for instance potato or cassaya), amylose, amylopectin, glycogen, dextrans, celluloses and derivatives thereof (methylcelluloses, hydroxyalkylcelluloses, ethyl hydroxyethylcelluloses, and carboxymethylcelluloses), mannans, xylans, lignins, arabans, galactans, galacturonans, chitin, chitosans, glucuronoxylans, arabinoxylans, xyloglucans, glucomannans, pectic acids and pectins, alginic acid and alginates, arabinogalactans, carrageenans, agars, glycosaminoglucans, gum arabics, gum tragacanths, ghatti gums, karaya gums, carob gums, galactomannans, such as guar gums, and nonionic derivatives thereof (hydroxypropyl guar) and bio-polysaccharides, such as xanthan gums, gellan gums, welan gums, scleroglucans, succinoglycans and mixtures thereof. For example, suitable polysaccharides are described in "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", Kirk-Othmer, Third Edition, 1982, volume 3, pp. 896-900, and volume 15, pp. 439-458, in "Polymers in Nature" by E. A. MacGregor and C. T. Greenwood, published by John Wiley & Sons, Chapter 6, pp. 240-328,1980, and in "Industrial Gums-Polysaccharides and their Derivatives", edited by Roy L. Whistler, Second Edition, published by Academic Press Inc. The polysaccharide is preferably a bio-polysaccharide, particularly preferable are bio-polysaccharides selected from xanthan gum, gellan gum, welan gum, scleroglucan or succinoglycan, for example the material sold under the name Keltrol® T by the company Kelco and the material sold by the name Rheozan® by the company Rhodia Chimie and mixtures thereof. Most preferred are xanthan gum and succinogylcan and mixtures thereof, most preferably xanthan gum. The composition according to the present invention comprises at least about 0.05% of said polysaccharide, preferably from about 0.05% to 0.125% of said polysaccharide by weight of the composition. Whilst not being bound by theory it is believed that the polysaccharide acts as a plastisicer and tackiness enhancer, and in particular at the above levels it assists in improving root adhesion. Polyol The composition of the present invention further comprises at least about 3%, preferably at least about 3.5%, most preferably at least about 4%, even more preferably at least about 4.5% by weight of a polyol. Suitable polyols are selected from propyleneglycol, butoxydiglycol, ethoxydiglycol, hexylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, glycerol, polyglicerol and mixtures thereof. Preferably said polyol is propylene glycol. Without being bound by theory it is believed that the selected polyol utilised within the given range enables the viscosity level to be adjusted as required, whilst also acting as a lubricant to ensure that the composition is smoother and softer thus improving the feel thereby supporting root adhesion. Ionic strength According to the present invention the compositions have an ionic strength as defined herein of less than 0.75mole/kg, preferably from 0.1 to less than 0.75 mole/kg, more preferably from 0.2 to 0.6 mole/kg. Whilst not being bound by theory, it is believed that the ionic strength value also affects the resultant viscosity and root adhesion properties of the composition. The ionic strength can be affected by salt resources such as the dyes, sodium sulphate, anti-oxidants, ammonium carbonate and chelants such as EDDS. The dye tends to have the greatest effect on the ionic strength and thus the amounts added in order to provide any particular shade need to be considered in terms of ionic strength as well as dye outcome in order to prevent viscosity and root adhesion problems. The ionic strength of the composition is a function of the concentration of all ions present in that solution and is determined according to the formula: I=12∑i=1nmi⁢zi2 where mi = molality of ion i (M = mol·/Kg H2O), zi = charge number of that ion, and the sum is taken over all ions in the solution. For example, for a 1:1 electrolyte such as sodium chloride, the ionic strength is equal to the concentration, but for MgSO4 the ionic strength is four times higher. Generally multivalent ions contribute strongly to the ionic strength. For example the ionic strength of a mixed 0.050 M Na2SO4 and 0.020 M NaCl solution is: I = 1/2((2 × (+1)2 × 0.050) + (+1)2 × 0.020 + (-2)2 × 0.050 + (-1)2 × 0.020) = 0.17 M. Viscosity According to the present invention the compositions have a viscosity of from 9 to 16 Pas, preferably from 9 to 15 Pas more preferably from 10 to 14 Pas and most preferably from 11 to 13Pas. Viscosity is determined according to the test method defined hereinafter. This viscosity range allows the hair salon professionals to have maximum flexibly to utilize one of numerous application techniques that may be required by any particular client providing a composition which has conditioner like properties and which is not too thick and sticky. Additional components The compositions of the present invention may further comprise additional ingredients which include, but are not limited to, hair dyeing agents such as oxidative dye precursors, non-oxidative pre-formed dyes, carbonate ion sources, additional thickeners and / or rheology modifiers, solvents, radical scavenger, enzymes, additional surfactants, conditioning agents, carriers, antioxidants, stabilizers, chelants, perming actives, perfume, reducing agents (thiolactic acid), hair swelling agents and/or polymers. Some of these additional components are detailed hereafter. Al kalizing agent According to the present invention the composition may optionally comprises an alkalizing agent, preferably ammonium ions and or ammonia. Particularly, preferred alkalizing agents are those which provide a source of ammonium ions. Any source of ammonium ions is suitable for use herein. Preferred sources include ammonium chloride, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium acetate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium hydrogen carbonate, ammonium carbamate, ammonium hydroxide, ammonium percarbonate, and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred are ammonium carbonate, ammonium carbamate, ammonium hydroxide and mixtures thereof. The compositions of the present invention may comprise from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight, preferably from about 0.5% to about 5%, most preferably from about 1% to about 3% of an alkalizing agent, preferably ammonium ions. Preferably, if present, the ammonium ions and carbonate ions are present in the composition at a weight ratio of from 3:1 to 1:10, preferably 2:1 to 1:5. Preferably, the compositions of the present invention have a pH of from about 12 to about 7.5, more preferably from about 11 to about 8.4 and most preferably from about 10 to about 8.5. The pH of the compositions can be determined by using either a Mettler Toledo MP220 or a MP225 pH equipment, fitted with a standard laboratory pH electrode. The equipment is calibrated before each use using standard calibration buffers and using standard calibration procedure. Hair dyes The hair compositions of the present invention are preferably hair colouring compositions which comprise oxidative dyeing compositions. Such compositions comprise oxidative hair dye precursors or developers (also known as primary intermediates) that will deliver a variety of hair colors to the hair. These small molecules are activated by the oxidizing agent and react with further molecules to form a larger coloured complex in the hair shaft. The precursors can be used alone or in combination with other precursors, and one or more can be used in combination with one or more couplers. Couplers (also known as color modifiers or secondary intermediates) are generally colorless molecules that can form colors in the presence of activated precursors, and are used with other precursors or couplers to generate specific color effects or to stabilize the color. The choice of precursors and couplers will be determined by the color, shade and intensity of coloration that is desired. The precursors and couplers can be used herein, singly or in combination, to provide dyes having a variety of shades ranging from ash blondee to black. These compounds are well known in the art, and include aromatic diamines, aminophenols, aromaticdiols and their derivatives (a representative but not exhaustive list of oxidation dye precursor can be found in Sagarin, "Cosmetic Science and Technology", "Interscience, Special Edn. Vol. 2 pages 308 to 310). It is to be understood that the precursors detailed below are only by way of example and are not intended to limit the compositions and processes herein..

Method of Use It is understood that the examples of methods of use and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention. Retail oxidative hair dye compositions are usually sold in kits comprising, in individually packaged components such as separate containers, a dye component (also called "dye cream" for emulsions or "dye liquid" for solutions) comprising the oxidative dye, precursors and alkalizing agent which is typically ammonia in a suitable carrier and; a hydrogen peroxide component (also called "hydrogen peroxide cream" for emulsions or "hydrogen peroxide liquid" for solutions) comprising the oxidizing agent (usually hydrogen peroxide). The consumer mixes the dye component and hydrogen peroxide component together immediately before use and applies it onto the hair. Similarly, retail bleaching compositions are also usually sold as a kit comprising two or three individually packaged components typically in two or three separate containers. The first component comprises the ammonium ion source (e.g. ammonia), the second component comprises the oxidizing agent and the third (optional) component comprises a second oxidizing agent. The bleaching compositions are obtained by mixing the above-mentioned compositions immediately before use. For the professional hair salon market, the hair dye composition and oxidising compositions and or bleaching compositions are typically supplied independently to allow the professional to select a preferred combination. After working the combined mixture for a few minutes (to insure uniform application to all of the hair), the oxidative dye composition is allowed to remain on the hair for an amount sufficient for the dyeing to take place (usually from about 2 to 60 minutes, typically about 30 to 45 minutes). The consumer or salon professional then rinses the hair thoroughly with water and or shampoo and allows it to dry. It will be observed that the hair has changed from its original colour to the desired colour. When present in the oxidative dye compositions and bleaching compositions, the optional conditioning agent can be provided in a third container. In the latter case, all three compositions can be mixed immediately before use and applied together, or the content of the third container can be applied (after an optional rinse step) as a post-treatment immediately after the oxidative dye composition or bleaching composition resulting from the mixture of the other containers. The present invention also includes embodiments wherein the method of colouring or bleaching the hair comprises applying a composition comprising at least one oxidising agent, and a gel network thickening system as defined hereinabove, a polysaccharide and a polyol as defined whereby the composition has a given viscosity and ionic strength. The kits described hereinabove are well known in the art and the composition in each container can be manufactured utilizing any one of the standard approaches, these include a) 'Oil in water' process, b) 'Phase Inversion' process and c) 'One-pot' process. For example, when using "oil in water" process, surfactants of the present invention are added to approximately 50% of total water amount of the composition at about 90°C, homogenized for 15 to 30 min, then cooled to room temperature thus forming gel network thickener premix; this premix is then mixed cold with remaining amounts of water, other optional components and / or oxidizing agent, thus forming the first and the second component parts of the above described bleaching or colouring kit. The present invention may be utilized in a variety of packaging and dispensing devices. These dispensing devices can come in the form of separate devices which may be used independently or in combination with one another. Typically, the hair colouring or bleaching compositions are contained within separate single or multi compartment containers so that the compositions can be stored separately from one another before use. The compositions are then mixed together by a mixing means and then applied to the consumer's hair by an application means. The most common packaging device which can be used for the present invention involves storing the developer in a container such as a bottle, tube, aerosol, or a sachet and separately storing the dye lotion in an additional compartment within the developer container or in a separate container which may be identical such as a dual sachet or aerosol systems for example or different such as a bottle and tube system. The consumer or hair salon professional may mix the oxidizing composition and the dye composition by any means. This may simply involve the use of a mixing bowl into which the lotions are dispensed and then mixed, preferably using a mixing means such as a tool. Alternatively it may involve the addition of one of the lotions into the container of the other lotion, (typically the dye lotion is added to the developer lotion), followed by manual shaking or mixing with a tool. Another system involves the perforation or displacement of a seal located between the separate compartments of the dye and developer lotion within a single container or sachet followed by manual mixing within the container or in a separate and or additional container. The devices described herein above can also be used in combination with a product delivery and or application tool to aid application of the product onto the hair. Again these devices may be of a very simple nature such as a nozzle attached to one of the containers or a separate applicator device such as a comb or brush. Such combs and brushes can be adapted in order to achieve particular effects, whether it be quick and even coverage or root/hairline touch up, or highlights or streaks. Alternatively, the container or one of the containers may be provided with a comb attached to or instead of the dispensing nozzle whereby the product is dispensed through hollow tines and dispensing apertures located in the comb tines. The comb tines may be provided with single or multiple openings along the tines to improve product application and evenness especially root to tip. Product dispensation can be achieved by mechanical pressure applied to the container for example delaminating bottles or any of the mechanisms described hereinabove. The comb may be provided on the container such as to facilitate easy application and may be positioned vertically (so called verticomb) or at an angle to allow the consumer to access all areas. All devices may be designed to have inter-changeability, so that a range of different tools for hair application can be provided to the consumer. The application devices may also include devices which assist in achieving particular effects such as highlighting such as highlighting combs, brushes and tools, foils and highlighting caps. Additional device technology can be used to assist in the penetration of the product into the hair. Examples of such technology include heating devices, ultraviolet light devices and ultrasound devices. Test methods Viscosity test method Viscosity measurements are carried out on a controlled stress rheometer of AR500, AR1000 or AR2000 type manufactured by TA Instruments, or equivalent instrument. A 6 cm flat acrylic cross hatched parallel plate geometry (TA item 518600.901) and a stainless steel cross hatched base plate (TA item 570011.001) are used. The rheometer is prepared for flow measurements as per standard manufacturer procedure. The parallel plate geometry gap is set to 1000 microns. The flow procedure is programmed to the rheometer with the following conditions: continuous stress ramp 0.1 - 300 Pa over 2 minutes at 25°C, including 250 measurement points in linear mode. The final hair colouring mixture is prepare for example by mixing the required parts of the composition in a professional hair stylist's mixing bowl with the professional hair stylist's brush to ensure the even mixed consistency (standard mixing time 1 minute). The product is loaded into the geometry as per standard procedure and the measurement commences at 5 min after the mixture preparation. Shear stress value at 10 sec-1 shear rate is obtained from the shear stress vs. shear rate curve, and the corresponding viscosity is calculated by dividing the obtained shear stress by 10. Root adhesion test method 40g of the composition mixture is placed in a black plastic bowl at room temperature. The composition is stirred and then pushed with a brush to one side of the bowl. Immediately thereafter, the interface between the composition and the bowl composition is observed by a trained professional stylist and a Root Adhesion index is assigned to the composition as described below: RA 0 =No crackingRA 1 = Short weak cracking, formed within 3 secRA 2 = Short cracking, formed within 5 secRA 3 =Long cracking, formed within 10 secRA 4 = Very long cracking, formed within 15 sec,RA 5 =. Intensive long cracking, continuing to form after 15 sec. Examples The following examples illustrate hair colouring or bleaching compositions according to the present invention.
