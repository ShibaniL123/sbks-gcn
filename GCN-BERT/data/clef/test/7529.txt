lO ZO This invention relates in general to narrow band optical systems, and more particularly to electrodeless discharge lamp apparatus for use in such systems. In United States Patent 2,975,330 issued March 14, 1961, there is disclosed an electrodeless discharge lamp in which an optical discharge is excited by an external radio frequency coil. Under proper thermal operating conditions, it is possible to concentrate the optical output of this lamp in very narrow spectral bands with a minimum of intensity fluctuation and noise. Such lamps are important in various highresolution optical systems, and, in particular, have contributed to the recent development of commercially feasible instruments employing the princìple of optical transmission monitoring of magnetic sublevels of atoms or other quantum systems. It is the principal object of the present invention to provide an improved electrodeless discharge lamp of the above-described type which is characterized by compactness and ruggedness of construction, and by enhanced efficiency, stability and reliability of operation. One feature of the present invention is the provision of a novel lamp bulb, adapted to minimize self-reversal of spectral lines under high frequency excitation. Another feature of t e present invention is the provïsion of a special krypton gas filling which provides optimum stability, reliability of operation, and ease of starting in an alkali metal vapor discharge lamp. Another feature of the present invention is the provision of a herrnetìcally sealed atmospheric pressure air chamber for maintaining an optimum thermal environment for the larnp bulb under ai1 operating conditions. Another feature of the present invention is the provision of a simple and efficient high frequency oscillator circuit for energizing a discharge excitation coil. Still another feature of the present invention is the provision of an inside-out excitation coil configuration permitting easy starting of an electrodeless discharge. • ••• •/i• i• i iii•• •••••• ! Ii ••• i• / ••/•• These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon a perusal of the following specífication taken in connection with the accompanying drawing, wherein: Fig. 1 is an elevational view, partly in cross section, Of an electrodeless discharge lamp in accordance wit the present invention, Fig. Z is a cross sectional view taken along line Z-Z in Fig. I, Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of the oscillator circuit used to excite the lamp of Fig. i, and Fig. 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating the arrangement of certain elements in an optical monitoring system. In Fig. i, there is shown, on an approximate Z:l scale, an extremely compact and light-weight lamp structure capable of withstanding extreme thermal and vibrational envirònmental conditions, and particularly useful as a high intensity source of alkali metal vapor "D" line radiation in a compact and portable optical monitoring instrument package. The lamp bulb 1 is press-fitted by means of the thickened, protruding wall Z of a small alkali metal reservoir 3 into a flexible silicone rubber spacer zl cemented to a copper-clad, glass epoxy printed circuit board 5, and is captured in spring-like engagement by the split winding Z0 excitation coil 6 which extends from the circuit board 5. The bulb 6 is maintained in a thermal environment of air at atmospheric pressure by means of a glass dome 7 resin-sealed to circuit board 5, a small crescentshaped silicone rubber supporting spacer 8 being pressed between the dome 7 and the bulb I. Secured to the underside of the circuit board is a selfregulating constant current oscillator circuit, to be described in detail with reference to Fig. 3, including a pair of subminiature triode amplifier tubes 9 energized through power supply terminal 11, heater terminal lZ and ground lug terminal 13, whichare mounted on au aluminum header 14. Also mounted on the header 14 is a pair of segmented cylindrical aluminum heat blocks 15 to which are attached a pair of silver-plated clamps 16 engaging tubes 9 in good heat conducting relation. A silicone rubber 0-ring 17 cemented to the top of heat blocks 15 provides a cushion support for the circuit board 5. The entire lamp-oscillator assembly is removably -Zz0 inserted in a snugly fitting aluminum housing sleeve 18 and ís tightly cushioned against the reflector 19 enclosing the upper end of sleeve by means of 0-ring Z0. The bulb is about one centimeter in diameter in order to provide a small, intense source capable of sharp focusing. The minimum excitation frequency for this bulb size is about 60 rnc. However, higher frequencies are found to yield narrower emission lines, less intensíty noise, and a slower rate of metal clean-up, apparently due to the shorter means free path per cycle of the charged particles in the discharge. A very simple, efficiint and low-noise circuit for obtaining a suitable excitation is shown in Fig. 3. The excítation coil 6 functions as a self-resonant tank coil fed in push-pull by the triode amplifier tubes 9 which are crosscoupled through grid-plate feedback capacitors 30 to maintain oscíllations at about i00 roc. The grid leak resistor 3Z establishes a negative bias for class C operation. Plate resistor 31, lead-in capacitors 33, and Filament capacítors 34 function to decouple r.f. frequency components from the d.c. power supply. It will be noted that two halves of the excitation coil 6 are wound in an inside-out relation; that is, the two end turns 35 are placed adjacent each other. When the discharge is initiated a strong electric field will be established between these end turns to nid in the striking of the discharge, the discharge being thereafter maintained by the r.f. magnetic field of the coi1 6 which uniformly threads the bulb 1 in close-coupled relation Further, this split coil arrangement minimizes the blocking of useful optical radiation. A large internal impedance constant-current plate power supply is used so that the plate voltage, and hence r.f. output power, varíes directly wRh the conductivity of the lamp discharge. Since the intensity of the discharge is directly related to its conductivìty, changes in lamp intensity are stabilized by counteracting changes in excitation power. Also, the constant-current supply provides a transient over-voltage for initiating the discharge. In an exemplary embodiment, the total power i i!i ii!i !! i i!!! ! !iiii i i i !ili ii i ii! iii!!!i i0 Z0 consumption, including heater power, was only about 6 watts. The bulb 1 is made of a material which exhibits a moderate amount of electrical loss at the lamp excitation frequency. One material which is quite suitable for this purpose, and also has the further advantage of being simple to fabricate, having no tendency to dissolve the alkali metal and being capable of withstanding substantial thermal shock, is a borosilicate glass, such as a glass available under thè trade mark PYREX 7740, having a thermal expansion coefficient of 32.5 x i0"7, density defined by a specific gravity of Z. 35 and a modulus of elasticity of 9.5 x 10-6 lb./sq, in. , among other things and blown to a thickness ín the approximate range of 5 to i0 mils. The excitation energy dìssipated by the bulb will then be divided between the glass and the discharge, the penetration of the excitation field being" limited by the conductivity of the discharge. Under these conditions, the atoms giving rise to the spectral radiation are those close to the bulb which are maintained at a proper radiåting temperature by the power dissipated in the glass, thereby minimizing a phenomenon known as self-reversal whereby the optical radiation is self-absorbed by intervening cold atoms which have a narrow absorption line corresponding with the emission line of the radiating atoms. Further, this arrangement has an additional stabilizíng influence on the discharge since the tendency of the discharge to weaken, for example, is counteracted by an increase in the amount of radio frequency power dis - sipated in the discharge resulting from the accompanyìng decrease in conductivity. In order to enable the easy starting of an alkali vapor dlscharge,it had been usual to include a filling gas such as argon. The use of such a filling, however, frequently lead to a Phenomenon whereby the discharge was transferred back and forth from the filling gas to the alkali vapor, resulting in severe intensity oscillations. We have discovered that a filling gas of krypton at a pressure between 1 and 3 mm. Hg. completely eliminates this oscillation instability while still permitting ease of starting and reliable high spectral quality operation. Use of the radioactive isotope krypton -85 in the lamp filling has been found to still further reduce the starting requirements whenever such reduction is required. Exemplary rubidium vapor spectral lamps containing one milligram of rubidium mixed wit a 2 mm. Hg. krypton filling were tested and found to have a minimum expected lire of 1,000 hours with complete stability. The krypton filling is useful with isotopically enriched rubidium as well as natural rubidium. Natural rubidium lamps, however, are generally preferable since they have been found effective in the optical monitoríng of optical absorption cells enriched in either rubidium-85 or rubidium-87, and yet they avoidthe i0 difficulty of processing enriched rubidium which is generally available only in salt compounds. The bulb i is quite simply maintained in a constant thermal insulating environment by the atmospheric pressure air bubble hermetically sealed under glass dome 7. This is as effective as a good vacuum in maintaining the discharge at an optimum temperature (about 130°C in the case of rubidium) regardless of external conditions, and also insures that the discharge is confined to the lamp even at very low external pressures. The temperature of the metal reservoír 3 is maintained at a temperature (about 100°C íu the case of rubidium) yielding an optimum vapor Z0 pressure in the discharge by means of a heat leak path through reservoir wall 2, spacer 3 and circuit board 5, the heat generated by tubes 19 being dissipated throughout the housing 18 to form an effective heat sink at a temperature of about 50 - 60° C. Since the temperature of the reservoir is less than that of t e discharge region, condensation of vapor on the lamp walls and dlscharge-disturbing migration of metal particles are prevented. An example of an optical monitoring system is shown in Fig. 4. The optical beam from a rubidium spectral bulb 1 is successively passed through an interference filter 40 which suppresses the 7800 DZ line whi1 e passing the 7948 Â DI line, a circular polarizer 41, nd an optical absorptìon cell 42 containing enriched rubidium-85 vapor, and is intercepted by photocell 43. The ground state of the atoms > in the cell 42 is split by the external magnetíc field into several magnetic sublevels separated by a frequency of 4.66 " 5 m il !i 4•. Z0 :4-" cycles per gamma (i gamma = i0-5 gauss), one of these sublevels being non-absorbing with respect to the filtered and polarized light beam passing through the cell 4Z. Under the influence of the optical radiation most of the atoms will be rapidly oriented in the non-absorbing sublevel by a process known as optical pumping whereby the absorbing atoms are raised to the excited P state and decay back to the non-absorbing sublevel. If a radio frequency current at precisely the frequency of sublevel separation is applied to the coil 44 surrounding the absorption cell 4Z, the population of atoms in the various sublevels will equalize and produce a signal in the photocell 43 due to the increased absorption by the cell. This system finds one important application as a magnetometer in which the coil frequency giving rise to the photocell signal indícates the magnitude of the external'magnetic field. To minimize dístortion of the magnetic field being measured, ceramic-titanium triodes 9 are used. In view of the push-pull symmetry of the excítation circuit, the magnetic fields arising from the d.c. plate current are effectively cance11 ed to a first order. To still further" reduce the distortion it may be necessary to couple the tubes to the excitation coil through a long transmission line. In another exemplary embodiment (not shown), the cell 4Z is filled with an enriched rubidium-87 vapor and placed in a microwave cavity,' the filter 40 and the polarizer 41 being replaced by a filter cell containing an enriched rubidium-85 vapor. Under these conditions a signal will appear in the photocell when the frequency of the signal applied to the microwave cavity is equal to the 6834 megacycle hyperfine transitíon frequency. Since this transition is independent of the external magnetic field, the signal derived from photocell 43 canbe used to stabilize the frequency of the microwave signal source and thereby provide an atomic frequency standard. Since the spectral intensity of the lamp 1 is highly resolved withín the absorption line of the cell 43, the optical intensity outside this line, which would contribute noise, but no signal, is substantially reduced. As previously discussed, there exists very little intensity" fluctuation in the • ;i¸ r. • ï' i0 radiation which does contribute to the signal. Thus the optical monitoring instruments according to the present invention are characterized by extremely high sensitivity and low noise. With reference to the described embodiments, for example, magnetometer sensitivities of .01 gamma» and short-rime frequency standard stabilities of 1 part in I012 are now reliably obtained.
