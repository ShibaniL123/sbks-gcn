TRAVEL SUPPORT DEVICE FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to supports and in particular to leg and/or foot supports for use in conjunction with a seat during travel. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It should be noted that reference to the prior art herein is not to be taken as an acknowledgement that such prior art constitutes common general knowledge in the art. Travelling has become a very common part of life, whether it is for work, visiting friends or family or for a vacation. People often travel for long periods during which time they are seated in a chair and are generally sedentary. In particular, travelling in airplanes requires a passenger to be seated in a cramped position for many hours. Travelling in trains, buses and the like can also see a passenger seated for long periods of time in awkward and uncomfortable positions. Sitting for long periods can become very uncomfortable and can lead to tired and aching muscles, swollen legs, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and even the life threatening condition of pulmonary emboli. Furthermore, it can be difficult to sleep in an upright seated position and travelers can often become sleep deprived. All of these factors make travelling for long periods uncomfortable. Also passengers often require significant recovery time which is detrimental to work commitments or enjoyment of vacation time. Several devices have been developed in order to make travelling more comfortable and/or to help prevent DVTs. Some such devices include padded or inflatable neck supports, which facilitate sleeping in a chair, and back supports that prevent an aching back. These neck and back supports are useful to provide an alternative position however for many people they do not provide enough comfort to significantly ameliorate the effects mentioned above. Some passenger chairs in airplanes, trains and buses have the ability to recline partially and/or have an extendible foot rest built into the chair. More commonly, a passenger chair can have a fold down foot rest at the back such that the person sitting in the chair behind can rest their feet on the foot rest however in saying that most airlines have removed their footrests. Personal inflatable foot rests have also been developed which allow a person to take the foot rest with them in different vehicles. It is desirable to be able to raise one's feet and legs to reduce fatigue and pain, to increase blood flow in the venous system a nd therefore to help prevent DVTs. It is also advantageous to be able to sleep comfortably on your side with legs supported . However, these foot rests only raise the legs by a small distance and for many people do not provide the support required for comfort, improved blood flow or sleeping . Other devices often used to prevent DVTs include pressure stockings or socks which apply pressure to the a nkles and calves to discourage pooling of blood in the veins of the legs. Inflatable leg compression devices have also been used to apply pressure to the legs to prevent pooling of blood in the legs. These compression devices can be uncomfortable and can be cumbersome or inconvenient if a passenger needs to get up and move around . Accordingly, it would be advantageous of the present invention to provide a contrivance which ameliorates one or more of the disadvantages set forth above or at least provide the public with a useful choice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises a support device for use in conjunction with a seat. The device, in the preferred embodiments is particularly suited for use with vehicle seats, such as cars, buses, coaches, vessels or aircrafts to provide support to a user during short and long travel journeys. The device is preferably portable, easily assembled and compactable as will be described making it particularly well suited for travel applications. Three preferred embodiments of the support device 10 of the invention will be described with reference to the drawings. Referring to Figures 1 to 13, a first preferred embodiment of a support device 10 for use in conjunction with a seat (in particular a seat of a travel vehicle) is shown. Figures 11 and 12 show a main body of the support device 10 in an unassembled or spread out state to illustrate the components of the body. Relative positions of various parts, portions and sections of this main body will now be described with reference to the substantially spread out state. As shown, the device 10 comprises a main body that is formed from one or more sheets of material to provide a body structure that can be manipulated to adjust a three dimensional form of the body for achieving a support structure in the assembled state (see figure 1 for example). The main body of the device 10 comprises a front section 12 having a central body portion and a pair of lateral wing portions 19 extending from either side of the central body portion, and a tail section 14 comprising a length of material extending longitudinally from an end of the central body portion. The central body portion comprises a front part 20 and a rear part 21. The tail section 14 extends from adjacent the rear part 21 of the central body portion. Any one or more of the portions, parts or sections described thus far may be integrally formed, or separately formed or cut and fixedly coupled to one another via sewing/stitching, adhesive or any other suitable coupling means. The front section 12 is preferably of a greater width (at its widest region) than the tail section 14. The tail section is preferably of a uniform width along its length and of a sufficient length to extend at least along a substantial portion of the seating region of a seat. It will be appreciated that in alternative embodiments the tail section may be non-uniform in width along its length. Each wing portion 19 comprises a pair of outer edges 28 and 30. The first outer edge 28 extends obtusely from an outer leading edge of the front part 20 and the second outer edge 30 extends from a terminal end of the first edge 28 towards the tail section 14. The outer edges 28 and 30 are preferably approximately orthogonal to one another. Each outer edge 28 and 30 has one or more attachment members 24/26 provided along at least a portion of the length of the edge 28/30. In the preferred embodiment, an attachment member 24 extends along the length of the edge 28 and an attachment member 26 extends along the edge 30 of the wing portion 19, for each wing portion 19. A complementary attachment member in the form of a strap 18 extends adjacent and/or between the members 24 and 26 for interchangeably coupling to one of the members 24 and 26, for each wing portion 19. In the preferred embodiments the attachment members 24, 26 and 18 are part of a hook and loop fastening system but may alternatively couple one another via any other suitable fastening mechanisms known in the art such as buckles, snap-fit engagements and the like. The attachment members 24, 26 and 18 are preferably sewn onto the respective edges 28 and 30 but may be coupled to the wings 19 in any other well-known manner. In the preferred embodiments, the device may further comprises one or more removable pillows or cushions 16 for use with the device in situ as will be described in further detail below. The main body of the device 10 is foldable along at least the following regions: at the junction between the tail section 14 and front section 12, at the junctions between each wing portion 19 and the central body portion of the front section 12, and at the junction between the front part 20 and rear part 21 of the central body portion. The main body of the device 10 is at least inwardly foldable at these regions but preferably foldable in either direction. The remaining regions of the device may be substantially rigid and/or less flexible but in the preferred embodiment the entire main body is formed from one or more sheets of durable, high tensile and sheer-strength material that is/are substantially flexible and foldable in various directions and angles. In the preferred embodiment, the main body comprises one or more sheets formed from a plastics material. The main body may comprise one or more sheets formed from a textile fabric in alternative embodiments. The device 10 is foldable into a three dimensional form or structure suitable for supporting at least a lower body portion of the user. In both the first and second preferred embodiments, the three dimensional form or structure is adjustable into one of multiple forms or structures. In the first preferred embodiment, the main body of the device 10 is adjustable between a first support form or structure and a second support form or structure. In the second preferred embodiment the device is adjustable between at least one support form or structure (most preferably first and second support forms as in the first embodiment) and also adjustable into a carry bag form or structure. Referring now to figures 1 to 5, a first support form or structure of the main body of the first preferred embodiment of the device 10 is shown. In the first support form, the device 10 comprises an open well or recess 60 configured to receive and retain a user's foot and/or leg therein. The recess 60 comprises a floor 20 and an inner peripheral wall for bounding the user's leg and/or foot therein. The inner wall comprises at least a rear surface but preferably also include one or two side surfaces. In the preferred embodiment, the inner wall is composed of two lateral side walls 19 formed by the lateral wings 19, a rear wall 21 formed by the rear part 21 of the central body portion of the front section 12 and extending approximately orthogonally between the side walls. A floor 20 formed by the front part 20 of the central body portion of the front section 12 extends approximately orthogonally between the side walls and at a lower end of the rear wall 21. The side walls 19 and preferably also the rear wall 21 are of sufficient height in this three dimensional form of the body to extend along at least a substantial portion of the user's lower leg when a user's foot is resting on the floor 20. This provides support to the user's leg as well as their foot enhancing support and increasing the range of possible comfortable seating positions. In this preferred form the front or anterior part of the recess is substantially open at least adjacent the floor 20 to enable a user to extend their foot and/or leg beyond the recess 60 if desired. The front end of the recess in the preferred embodiment is open from the floor and up substantially along the entire height of the side walls 19. In alternative embodiments the recess 60 is further bounded by a front wall at the anterior part of the recess. The rear wall 21 may extend along the entire height of the side walls 19 but in the preferred embodiment extends along a portion of the height of the side wall 19 from the floor 20. The general orientation of the recess 60 is preferably approximately orthogonal to the general orientation of the seating surface of the user's seat and/or along a plane substantially parallel to the floor of the vehicle. The tail section 14 extends from the rear wall 21 of the recess 60 and is configured to extend along at least a portion of a seating surface of a user's seat in situ. The tail section 14 is preferably of a length sufficient to extend along a substantial part of the length of the seating surface and of a width sufficient to extend across a substantial part of the width of the seating surface. The tail section 14 is configured to be fixed in position on the seat to form a first anchoring region for the device 10 in situ. In the preferred embodiment, the tail section 14 is configured to be fixed in position on the seat by friction caused by the weight of a user sitting on top of the tail section 14 and seat. Alternatively or in addition one or more attachment members may be provided to the tail section for sufficiently fixing the tail section 14 in position relative to the seat. The device 10 is configured to couple a support structure separate from a user's seat at an opposing end to the tail section 14. The support structure in some embodiments may be part of the user's seat. The support structure is preferably located in front of a seating surface of a user's seat. Attachment members 18, 24 and 26 associated with the wings/side walls 19 form the second and third anchors by fixing the body at either side of the formed recess 60 to a support structure in front of the user's seat. In the preferred embodiment the attachment member/strap 18 on either side of the recess 60 is configured to loop around a part of the support structure. In one implementation of the preferred embodiment, the support structure is a tray table of a seat in a vehicle such as an aircraft and the attachment members 18 are configured to loop around support arms 32 on either side of the tray table. It will be appreciated that the device 10 is configured for use with many other applications and implementations and is not intended to be limited for use with a tray table structure. In the first support form of the first preferred embodiment, each attachment member is couple to the complementary attachment member 24 of the associated side wall 19. In conjunction with the weight of a user's body part 20 this creates tension along the front edge 28 of each side wall 19 to help maintain an upright recess 60 during use. In the first support form, the upper edge 30 of each side wall 19 is collapsed so not to obstruct a user's body part between the edge of the seating surface and the recess 60 in use. For further stability non-slip material can is attached to the straps 18 so that when the leg and foot support 10 is in use the non-slip material makes contact with the support structures 32, preventing the straps 18 from slipping. This is particularly useful when the straps 18 are attached to the arms of a tray table on an airplane. As previously described, the device 10 preferably further comprises at least one removable pillow 16 sized and configured to be retained on the floor 20 of the recess 60 to provide comfort for the user 34 and to provide a means to retain an open structure of the recess 60. The pillow 16 retains an open space so that the user 34 can move their legs more freely when the device 10 is in use. Figure 4 best exemplifies the way in which the pillow 16 holds the recess open. The pillow 16 is preferably inflatable to adjust the size and/or softness of the pillow as desired by the user. In some embodiments the pillow 16 may be securely fixed to the floor 20 of the body of the device 10. In the preferred embodiment, the relative positions of the complementary attachment members 18 and 24 are adjustable to adjust the positon, and in particular the vertical position or height, of the floor 20 of the recess 60 relative to the support structure. In the preferred embodiment, the floor 20 and recess 60 are suspended above the floor of the vehicle in a majority of the adjustment positions in use. In one or more adjustment positions the floor 20 may rest on the floor of the vehicle. The adjustment positions may be discrete or continuous. In some embodiments the relative position between members 18 and 24 is non-adjustable. In use, a user's foot and/or leg lies on the pillow 16 or floor 20. Due to the slight lifting of the foot or leg 36 off the ground the user is placed in a more comfortable seating position. Besides the positioning of the foot, the pillow also relieves pressure from the bottom of the foot, enhancing user comfort. This is particularly appealing for travelers who spend extended periods of time sitting, for example on trains or planes. In addition to the comfort provided the leg and foot support 10 also reduces the swelling of the user's feet and legs. Sitting for extended periods can reduce blood flow in veins of the legs both due to constant pressure and reduced motility. Raising the legs can reduce this pressure and therefore may reduce the risk of DVT. To achieve the first support form, a user can fold both lateral wings 19 inwardly towards one another to an erect position where they are preferably substantially orthogonal to the front part 20 of the central body portion. The straps 18 can then be looped around the support structure and coupled to the complementary attachment members 24 at the desired position. The tail section 14 can then be extended over the user's seat for a user to sit on and fix in place, thus opening up the recess 60 and allowing the user to rest their leg and or foot therein. One or more pillows 16 can be removably inserted into the recess to enhance comfort. In the first preferred embodiment the main body is adjustable in form into either the first support form described above or a second support form. The form of the device can be adjusted in situ. Referring to figures 6-10 in the second support form, a rest or platform 40 is also provided in addition to the recess 60 at a higher position than the floor 20 of the recess 60. In the second support form a user has the option of positioning their leg and/or foot on the higher level platform 40 only and/or as well as within the recess 60. The platform 40 is provided by an inner end of the tail section 14 adjacent the recess 60 and locates between the recess and the user's seat in situ. A general orientation of the platform 40 is preferably approximately parallel with the general orientation of the seating surface of the user's seat or floor of the recess 60. In order to achieve the second form the straps 18 are placed over the support structures 32 as they were for the first form, but they are attached to the sidewalls 19 at second complementary attachment members 26, extending along top edges 30 of the sidewalls 19. This tensions the upper edges 30 of the side walls 19 to provide support and lift up the inner end of the tail section 14. The complementary attachment members 18 and 26 therefore provide tension between the front of the recess 60 and the inner end of the tail section 14. Further, the tail section 14 is positioned such that the inner end 40 is left suspended over the front of the seat 22 in use. The inner end 40 becomes a raised rest or platform 40. The tail section 14 is still maintained in its position by the weight of the user 34 and/or other necessary attachments, when in use. With the straps 18 attached to the sidewalls 19 in this fashion the raised platform 40 becomes a sling like structure that can be tensioned or loosened by adjusting the position of the tail section relative to the seat 22. In the preferred embodiment, the relative positions of the complementary attachment members 18 and 26 are adjustable to adjust the length of the platform 40. The adjustment positions may be discrete or continuous. In some embodiments the relative position between members 18 and 26 is non-adjustable. The base of the raised platform 40 is at a higher level than the floor 20 and/or pillow 16 in use. One or more pillows or cushions may be removably or fixedly placed on the platform 40 in some embodiments. In the second support form of the first preferred embodiment, the user is able to raise their knees 37 as shown in figure 10 which may provide further comfort and/or may provide a relieving variation in seating position to the traveler, especially for those that find sitting in compact position more comfortable. The combination of the first form and second form provide many alternatives to the user during their time in the seated position. Travelling for extended periods sitting in one position can be uncomfortable even if relieved by the raising of the user's foot or leg. If a person is able to change from one comfortable seating position to another, travel discomfort can be minimized. The first form and the second form provide these various alternative seating positions. As described above, the main body is preferably formed from a light weight, flexible and durable material. Accordingly, the main body may be rolled, folded or otherwise compacted to a substantially compact and portable size for transporting the device with ease. Figures 13 and 14 show the device 10 in a compacted state. A bag 50 is provided for retaining the body therein for transport. A quick release connecting device 52 is fixedly attached to the bag 50. The quick release connecting device 52 can be easily removably attached to a belt loop 54 as shown in figure 14. The quick release connecting device 52 can also be attached to a piece of luggage or the like (not shown). In its transportable form the device 10 is light weight and compact and can be carried around easily. The one or more pillows 16 may also be deflatable and compactable to be retained within the same bag 50. Referring now to figures 15 to 21, a second preferred embodiment of the device 10 will now be described. In the second preferred embodiment the main body can be adjusted or manipulated into at least one support form and into a carry bag form. For the second preferred embodiment, as shown in figure 15, the structure and shape of the main body is the same as in the first preferred embodiment. The structure will therefore not be described in further detail and the same numerals will be used to describe the same portions, parts or sections of that structure. Furthermore, preferably in the second embodiment, the main body is adjustable between a first support form and a second support form as described for the first embodiment. As such, the recess 60 of the first and second forms and the platform 40 of the second form will not be described again in detail. It will be appreciated however that in some variations of the second embodiment, the main body may only provide a reconfiguration into one of the support forms, by for example only providing one of the attachment members 24 or 26 at the side walls 19. In the second preferred embodiment, the main body is further adjustable into a carry bag or pouch form. To achieve this, the main body is modified in the second preferred embodiment such that the front part 20 of the central body portion of the main body is adjustable in length along an outer peripheral edge 20a of the part. Referring to figure 15, a draw string 68 is preferably provided through a seam along the edge 20a for example to achieve this lengthening and shortening of the length of the leading edge 20a of front part 20. The edge 20a is preferably fixedly adjustable between an extended position (shown in figure 15) for use of the main body as a support and a shortened position (shown in figure 16) for use of the main body as a pouch (sometimes in addition to a support). The draw string is tied to fix the edge in the shortened position as shown in figure 16. Other adjustment mechanisms may be provided in alternative embodiments. To achieve the carry bag or the pouch form of the device, the main body is manipulated in the following manner. The edge 20a is shortened in length to draw the lateral wings 19 towards one another at a front end of the wings (figure 16). The lateral wings 19 are then inwardly folded towards one another and collapsed onto the central body portion where their respective edges 28 are substantially aligned (figure 17). A fixing mechanism (not shown) is provided to the device 10 to releasably couple the edges 28 of the wings 19. This forms a receptacle or pouch 70 as shown in figure 18 that is capable of retaining one or more user items therein. The pouch 70 is bounded by a floor and an inner peripheral wall formed by the front and rear parts 20 and 21 of the central body portion of the main body and wings portions 19. The tail section 14 can be folded into the pouch and over the retained item(s) to cover, protect and/or retain the item(s) in the pouch as shown in figure 19. The device may further comprise one or more straps (preferably removable) to allow the pouch to be carried over the shoulder, arm or in the hands of the user for transporting the items as shown in figure 20. The provision of an edge 20a that is adjustable in length also means that the recess 60 may be turned into a pouch 70 having a front wall 71 extending from the floor 20 for storing item(s) when the device 10 is in the second support form as shown in figure 21. The addition of a front wall 71 extending from the floor 20 of the pouch 70 helps to retain item(s) within the receptacle/pouch 70. The platform 40 is still usable as a foot and/or leg rest making the device multi-purpose in this configuration. Referring to figure 22, in a third preferred embodiment a pair of attachment straps 18a and 18b are provided on either side of the body. In this embodiment a secondary strap is provided to strengthen the connection between the device and the support structure for heavier users. In particular, a relatively longer primary strap 18b is provided to attach to either corresponding attachment member 24 or 26 and manipulate the form of the device into either the first or second support form respectively as previously described, and a secondary strap 18a is also provided for attachment to the other corresponding attachment member 26 or 24 to strengthen the connection about the support structure in use. This feature of the third embodiment can be provided with any other feature of the first or second embodiment. It will be appreciated that in any of the embodiments described, the size of the main body is dependent on the application and one or more different sizes may be provided for different users, such as adults and children. The length of the adjustment members 18, 24 and 26 may also vary depending on the size of the main body and/or application. In a children's version of the device 10, the second support form may enable a child to lie across the seat and platform 40. One or more pillows may be provided on platform 40 to maintain a level structure for the child to rest upon. It is particular advantageous that the second preferred embodiment is utilized for the children's version of the device as the pouch 70 can be used in the second support form to retain a child's items while they rest upon the created platform 40 and seat. The device 10 is light weight and flexible. This allows for easy maneuverability when in use and is therefore able to be set in many and varied positions that provide most comfort for the user with very little effort. The foregoing description of the invention includes preferred forms thereof. Modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the accompanying claims. 1.
